The overwhelming number of hospitalizations due to hRSV-induced ALRTI each year is due, at least in part, to the lack of licensed vaccines against this virus. Thus, hRSV infection is considered a major public health problem and economic burden in most countries. The lung pathology developed in hRSV-infected individuals is characterized by an exacerbated proinflammatory and unbalanced Th2-type immune response. In addition to the adverse effects in airway tissues, hRSV infection can also cause neurologic manifestations in the host, such as seizures and encephalopathy. Although the origins of these extrapulmonary symptoms remain unclear, studies with patients suffering from neurological alterations suggest an involvement of the inflammatory response against hRSV. Furthermore, hRSV has evolved numerous mechanisms to modulate and evade the immune response in the host. Several studies have focused on elucidating the interactions between hRSV virulence factors and the host immune system, to rationally design new vaccines and therapies against this virus. Here, we discuss about the infection, pathology, and immune response triggered by hRSV in the host.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The infection, pathology, and immune response triggered by hRSV in the host are discussed, to rationally design new vaccines and therapies against this virus."}},"tag":"OTHER"},{"id":185,"details":{"paperId":"a7003c6a0e75022a3d9121f6859c1a3d5023db09","externalIds":{"MAG":"2074807977","DOI":"10.1080/01652176.1991.9694284","CorpusId":"6998424","PubMed":"2021054"},"title":"Human and bovine respiratory syncytial virus: immunopathologic mechanisms.","abstract":"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the major respiratory tract pathogen of infants and young children.

It is the leading cause of acute bronchiolitis and one of the most common causes of infant viral death worldwide, with infection typically occurring as recurrent seasonal epidemics. There are two major RSV subtypes, A and B, and multiple genotypes, which can coexist during RSV epidemic season every year and result in different disease severity. Recently, new RSV genomic sequences and analysis of RSV genotypes have provided important data for understanding RSV pathogenesis. Novel RSV strains do spread rapidly and widely, and a knowledge of viral strain-specific phenotypes may be important in order to include the more virulent strains in future therapeutical options and vaccine development.

Here high-resolution quantitative imaging, bioenergetics measurements and mitochondrial membrane potential- and redox-sensitive dyes are used to define RSV’s impact on host mitochondria for the first time, delineating RSV-induced microtubule/dynein-dependent mitochondrial perinuclear clustering, and translocation towards the microtubule-organizing centre. These changes are concomitant with impaired mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Strikingly, agents that target microtubule integrity the dynein motor protein, or inhibit mitochondrial ROS production strongly suppresses RSV virus production, including in a mouse model with concomitantly reduced virus-induced lung inflammation. The results establish RSV’s unique ability to co-opt host cell mitochondria to facilitate viral infection, revealing the RSV-mitochondrial interface for the first time as a viable target for therapeutic intervention.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"RSV’s unique ability to co-opt host cell mitochondria to facilitate viral infection is established, revealing the RSV-mitochondrial interface for the first time as a viable target for therapeutic intervention."}},"tag":"OTHER"}]
