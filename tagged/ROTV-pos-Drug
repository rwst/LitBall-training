ABSTRACT Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are the major cause of severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children under 5 years of age, annually resulting in nearly 130,000 deaths worldwide. Social conditions in developing countries that contribute to decreased oral rehydration and vaccine efficacy and the lack of approved antiviral drugs position RVA as a global health concern. In this minireview, we present an update in the field of antiviral compounds, mainly in relation to the latest findings in RVA virion structure and the viral replication cycle. In turn, we attempt to provide a perspective on the possible treatments for RVA-associated AGE, with special focus on novel approaches, such as those representing broad-spectrum therapeutic options. In this context, the modulation of host factors, lipid droplets, and the viral polymerase, which is highly conserved among AGE-causing viruses, are analyzed as possible drug targets.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An update in the field of antiviral compounds is presented, mainly in relation to the latest findings in RVA virion structure and the viral replication cycle, with special focus on novel approaches, such as those representing broad-spectrum therapeutic options."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":219,"details":{"paperId":"e323f619d1dd5e15b29a71e6266226102ab38c4b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"6749957","MAG":"2958627393","DOI":"10.1097/QCO.0000000000000572","CorpusId":"196617630","PubMed":"31305493"},"title":"Current and new rotavirus vaccines","abstract":"Purpose of review As of 2019, four rotavirus vaccines have been prequalified by the WHO for use worldwide. This review highlights current knowledge regarding rotavirus vaccines available, and provides a brief summary of the rotavirus vaccine pipeline. Recent findings Data generated from use of currently available products supports their effectiveness and impact in diverse settings. Rotavirus vaccines have a favorable risk–benefit profile, but previous associations of rotavirus vaccination with intussusception necessitate continued monitoring for this rare but serious adverse event. Implementation of rotavirus vaccines was jeopardized in late 2018 and 2019 by a shortage of vaccine supply. Fortunately, with the prequalification of two additional vaccines in 2018, countries have increased choice in products with different characteristics, pricing, and implementation strategies. Other vaccines currently in development may open up further immunization strategies, such as neonatal vaccination schedules or parenteral administration. Summary Rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated impact in reducing diarrheal morbidity and mortality worldwide. As countries begin to introduce the newly prequalified vaccines, additional data will become available on the safety and effectiveness of those products. Products in the pipeline have distinct profiles and could be an essential part of the expansion of rotavirus vaccine use worldwide.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated impact in reducing diarrheal morbidity and mortality worldwide and could be an essential part of the expansion of rotavirus vaccine use worldwide."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9,"details":{"paperId":"b3478af093fb6c7290bcf654f3d7d4effab439a5","externalIds":{"MAG":"2783985358","DOI":"10.1002/mnfr.201700679","CorpusId":"3626710","PubMed":"29336526"},"title":"Human Milk Oligosaccharides as Promising Antivirals.","abstract":"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are diverse unconjugated carbohydrates that are highly abundant in human breast milk. These glycans are investigated in the context of exhibiting multiple functions in infant growth and development. They seem to provide protection against infectious diseases, including a number of poorly manageable viral infections. Although the potential mechanism of the HMO antiviral protection is rather broad, much of the current experimental work has focused on studying of HMO antiadhesive properties. HMOs may mimic structures of viral receptors and block adherence to target cells, thus preventing infection. Still, the potential of HMOs as a source for new antiviral drugs is relatively unexploited. This can be partly attributed to the extreme complexity of the virus-carbohydrate interactions and technical difficulties in HMO isolation, characterization, and manufacturing procedures. Fortunately, we are currently entering a period of major technological advances that have enabled deeper insights into carbohydrate mediated viral entry, rational selection of HMOs as anti-entry inhibitors, and even evaluation of individual synthetic HMO structures. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on glycan binding studies for rotaviruses, noroviruses, influenza viruses, and human immunodeficiency viruses. We also discuss the preventive and therapeutic potential of HMOs as anti-entry inhibitors and address challenges on the route from fundamental studies to clinical trials.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An up-to-date review on glycan binding studies for rotaviruses, norovirus, influenza viruses, and human immunodeficiency viruses is provided."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":166,"details":{"paperId":"f5111d9ef82a37835afa15abe885f0d3396a0d3d","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-07476-4","CorpusId":"256638077"},"title":"Human milk oligosaccharides, milk microbiome and infant gut microbiome modulate neonatal rotavirus infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that human milk oligosaccharides and microbiome are associated with symptomatic infection with neonatal strain G10P, and maternal components that could promote the performance of live, attenuated rotavirus vaccines are identified."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":106,"details":{"paperId":"708ff2661299585a3b72fc7839382863019a5593","externalIds":{"MAG":"2547368608","DOI":"10.1016/j.phymed.2016.11.005","CorpusId":"23008640","PubMed":"27912886"},"title":"Medicinal plants and natural molecules with in vitro and in vivo activity against rotavirus: A systematic review.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The quality of the experiments in animal studies contained certain types of bias in terms of how they were conducted and reported, and the anti-rotavirus efficacy were highlighted based on improvements in reduction on liquid stool, fecal virus shedding, small intestinal histology, levels of inflammation related cytokines and signaling receptors."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":50,"details":{"paperId":"ccfb381676d8a165384148049b0fe1d91876975a","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s00203-017-1400-3","CorpusId":"253712969"},"title":"Modulation of rotavirus severe gastroenteritis by the combination of probiotics and prebiotics","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":31,"details":{"paperId":"82b65a8f75c1d7a69bfe18c47ba9692adeee9a2f","externalIds":{"MAG":"148109975","DOI":"10.1007/0-387-33026-7_5","CorpusId":"24564258","PubMed":"16802618"},"title":"Rotavirus and rotavirus vaccines.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Once the efficacy and safety have been established, rotavirus vaccines could provide a major boost to programs for child survival."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":495,"details":{"paperId":"84c3e0e3d43785b7383119e2f509c85639039035","externalIds":{"MAG":"2132067131","DOI":"10.1146/ANNUREV.MED.57.121304.131359","CorpusId":"32424019","PubMed":"16409143"},"title":"The rotavirus vaccine saga.","abstract":"Rotavirus is the single most common cause of acute, dehydrating gastroenteritis worldwide.

Rotavirus vaccine development began in the early 1980s using a \"Jennerian\" approach based on rotaviruses that normally infect animals. Although these vaccines were found to be generally safe, protection from disease was inconsistent. The second generation of vaccines was based on the same animal viruses configured to carry the relevant coat proteins of human rotaviruses. An attenuated human rotavirus vaccine has also been developed. After close to 20 years of laboratory and clinical studies, safe and effective rotavirus vaccines are approaching regulatory approval.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"After close to 20 years of laboratory and clinical studies, safe and effective rotavirus vaccines are approaching regulatory approval."}},"tag":"DRUG"}]
