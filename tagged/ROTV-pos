One prediction of the mechanism of action of this enterotoxin was that it is secreted from virus-infected cells. In this study, the media of cultured (i) insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing NSP4, (ii) monkey kidney (MA104) cells infected with the simian (SA11) or porcine attenuated (OSU-a) rotavirus, and (iii) human intestinal (HT29) cells infected with SA11 were examined to determine if NSP4 was detectable. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis–Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and N-terminal amino acid sequencing identified, in the early media from virus-infected cells, a secreted, cleavage product of NSP4 with an apparent molecular weight of 7,000 that represented amino acids 112 to 175 (NSP4 aa112–175). The secretion of NSP4 aa112–175 was not affected by treatment of cells with brefeldin A but was abolished by treatment with nocodazole and cytochalasin D, indicating that secretion of this protein occurs via a nonclassical, Golgi apparatus-independent mechanism that utilizes the microtubule and actin microfilament network. A partial gene fragment coding for NSP4 aa112–175 was cloned and expressed using the baculovirus-insect cell system. Purified NSP4 aa112–175 increased intracellular calcium mobilization in intestinal cells when added exogenously, and in insect cells when expressed endogenously, similarly to full-length NSP4.

ABSTRACT Many RNA viruses replicate in cytoplasmic compartments (virus factories or viroplasms) composed of viral and cellular proteins, but the mechanisms required for their formation remain largely unknown. Rotavirus (RV) replication in viroplasms requires interactions between virus nonstructural proteins NSP2 and NSP5, which are associated with components of lipid droplets (LDs). We previously identified two forms of NSP2 in RV-infected cells, a cytoplasmically dispersed form (dNSP2) and a viroplasm-specific form (vNSP2), which interact with hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated NSP5, respectively, indicating that a coordinated phosphorylation cascade controls viroplasm assembly. The cellular kinase CK1α phosphorylates NSP2 on serine 313, triggering the localization of vNSP2 to sites of viroplasm assembly and its association with hyperphosphorylated NSP5. Using reverse genetics, we generated a rotavirus with a phosphomimetic NSP2 (S313D) mutation to directly evaluate the role of CK1α NSP2 phosphorylation in viroplasm formation. Recombinant rotavirus NSP2 S313D (rRV NSP2 S313D) is significantly delayed in viroplasm formation and in virus replication and interferes with wild-type RV replication in coinfection. Taking advantage of the delay in viroplasm formation, the NSP2 phosphomimetic mutant was used as a tool to observe very early events in viroplasm assembly. We show that (i) viroplasm assembly correlates with NSP5 hyperphosphorylation and (ii) vNSP2 S313D colocalizes with RV-induced LDs without NSP5, suggesting that vNSP2 phospho-S313 is sufficient for interacting with LDs and may be the virus factor required for RV-induced LD formation. Further studies with the rRV NSP2 S313D virus are expected to reveal new aspects of viroplasm and LD initiation and assembly.

To study viroplasm formation in the context of infection, we characterized two new monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for NSP2. These MAbs show high-affinity binding to NSP2 and differentially recognize distinct pools of NSP2 in RV-infected cells; a previously unrecognized cytoplasmically dispersed NSP2 (dNSP2) is detected by an N-terminal binding MAb, and previously known viroplasmic NSP2 (vNSP2) is detected by a C-terminal binding MAb. Kinetic experiments in RV-infected cells demonstrate that dNSP2 is associated with NSP5 in nascent viroplasms that lack vNSP2. As viroplasms mature, dNSP2 remains in viroplasms, and the amount of diffuse cytoplasmic dNSP2 increases. vNSP2 is detected in increasing amounts later in infection in the maturing viroplasm, suggesting a conversion of dNSP2 into vNSP2. Immunoprecipitation experiments and reciprocal Western blot analysis confirm that there are two different forms of NSP2 that assemble in complexes with NSP5, VP1, VP2, and tubulin. dNSP2 associates with hypophosphorylated NSP5 and acetylated tubulin, which is correlated with stabilized microtubules, while vNSP2 associates with hyperphosphorylated NSP5. Mass spectroscopy analysis of NSP2 complexes immunoprecipitated from RV-infected cell lysates show both forms of NSP2 are phosphorylated, with a greater proportion of vNSP2 being phosphorylated compared to dNSP2.

VP5*, the rotavirus protein believed to interact with the membrane bilayer, is a tryptic cleavage product of the outer capsid spike protein, VP4. When a rotavirus particle uncoats, VP5* folds back, in a rearrangement that resembles the fusogenic conformational changes in enveloped-virus fusion proteins. We present direct experimental evidence that this rearrangement leads to membrane binding. VP5* does not associate with liposomes when mounted as part of the trypsin-primed spikes on intact virions, nor does it do so after it has folded back into a stably trimeric, low-energy state. But it does bind liposomes when they are added to virions before uncoating, and VP5* rearrangement is then triggered by addition of EDTA. The presence of liposomes during the rearrangement enhances the otherwise inefficient VP5* conformational change. A VP5* fragment, VP5CT, produced from monomeric recombinant VP4 by successive treatments with chymotrypsin and trypsin, also binds liposomes only when the proteolysis proceeds in their presence.

One mutant, SA11-tsC, has a mutation that maps to the gene encoding the VP1 polymerase and shows diminished growth and RNA synthesis at 39°C compared to that at 31°C. In the present study, we sequenced all 11 genes of SA11-tsC, confirming the presence of an L138P mutation in the VP1 N-terminal domain and identifying 52 additional mutations in four other viral proteins (VP4, VP7, NSP1, and NSP2). To investigate whether the L138P mutation induces a ts phenotype in VP1 outside the SA11-tsC genetic context, we employed ectopic expression systems. Specifically, we tested whether the L138P mutation affects the ability of VP1 to localize to viroplasms, which are the sites of RV RNA synthesis, by expressing the mutant form as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein (VP1L138P-GFP) (i) in wild-type SA11-infected cells or (ii) in uninfected cells along with viroplasm-forming proteins NSP2 and NSP5. We found that VP1L138P-GFP localized to viroplasms and interacted with NSP2 and/or NSP5 at 31°C but not at 39°C. Next, we tested the enzymatic activity of a recombinant mutant polymerase (rVP1L138P) in vitro and found that it synthesized less RNA at 39°C than at 31°C, as well as less RNA than the control at all temperatures. Together, these results provide a mechanistic basis for the ts phenotype of SA11-tsC and raise important questions about the role of leucine 138 in supporting key protein interactions and the catalytic function of the VP1 polymerase. IMPORTANCE RVs cause diarrhea in the young of many animal species, including humans. Despite their medical and economic importance, gaps in knowledge exist about how these viruses replicate inside host cells. Previously, a mutant simian RV (SA11-tsC) that replicates worse at higher temperatures was identified. This virus has an amino acid mutation in VP1, which is the enzyme responsible for copying the viral RNA genome. The mutation is located in a poorly understood region of the polymerase called the N-terminal domain. In this study, we determined that the mutation reduces the ability of VP1 to properly localize within infected cells at high temperatures, as well as reduced the ability of the enzyme to copy viral RNA in a test tube.

The role of the zinc ion in the functions of VP6 was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutation of histidine 153 into a serine (H153S and H153S/S339H) did not prevent the formation of VP6 trimers. At pH <7.0, about the pK of histidine, wild-type and mutated VP6 proteins display similar properties, giving rise to identical tubular and spherical assemblies. However, at pH >7.0, histidine 153 mutant proteins did not assemble into the characteristic 45-nm-diameter tubes, in contrast to wild-type VP6. These observations showed that under conditions in which histidine residues are not charged, the properties of VP6 depended on the presence of the centrally coordinated zinc atom in the trimer. Indeed, wild-type VP6 depleted of the zinc ion by a high concentration (100 mM) of a metal-chelating agent behaved like the H153 mutant proteins. The susceptibility of wild-type VP6 to proteases is greatly increased in the absence of zinc. NH2-terminal sequencing of the proteolytic fragments showed that they all contained the β-sheet-rich VP6 head domain, which appeared to be less sensitive to protease activity than the α-helical basal domain. Finally, the mutant proteins assembled well on cores, as demonstrated by both electron microscopy and rescue of transcriptase activity. Zinc is thus not necessary for the transcription activity.

To identify translation-enhancement elements in the viral mRNAs that stimulate translation in vivo, chimeric RNAs were prepared that contained an open reading frame for luciferase and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of a rotavirus mRNA or of a nonviral mRNA.

Modification of VP4 has been challenging as it is involved in biological process including the interaction with sialic acid and integrins, cell tropism and hemagglutinin activity. Here, we engineered a loop at position K145-G150 in the lectin domain of the VP8* subunit to harbor a small biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) tag and rescued viable viral particles using RV reverse genetics system. This rRV/VP4-BAP internalizes, replicates, and generates virus progeny, demonstrating that the VP4 spike of RV particles can be genetically manipulated by the incorporation of at least 15 exogenous amino acids. Although, VP4-BAP had a similar distribution as VP4 in infected cells by localizing in the cytoskeleton and surrounding viroplasms. However, compared to wild-type RV, rRV/VP4-BAP featured a reduced replication fitness and impaired viroplasm stability. Upon treatment of viroplasms with 1,6-hexanediol, a drug disrupting liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates, the kinetic of rRV/VP4-BAP viroplasm recovery was delayed, and their size and numbers reduced when compared to viroplasms of wild type RV.

Deletion of the last three aa (173-175) of NS28 diminished, but did not abolish, the ligand binding activity in our assay conditions. An internal deletion of NS28 (aa 110 to 155) also significantly diminished ssp binding activity in standard binding assays. As an alternative approach to study the ssp binding domain on NS28, we mapped the epitope of binding of monoclonal antibody BA/55, which was found to block ssp binding to NS28. Immunoprecipitation experiments done with truncated mutants of NS28 located the epitope of BA/55 to aa 149-160 of NS28, immediately adjacent to or partially overlapping the putative ssp binding domain. Experiments using synthetic peptides mimicking the carboxy end of NS28, found these peptides were not able to compete for ssp binding. Together, these results suggest that the ssp binding site in NS28 (aa 161-172) is highly dependent on the conformational integrity of the cytoplasmic C-terminus of NS28.

We found that VP7 rapidly misfolds in an energy-depleted milieu and is not degraded within 60 min. We also found that VP7 attained a stable minimum-energy state soon after translation in the ER.

Our results show for the first time that the disulfide bond formation of rotavirus VP7 is an ATP-dependent process. It has previously been shown that chaperones hydrolyze ATP during interaction with newly synthesized polypeptides and prevent nonproductive intra- and intermolecular interactions. The most reasonable explanation for the energy requirement of VP7 is thus a close interaction during folding with an ATP-dependent chaperone, such as BiP (Grp78), and possibly with protein disulfide isomerase.

The current model for the assembly of the outer capsid is that it occurs within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, it has been shown that VP4 and infectious virus associate with lipid rafts, suggesting that the final assembly of the rotavirus spike protein VP4 involves a post-endoplasmic reticulum event. In this work, we found that the actin inhibitor jasplakinolide blocks the cell egress of rotavirus from nonpolarized MA104 cells at early times of infection, when there is still no evidence of cell lysis. These findings contrast with the traditional assumption that rotavirus is released from nonpolarized cells by a nonspecific mechanism when the cell integrity is lost. Inspection of the virus present in the extracellular medium by use of density flotation gradients revealed that a fraction of the released virus is associated with low-density membranous structures. Furthermore, the intracellular localization of VP4, its interaction with lipid rafts, and its targeting to the cell surface were shown to be prevented by jasplakinolide, implying a role for actin in these processes. Finally, the VP4 present at the plasma membrane was shown to be incorporated into the extracellular infectious virus, suggesting the existence of a novel pathway for the assembly of the rotavirus spike protein. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is a major etiological agent of infantile acute severe diarrhea. It is a nonenveloped virus formed by three concentric layers of protein. The early stages of rotavirus replication, including cell attachment and entry, synthesis and translation of viral mRNAs, replication of the genomic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and the assembly of double-layered viral particles, have been studied widely. However, the mechanisms involved in the later stages of infection, i.e., viral particle maturation and cell exit, are less well characterized. It has been assumed historically that rotavirus exits nonpolarized cells following cell lysis. In this work, we show that the virus exits cells by a nonlytic, actin-dependent mechanism, and most importantly, we describe that VP4, the spike protein of the virus, is present on the cell surface and is incorporated into mature, infectious virus, indicating a novel pathway for the assembly of this protein.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that the virus exits cells by a nonlytic, actin-dependent mechanism, and most importantly, it is described that VP4, the spike protein of the virus, is present on the cell surface and is incorporated into mature, infectious virus, indicating a novel pathway for the assembly of this protein."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":528,"details":{"paperId":"a95d917eebb9b3cfb8d28df9e4345c4d3e2b8a4f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"5792019","MAG":"2784018550","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1006820","CorpusId":"25624664","PubMed":"29352319"},"title":"Activation of PI3K, Akt, and ERK during early rotavirus infection leads to V-ATPase-dependent endosomal acidification required for uncoating","abstract":"The cellular PI3K/Akt and/or MEK/ERK signaling pathways mediate the entry process or endosomal acidification during infection of many viruses.

Here, we show that late-penetration (L-P) human DS-1 and bovine NCDV RVA strains stimulate these signaling pathways very early in the infection. Inhibition of both signaling pathways significantly reduced production of viral progeny due to blockage of virus particles in the late endosome, indicating that neither of the two signaling pathways is involved in virus trafficking. However, immunoprecipitation assays using antibodies specific for pPI3K, pAkt, pERK and the subunit E of the V-ATPase co-immunoprecipitated the V-ATPase in complex with pPI3K, pAkt, and pERK.

Elevated cytoplasmic calcium is absolutely required for virus replication, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for calcium influx remain poorly understood. NSP4 is an ER-localized viroporin, whose activity depletes ER calcium, which ultimately leads to calcium influx. We hypothesized that NSP4-mediated depletion of ER calcium activates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through activation of the ER calcium sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). We established and used a stable yellow fluorescent protein-expressing STIM1 cell line (YFP-STIM1) as a biosensor to assess STIM1 activation (puncta formation) by rotavirus infection and NSP4 expression. We found that STIM1 is constitutively active in rotavirus-infected cells and that STIM1 puncta colocalize with the PM-localized Orai1 SOCE calcium channel. Expression of wild-type NSP4 activated STIM1, resulting in PM calcium influx, but an NSP4 viroporin mutant failed to induce STIM1 activation and did not activate the PM calcium entry pathway. Finally, knockdown of STIM1 significantly reduced rotavirus yield, indicating STIM1 plays a critical role in virus replication. These data demonstrate that while rotavirus may ultimately activate multiple calcium channels in the PM, calcium influx is predicated on NSP4 viroporin-mediated activation of STIM1 in the ER.

Electron microscopy showed that RRV virions reacted with an anti-VP7 MAb stayed as triple-layered particles in the presence of excess EDTA. Furthermore, the infectivity of rotavirus neutralized via VP8*, but not that of rotavirus neutralized via VP7, could be recovered by lipofection of neutralized particles into MA-104 cells. These data are consistent with the notion that antibodies directed at VP8* neutralize by inhibiting binding of virus to the cell.

In vitro, simply adding the recombinant outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7 to authentic double-layered rotavirus subviral particles (DLPs) in the presence of calcium and acidic pH increases infectivity by a factor of up to 107, yielding particles as infectious as authentic purified virions. VP4 must be added before VP7 for high-level infectivity. Steep dependence of infectious recoating on VP4 concentration suggests that VP4-VP4 interactions, probably oligomerization, precede VP4 binding to particles. Trypsin sensitivity analysis identifies two populations of VP4 associated with recoated particles: properly mounted VP4 that can be specifically primed by trypsin, and nonspecifically associated VP4 that is degraded by trypsin. A full complement of properly assembled VP4 is not required for efficient infectivity. Minimal dependence of recoating on VP7 concentration suggests that VP7 binds DLPs with high affinity. The parameters for efficient recoating and the characterization of recoated particles suggest a model in which, after a relatively weak interaction between oligomeric VP4 and DLPs, VP7 binds the particles and locks VP4 in place.

Autophagy is a highly regulated cellular process in which cells destroy and recycle their own components in lysosomes. The mechanism most viruses use to induce autophagy is unknown. We show a rotavirus pore-forming protein activates a calcium-dependent signaling pathway to initiate autophagy. Rotavirus hijacks autophagy membranes to transport viral proteins to sites of virus replication for assembly of infectious particles and interferes with autophagy maturation. Inhibition of the signaling pathway blocks virus production, suggesting a therapeutic target to fight infection. Autophagy is a cellular degradation process involving an intracellular membrane trafficking pathway that recycles cellular components or eliminates intracellular microbes in lysosomes. Many pathogens subvert autophagy to enhance their replication, but the mechanisms these pathogens use to initiate the autophagy process have not been elucidated. This study identifies rotavirus as a pathogen that encodes a viroporin, nonstructural protein 4, which releases endoplasmic reticulum calcium into the cytoplasm, thereby activating a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-β and 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling pathway to initiate autophagy. Rotavirus hijacks this membrane trafficking pathway to transport viral proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to sites of viral replication to produce infectious virus. This process requires PI3K activity and autophagy-initiation proteins Atg3 and Atg5, and it is abrogated by chelating cytoplasmic calcium or inhibiting calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-β. Although the early stages of autophagy are initiated, rotavirus infection also blocks autophagy maturation.

ABSTRACT Many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm dramatically remodel and stimulate the accumulation of host cell membranes for efficient replication by poorly understood mechanisms. For rotavirus, a critical step in virion assembly requires the accumulation of membranes adjacent to virus replication centers called viroplasms. Early electron microscopy studies describe viroplasm-associated membranes as “swollen” endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously demonstrated that rotavirus infection initiates cellular autophagy and that membranes containing the autophagy marker protein LC3 and the rotavirus ER-synthesized transmembrane glycoprotein NSP4 traffic to viroplasms, suggesting that NSP4 must exit the ER. This study aimed to address the mechanism of NSP4 exit from the ER and determine whether the viroplasm-associated membranes are ER derived. We report that (i) NSP4 exits the ER in COPII vesicles, resulting in disrupted COPII vesicle transport and ER exit sites; (ii) COPII vesicles are hijacked by LC3 II, which interacts with NSP4; and (iii) NSP4/LC3 II-containing membranes accumulate adjacent to viroplasms. In addition, the ER transmembrane proteins SERCA and calnexin were not detected in viroplasm-associated membranes, providing evidence that the rotavirus maturation process of “budding” occurs through autophagy-hijacked COPII vesicle membranes. These findings reveal a new mechanism for rotavirus maturation dependent on intracellular host protein transport and autophagy for the accumulation of membranes required for virus replication. IMPORTANCE In a morphogenic step that is exceedingly rare for nonenveloped viruses, immature rotavirus particles assemble in replication centers called viroplasms, and bud through cytoplasmic cellular membranes to acquire the outer capsid proteins for infectious particle assembly.

When infected cells were depleted of Ca++ by use of the ionophore A23187 in calcium-free medium, membrane- enveloped intermediates were seen to accumulate. When Mn++, an efficient Ca++ competitor, was used to replace Ca++ in the medium, the accumulation of the enveloped intermediate was again observed, pointing to an absolute requirement of Ca++ in the maturation process.

Furthermore, while glycosylated VP7 interacted during maturation with protein disulfide isomerase, nonglycosylated VP7 did not, suggesting that glycosylation is a prerequisite for protein disulfide isomerase interaction. While native NSP4, which does not possess S-S bonds, was not dependent on N-linked glycosylation or on protein disulfide isomerase assistance for maturation, nonglycosylated NSP4 was surprisingly found to interact with protein disulfide isomerase, further suggesting that protein disulfide isomerase can act both as an enzyme and as a chaperone.

The permeability to Ca2+ and other cations was evaluated by the change of the intracellular concentration following an extracellular cation pulse. Rotavirus infection induced an increase in permeability to Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Mn2+, and Co2+. The rate of cation entry decreased over time as the intracellular concentration increased during the first 20 s. This indicates that regulatory mechanisms, including channel inactivation, are triggered. La3+ did not enter the cell and blocked the entry of the divalent cations in a dose-dependent manner.

M. Gilbert and H. B. Greenberg, J. Virol. 71:4555–4563, 1997). The conditions required for syncytium formation are similar to those for viral penetration of the plasma membrane during the course of viral infection. This VLP-mediated fusion activity was dependent on the presence of the outer-layer proteins, viral protein 4 (VP4) and VP7, and on the trypsinization of VP4. Fusion activity occurred only with cells that are permissive for rotavirus infection. Here we begin to dissect the role of VP4 in rotavirus entry by examining the importance of the precise trypsin cleavage of VP4 and the activation of VP4 function related to viral entry. We present evidence that the elimination of the three trypsin-susceptible arginine residues of VP4 by specific site-directed mutagenesis prevents syncytium formation. Two of the three arginine residues in VP4 are dispensable for syncytium formation, and only the arginine residue at site 247 appears to be required for activation of VP4 functions and cell-cell fusion. Using the recombinant VLPs in our syncytium assay will aid in understanding the conformational changes that occur in VP4 involved in rotavirus penetration into host cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Evidence is presented that the elimination of the three trypsin-susceptible arginine residues of VP4 by specific site-directed mutagenesis prevents syncytium formation, which is similar to those for viral penetration of the plasma membrane during the course of viral infection."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":227,"details":{"paperId":"2d67ac7e766f012b5a57f2a287a58ef1504314cf","externalIds":{"MAG":"2022288602","DOI":"10.1099/0022-1317-77-3-391","CorpusId":"14215557","PubMed":"8601772"},"title":"Cleavage of rotavirus VP4 in vivo.","abstract":"The infectivity of rotavirus particles is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of the outer capsid protein, VP4, at a specific site. This cleavage event yields two fragments, identified as VP5* and VP8*. It has been hypothesized that the particle is more stable, but non-infectious, when VP4 is in the uncleaved state. Uncleaved VP4 and the resultant increased stability might be advantageous for the virus to resist environmental degradation until it infects a susceptible host. When VP4 is cleaved in the lumen of the host's gastrointestinal tract, the virus particle would become less stable but more infectious. To test this hypothesis, a series of experiments was undertaken to analyse the cleavage state of VP4 on virus shed by an infected host into the environment. Immunoblots of intestinal wash solutions derived from infant and adult BALB/c mice infected with a virulent cell culture-adapted variant of the EDIM virus (EW) or wild-type murine rotavirus EDIM-Cambridge were analysed. Virtually all of the VP4 in these samples was in the cleaved form. Moreover, cell culture titration of trypsin-treated and untreated intestinal contents from pups infected with EW indicated that excreted virus is fully activated prior to trypsin addition. It was also observed that trypsin-activated virus has no disadvantage in initiating infection in naive animals over virions containing an intact VP4.

ABSTRACT One step of the life cycle common to all rotaviruses (RV) studied so far is the formation of viroplasms, membrane-less cytosolic inclusions providing a microenvironment for early morphogenesis and RNA replication. Viroplasm-like structures (VLS) are simplified viroplasm models consisting of complexes of nonstructural protein 5 (NSP5) with the RV core shell VP2 or NSP2. We identified and characterized the domains required for NSP5-VP2 interaction and VLS formation. VP2 mutations L124A, V865A, and I878A impaired both NSP5 hyperphosphorylation and NSP5/VP2 VLS formation. Moreover, NSP5-VP2 interaction does not depend on NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. The NSP5 tail region is required for VP2 interaction. Notably, VP2 L124A expression acts as a dominant-negative element by disrupting the formation of either VLS or viroplasms and blocking RNA synthesis. In silico analyses revealed that VP2 L124, V865, and I878 are conserved among RV species A to H. Detailed knowledge of the protein interaction interface required for viroplasm formation may facilitate the design of broad-spectrum antivirals to block RV replication.

Two rotavirus nonstructural proteins, NSP2 (with nucleoside triphosphatase, single-stranded RNA [ssRNA] binding and helix-destabilizing activities) and NSP5, are essential in these events. Previous structural analysis of NSP2 showed that it is an octamer in crystals, obeying 4-2-2 crystal symmetry, with a large 35-Å central hole along the fourfold axis and deep grooves at one of the twofold axes. To ascertain that the solution structure of NSP2 is the same as that in the crystals and investigate how NSP2 interacts with NSP5 and RNA, we carried out single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of NSP2 alone and in complexes with NSP5 and ssRNA at subnanometer resolution. Because full-length NSP5 caused severe aggregation upon mixing with NSP2, the deletion construct NSP566-188 was used in these studies. Our studies show that the solution structure of NSP2 is same as the crystallographic octamer and that both NSP566-188 and ssRNA bind to the grooves in the octamer, which are lined by positively charged residues. The fitting of the NSP2 crystal structure to cryo-EM reconstructions of the complexes indicates that, in contrast to the binding of NSP566-188, the binding of RNA induces noticeable conformational changes in the NSP2 octamer. Consistent with the observation that both NSP5 and RNA share the same binding site on the NSP2 octamer, filter binding assays showed that NSP5 competes with ssRNA binding, indicating that one of the functions of NSP5 is to regulate NSP2-RNA interactions during genome replication.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Cryo-EM studies show that the solution structure of NSP2 is same as the crystallographic octamer and that both NSP566-188 and ssRNA bind to the grooves in the octamer, which are lined by positively charged residues."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":10,"details":{"paperId":"1f632ea67ea1ad9fc6cbe2dd0574d44ecaa734f0","externalIds":{"MAG":"2165716275","PubMedCentral":"5068548","DOI":"10.1002/prot.24794","CorpusId":"2182935","PubMed":"25758703"},"title":"Crystal structure of the C‐terminal 2′,5′‐phosphodiesterase domain of group a rotavirus protein VP3","abstract":"In response to viral infections, the mammalian innate immune system induces the production of the second messenger 2′–5′ oligoadenylate (2–5A) to activate latent ribonuclease L (RNase L) that restricts viral replication and promotes apoptosis.

As a component of replication intermediates, NSP2 is also implicated in various replication-related activities. In addition to sequence-independent single-stranded RNA-binding and helix-destabilizing activities, NSP2 exhibits monomer-associated nucleoside and 5′ RNA triphosphatase (NTPase/RTPase) activities that are mediated by a conserved H225 residue within a narrow enzymatic cleft.

Only minor conformational alterations were observed in the cleft upon nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. This hydrolysis involved the formation of a stable phosphohistidine intermediate.

This study demonstrates that rotavirus induces the relocalization and sequestration of a large number of host proteins in viroplasms, affecting host processes in both compartments and generating conditions conducive for virus growth in the cytoplasm of infected cells. ABSTRACT Rotavirus replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells in unique virus-induced cytoplasmic inclusion bodies called viroplasms (VMs), which are nucleated by two essential viral nonstructural proteins, NSP2 and NSP5. However, the precise composition of the VM, the intracellular localization of host proteins during virus infection, and their association with VMs or role in rotavirus growth remained largely unexplored. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed the presence of several host heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), AU-rich element-binding proteins (ARE-BPs), and cytoplasmic proteins from uninfected MA104 cell extracts in the pulldown (PD) complexes of the purified viroplasmic proteins NSP2 and NSP5. Immunoblot analyses of PD complexes from RNase-treated and untreated cell extracts, analyses of coimmunoprecipitation complexes using RNase-treated infected cell lysates, and direct binding assays using purified recombinant proteins further demonstrated that the interactions of the majority of the hnRNPs and ARE-BPs with viroplasmic proteins are RNA independent. Time course immunoblot analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from rotavirus-infected and mock-infected cells and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analyses of virus-infected cells revealed a surprising sequestration of the majority of the relocalized host proteins in viroplasms. Analyses of ectopic overexpression and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of expression revealed that host proteins either promote or inhibit viral protein expression and progeny virus production in virus-infected cells. This study demonstrates that rotavirus induces the cytoplasmic relocalization and sequestration of a large number of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in viroplasms, subverting essential cellular processes in both compartments to promote rapid virus growth, and reveals that the composition of rotavirus viroplasms is much more complex than is currently understood.

The last 7 nt of the (+) strand RNA, 5'-UGUGACC-3', are highly conserved and are necessary for efficient (-) strand synthesis in vitro. Characterization of the cell-free replication system revealed that the addition of NaCl inhibited (-) strand synthesis. By preincubating open cores with (+) strand RNA and ATP, CTP, and GTP prior to the addition of NaCl and UTP, the salt-sensitive step was overcome. Thus, (-) strand initiation, but not elongation, was a salt-sensitive process in the cell-free system. Further analysis of the requirements for initiation showed that preincubating open cores and the (+) strand RNA with GTP or UTP, but not with ATP or CTP, allowed (-) strand synthesis to occur in the presence of NaCl. Mutagenesis suggested that in the presence of GTP, (-) strand synthesis initiated at the 3'-terminal C residue of the (+) strand template, whereas in the absence of GTP, an aberrant initiation event occurred at the third residue upstream from the 3' end of the (+) strand RNA. During preincubation with GTP, formation of the dinucleotides pGpG and ppGpG was detected; however, no such products were made during preincubation with ATP, CTP, or UTP. Replication assays showed that pGpG, but not GpG, pApG, or ApG, served as a specific primer for (-) strand synthesis and that the synthesis of pGpG may occur by a template-independent process.

Monolayer integrity changes in MA104, HT-29 and partially differentiated Caco-2 cells following inactivated rotavirus exposure or RRV or CRW-8 rotavirus infection paralleled cell metabolic activity and viability reductions. MA104 cell exposure to rotavirus dsRNA also altered monolayer integrity. Inactivated rotaviruses induced delayed cell function losses that were unrelated to apoptosis. Phosphatidylserine externalization, indicating early apoptosis, occurred in MA104 and HT-29 but not in partially differentiated Caco-2 cells by 11 h after infection. Rotavirus activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase partially protected MA104 and HT-29 cells from early apoptosis. In contrast, activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK by rotavirus did not influence apoptosis induction in these cells. RRV infection produced DNA fragmentation, indicating late-stage apoptosis, in fully differentiated Caco-2 cells only. These studies show that the apoptosis initiation and cell death mechanism induced by rotavirus infection depend on cell type and degree of differentiation.

To study the structure-function of the gene 5 product, wild-type and mutant forms of NS53 were produced by using a recombinant baculovirus expression system and a recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 (vTF7-3) expression system. Analysis of the RNA-binding activity of the wild-type NS53 immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose beads with NS53-specific antiserum showed that the protein exhibited specific affinity for all 11 rotavirus mRNAs. The use of short virus-specific RNA probes indicated that NS53 specifically recognizes an element located near the 5' ends of viral mRNAs. Analysis of the RNA-binding activity of deletion mutants of NS53 showed that the RNA-binding domain resides within the first 81 amino acids of the protein and that the highly conserved cysteine-rich region within this region of the protein is essential for the activity. Gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analyses of intracellular fractions derived from infected cells revealed that large amounts of NS53 were present in the cytosol and in association with the cytoskeletal matrix. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of cells programmed to transiently express mutant forms of NS53 using vTF7-3 indicated that the intracellular localization domain resides between amino acids 84 and 176 of NS53.

We used CHO cells expressing mutated α2β1 to identify amino acids involved in binding to human and animal rotaviruses. Residues where mutation affected rotavirus binding were located in several exposed loops and adjacent regions of the α2 I domain. Binding by all rotaviruses was eliminated by mutations in the activation-responsive αC-α6 and αF helices. This is a novel feature that distinguishes rotavirus from other α2β1 ligands. Mutation of residues that co-ordinate the metal ion (Ser-153, Thr-221, and Glu-256 in α2 and Asp-130 in β1) and nearby amino acids (Ser-154, Gln-215, and Asp-219) also inhibited rotavirus binding. The importance of most of these residues was greatest for binding by human rotaviruses. These mutations inhibit collagen binding to α2β1 (apart from Glu-256) but do not affect echovirus binding. Overall, residues where mutation affected both rotavirus and collagen recognition are located at one side of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site, whereas those important for collagen alone cluster nearby. Mutations eliminating rotavirus and echovirus binding are distinct, consistent with the respective preference of these viruses for activated or inactive α2β1.

To further understand how rotaviruses enter susceptible cells, six different polarized epithelial cell lines, grown on permeable filter membrane supports containing 0.4-μm pores, were infected apically or basolaterally with SA-independent or SA-dependent rotaviruses. SA-independent rotaviruses applied apically or basolaterally were capable of efficiently infecting both sides of the epithelium of all six polarized cell lines tested, while SA-dependent rotaviruses only infected efficiently through the apical surface of five of the polarized cell lines tested. Regardless of the route of virus entry, SA-dependent and SA-independent rotaviruses were released almost exclusively from the apical domain of the plasma membrane of polarized cells before monolayer disruption or cell lysis. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of cells decreased at the same time, irrespective of whether infection with SA-independent rotaviruses occurred apically or basolaterally. The TER of cells infected apically with SA-dependent rotaviruses decreased earlier than that of cells infected basolaterally. Rotavirus infection decreased TER before the appearance of cytopathic effect and cell death and resulted in an increase in the paracellular permeability to [3H]inulin as a function of loss of TER. The presence of SA residues on either the apical or basolateral side was determined using a Texas Red-conjugated lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which binds SA residues. WGA bound exclusively to SA residues on the apical surface of the cells, confirming the requirement for SA residues on the apical cell membrane for efficient infectivity of SA-dependent rotaviruses. These results indicate that the rotavirus SA-independent cellular receptor is present on both sides of the epithelium, but SA-dependent and SA-independent rotavirus strains infect polarized epithelial cells by different mechanisms, which may be relevant for pathogenesis and selection of vaccine strains.

The VP5* cleavage product selectively permeabilizes membranes and liposomes and contains an internal hydrophobic domain that is required for membrane permeability. Here we investigate VP5* domains (residues 248 to 474) that direct membrane binding. We determined that expressed VP5 fragments containing residues 248 to 474 or 265 to 474, including the internal hydrophobic domain, bind to cellular membranes but are not present in Triton X-100-resistant membrane rafts. Expressed VP5 partitions into aqueous but not detergent phases of Triton X-114, suggesting that VP5 is not integrally inserted into membranes. Since high-salt or alkaline conditions eluted VP5 from membranes, our findings demonstrate that VP5 is peripherally associated with membranes. Interestingly, mutagenesis of residue 394 (W→R) within the VP5 hydrophobic domain, which abolishes VP5-directed permeability, had no effect on VP5's peripheral membrane association. In contrast, deletion of N-terminal VP5 residues (residues 265 to 279) abolished VP5 binding to membranes. Alanine mutagenesis of two positively charged residues within this domain (residues 274R and 276K) dramatically reduced (>95%) binding of VP5 to membranes and suggested their potential interaction with polar head groups of the lipid bilayer.

We found that inhibition of rotavirus migration into lipid rafts, by either siRNAs or tunicamycin, also specifically blocked the targeting of VP4 to rafts, suggesting that the association of VP4 with rafts is mostly mediated by the formation of viral particles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We showed that two populations of VP4 exist, one small population that is independently targeted to rafts and a second large pool of VP4 whose association with rafts is mediated by particle formation in the ER.

To gain a broader perspective of NSP1 activities, we examined various RV strains for the ability to inhibit IFN-β expression in human cells. We found that all strains encoding wild-type NSP1 impeded IFN-β expression but not always through IRF3 degradation. To identify other degradation targets involved in suppressing IFN-β expression, we used transient expression vectors to test the abilities of a diverse collection of NSP1 proteins to target IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, and β-TrCP for degradation. The results indicated that human RVs rely predominantly on the NSP1-induced degradation of IRF5 and IRF7 to suppress IFN signaling, whereas NSP1 proteins of animal RVs tended to target IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7, allowing the animal viruses a broader attack on the IFN-β signaling pathway. The results also suggested that the NSP1-induced degradation of β-TrCP is an uncommon mechanism of subverting IFN-β signaling but is one that can be shared with NSP1 proteins that induce IRF degradation. Our analysis reveals that the activities of NSP1 proteins are diverse, with no obvious correlations between degradations of pairs of target proteins.

During serial passage of simian SA11 rotaviruses in cell culture, two variants emerged with gene 5 dsRNAs containing large (1.1 and 0.5 kb) sequence duplications within the open reading frame (ORF) for NSP1. Due to the sequence rearrangements, both variants encoded only C-truncated forms of NSP1. Comparison of these and other variants encoding defective NSP1 with their corresponding wild-type viruses indicated that the inability to encode authentic NSP1 results in a small-plaque phenotype. Thus, although nonessential, NSP1 probably plays an active role in rotavirus replication in cell culture. In determining the sequences of the gene 5 dsRNAs of the SA11 variants and wild-type viruses, it was unexpectedly found that their 3′ termini ended with 5′-UGAACC-3′ instead of the 3′ consensus sequence 5′-UGACC-3′, which is present on the mRNAs of nearly all other group A rotaviruses. Cell-free assays indicated that the A insertion into the 3′ consensus sequence interfered with its ability to promote dsRNA synthesis and to function as a translation enhancer. The results provide evidence that the 3′ consensus sequence of the gene 5 dsRNAs of SA11 rotaviruses has undergone a mutation causing it to operate suboptimally in RNA replication and in the expression of NSP1 during the virus life cycle. Indeed, just as rotavirus variants which encode defective NSP1 appear to have a selective advantage over those encoding wild-type NSP1 in cell culture, it may be that the atypical 3′ end of SA11 gene 5 has been selected for because it promotes the expression of lower levels of NSP1 than the 3′ consensus sequence.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results provide evidence that the 3′ consensus sequence of the gene 5 dsRNAs of SA11 rotaviruses has undergone a mutation causing it to operate suboptimally in RNA replication and in the expression of NSP1 during the virus life cycle."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":354,"details":{"paperId":"4e3ac835725a23a349a2206ec15e1d82df833dc1","externalIds":{"MAG":"2131266511","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.02461-09","CorpusId":"16265407","PubMed":"20375171"},"title":"Effect of Mutations in VP5* Hydrophobic Loops on Rotavirus Cell Entry","abstract":"ABSTRACT Experiments in cell-free systems have demonstrated that the VP5* cleavage fragment of the rotavirus spike protein, VP4, undergoes a foldback rearrangement that translocates three clustered hydrophobic loops from one end of the molecule to the other.

Silencing the expression of grp94 and Erp57 had no effect on rotavirus infectivity, while knocking down the expression of any of the other four chaperons caused a reduction in the yield of infectious virus of about 50%. In grp78-silenced cells, the maturation of the oligosaccharide chains of NSP4 was retarded. In cells with reduced levels of calnexin, the oxidative folding of VP7 was impaired and the trimming of NSP4 was accelerated, and in calreticulin-silenced cells, the formation of disulfide bonds of VP7 was also accelerated. The knockdown of PDI impaired the formation and/or rearrangement of the VP7 disulfide bonds. All these conditions also affected the correct assembly of virus particles, since compared with virions from control cells, they showed an altered susceptibility to EGTA and heat treatments, a decreased specific infectivity, and a diminished reactivity to VP7 with monoclonal antibody M60, which recognizes only this protein when its disulfide bonds have been correctly formed.

Recently, we isolated rhesus rotavirus variants, named nar, whose infectivity, like that of human rotaviruses, is not dependent on SA. In this work, we have determined the binding properties of these SA-dependent and -independent rotavirus strains to MA104 cells. The half-time of attachment of the SA-dependent porcine rotavirus YM and reassortant virus DS1xRRV was found to be about 10 times longer in neuraminidase-treated cells than in untreated cells. On the other hand, human rotaviruses Wa and DS1, and the variant nar3, bound to cells two to three times more rapidly in the absence of SA. To investigate whether the SA-independent cellular structure recognized by the variant and human rotaviruses was the same, we used an infection assay designed to detect competition for cell surface molecules at both attachment and post-attachment steps. In this assay, human rotavirus Wa efficiently competed the infectivity of YM in untreated cells and that of the variant nar3 in untreated, as well as neuraminidase-treated, cells. This competition was nonreciprocal, since YM and nar3 did not compete, but rather increased three- to fivefold the infectivity of Wa. In contrast, a two-direction competition between the variant nar3 and DS1xRRV was found. Similar results were obtained when psoralen-inactivated viruses were used as competitors, indicating that the competition observed was during the early stages of infection.

The lack of Golgi network-specific processing of the caveolar NSP4 glycans supports studies showing that NSP4 bypasses the Golgi apparatus. Confocal imaging showed the colocalization of NSP4 with caveolin-1 early and late in infection, elucidating the temporal and spatial NSP4-caveolin-1 association during infection. These data were extended with fluorescent resonance energy transfer analyses that confirmed the NSP4 and caveolin-1 interaction in that the specific fluorescently tagged antibodies were within 10 nm of each other during infection.

The authors also state that “… hyperphosphorylated NSP5 is predominantly present in previously unrecognized cellular fractions that are insoluble in 0.2% SDS.” We were puzzled by the fact that not a single experiment in this paper was performed with the natural protein. In all cases NSP5 was fused with a His6-G, GAL4, or Myc tag, but the conclusions were extended to the behavior of wild-type NSP5 (wtNSP5). Based on previous results showing that the addition of a tag at the amino terminus of NSP5 drastically changes the characteristics of the protein (e.g., viroplasm-like structure formation without NSP2 [4; unpublished results]), we addressed this point by expressing various NSP5 constructs either untagged or N-terminally tagged with the SV5 peptide (3). \n \nAs shown in Fig. ​Fig.1A1A and in agreement with previous results of this group (2, 3), the soluble fraction of wild-type NSP5 and its mutants NSP5a (Ser63, 65, 67Ala) and NSP5-Ser67Ala were little or not phosphorylated, whereas the mutation of Ser67 into aspartic acid (NSP5-S67D) was associated with hyperphosphorylation of NSP5. In contrast, tagging of NSP5 at the N terminus increased hyperphosphorylation of SV5-NSP5 and SV5-NSP5-S67D, whereas the effect on the mutants SV5-NSP5a and SV5-NSP5-S67A was reduced. Analysis of the insoluble fractions showed that the relative amounts of the nontagged NSP5 constructs were less than 10% of the total and did not show a phosphorylation pattern different from that of the soluble fraction (Fig. ​(Fig.1A).1A). By contrast, N-tagged constructs showed a pattern of increased phosphorylation in the insoluble fraction, yet this represented in all cases not more than 20% of the total.

We found, in agreement with our previous results (1), that NSP2 was able to induce hyperphosphorylation of wtNSP5, with identical forms being present in the insoluble fraction but with the amount representing less than 10% (Fig. ​(Fig.1B).1B). Finally, and very importantly, at least 90% of the total amount of wtNSP5 derived from virus-infected cells was present in the soluble fraction (Fig. ​(Fig.1C).1C). Therefore, we can rule out the possibility that lack of analysis of the insoluble fractions could have led to misinterpretation of our previously published data. \n \nOur results clearly show that without the control of the natural protein, the use of tagged-NSP5 constructs can produce spurious and misleading results.

Among the molecules implicated are gangliosides, glycosphingolipids with one or more sialic acid (SA) residues. The role of gangliosides in rotavirus cell entry was studied by silencing the expression of two key enzymes involved in their biosynthesis—the UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), which transfers a glucose molecule to ceramide to produce glucosylceramide GlcCer, and the lactosyl ceramide-α-2,3–sialyl transferase 5 (GM3-s), which adds the first SA to lactoceramide-producing ganglioside GM3. Silencing the expression of both enzymes resulted in decreased ganglioside levels (as judged by GM1a detection). Four rotavirus strains tested (human Wa, simian RRV, porcine TFR-41, and bovine UK) showed a decreased infectivity in cells with impaired ganglioside synthesis; however, their replication after bypassing the entry step was not affected, confirming the importance of gangliosides for cell entry of the viruses. Interestingly, viral binding to the cell surface was not affected in cells with inhibited ganglioside synthesis, but the infectivity of all strains tested was inhibited by preincubation of gangliosides with virus prior to infection.

We tested for NSP4 viroporin activity from divergent strains, including RVA (EC and Ty-1), RVB (IDIR), and RVC (Cowden).

Only mammalian RVA and RVC NSP4s induced BL21-pLysS E. coli cell lysis, a classical viroporin activity assay. In contrast, RVA, RVB, and RVC NSP4 expression was universally cytotoxic to E. coli and disrupted reduction-oxidation activities, as measured by a new redox dye assay. In mammalian cells, RVB and RVC NSP4s were initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked into punctate structures that were mutually exclusive with RVA NSP4. The punctate structures partially localized to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) but primarily colocalized with punctate LC3, a marker for autophagosomes.

This study presents a functional genome-scale analysis of cellular proteins and pathways relevant for RV infection using RNAi. Among the 522 proteins selected in the screen for their ability to affect viral infectivity, an enriched group that participates in endocytic processes was identified. Within these proteins, subunits of the vacuolar ATPase, small GTPases, actinin 4, and, of special interest, components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery were found. Here we provide evidence for a role of the ESCRT complex in the entry of simian and human RV strains in both monkey and human epithelial cells. In addition, the ESCRT-associated ATPase VPS4A and phospholipid lysobisphosphatidic acid, both crucial for the formation of intralumenal vesicles in multivesicular bodies, were also found to be required for cell entry. Interestingly, it seems that regardless of the molecules that rhesus RV and human RV strains use for cell-surface attachment and the distinct endocytic pathway used, all these viruses converge in early endosomes and use multivesicular bodies for cell entry. Furthermore, the small GTPases RHOA and CDC42, which regulate different types of clathrin-independent endocytosis, as well as early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1), were found to be involved in this process.

Two viral particles and four virus-like particles containing various combinations of inner (VP2)-, middle (VP6)-, and outer (VP7)-layer proteins were studied. We observed that the absence of the VP2 layer increases the particle diameter and changes the type of quasi-equivalent icosahedral symmetry, as described by the shift in triangulation number (T) of the VP6 layer (from T = 13 to T = 19 or more). By fitting X-ray models of VP6 into each reconstruction, we determined the quasi-atomic structures of the middle layers. These models showed that the VP6 lattices, i.e., curvature and trimer contacts, are characteristic of the particle composition. The different functional states of VP6 thus appear as being characterized by trimers having similar conformations but establishing different intertrimeric contacts. Remarkably, the external protein VP7 reorients the VP6 trimers located around the fivefold axes of the icosahedral capsid, thereby shrinking the channel through which mRNA exits the transcribing rotavirus particle.

Through in vitro binding assays and saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we found that P[19] could bind mucin cores 2, 4, and 6, as well as type 1 histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). The common sequences of these glycans serve as minimal binding units, while additional residues, such as the A, B, H, and Lewis epitopes of the type 1 HBGAs, can further define the binding outcomes and therefore likely the host ranges for P[19] RVs. This complex binding property of P[19] is shared with the other three P[II] RVs (P[4], P[6], and P[8]) in that all of them recognized the type 1 HBGA precursor, although P[4] and P[8], but not P[6], also bind to mucin cores. Moreover, while essential for P[4] and P[8] binding, the addition of the Lewis epitope blocked P[6] and P[19] binding to type 1 HBGAs.

Here, we sought to (i) delineate the relationships and sites of variation for VP1 and VP2 proteins belonging to the known RVA genotypes and (ii) correlate intergenotypic sequence diversity with functional VP1-VP2 interaction(s) during dsRNA synthesis. Using bioinformatic approaches, we revealed which VP1 and VP2 genotypes encode divergent proteins and identified the positional locations of amino acid changes in the context of known structural domains/subdomains.

Genotype combinations that were incompatible informed the rational design and in vitro testing of chimeric mutant VP1 and VP2 proteins.

In contrast, for the poorly differentiated kidney epithelial MA 104 cells, which have been used extensively to study rotavirus assembly, it has been shown that rotavirus is released by cell lysis. The subsequent discovery that rotavirus particles associate with raft-type membrane microdomains (RTM) in Caco-2 cells provided a simple explanation for rotavirus polarized targeting. However, the results presented here, together with those recently published by another group, demonstrate that rotavirus also associates with RTM in MA 104 cells, thus indicating that a simple interaction of rotavirus with rafts is not sufficient to explain its apical targeting in intestinal cells. In the present study, we explore the possibility that RTM may have distinct physicochemical properties that may account for the differences observed in the rotavirus cell cycle between MA 104 and Caco-2 cells. We show here that VP4 association with rafts is sensitive to cholesterol extraction by methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment in MA 104 cells and insensitive in Caco-2 cells.

In the crystals, a surface cleft on each DS-1 VP8* core binds N-terminal residues from a neighboring molecule. This cleft may function as a ligand binding site during rotavirus replication. We also report an escape mutant analysis, which allows the mapping of heterotypic neutralizing epitopes recognized by human monoclonal antibodies onto the surface of the VP8* core.

The IFN-inducible 2′,5′-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases (OASs) and ribonuclease (RNase) L are components of a potent host antiviral pathway. We previously showed that murine coronavirus (MHV) accessory protein ns2, a 2H phosphoesterase superfamily member, is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves 2-5A, thereby preventing activation of RNase L. The PDE activity of ns2 is required for MHV replication in macrophages and for hepatitis. Here, we show that group A rotavirus (RVA), an important cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide, encodes a similar PDE. The RVA PDE forms the carboxy-terminal domain of the minor core protein VP3 (VP3-CTD) and shares sequence and predicted structural homology with ns2, including two catalytic HxT/S motifs. Bacterially expressed VP3-CTD exhibited 2′,5′-PDE activity, which cleaved 2-5A in vitro. In addition, VP3-CTD expressed transiently in mammalian cells depleted 2-5A levels induced by OAS activation with poly(rI):poly(rC), preventing RNase L activation. In the context of recombinant chimeric MHV expressing inactive ns2, VP3-CTD restored the ability of the virus to replicate efficiently in macrophages or in the livers of infected mice, whereas mutant viruses expressing inactive VP3-CTD (H718A or H798R) were attenuated. In addition, chimeric viruses expressing either active ns2 or VP3-CTD, but not nonfunctional equivalents, were able to protect ribosomal RNA from RNase L–mediated degradation.

In cell culture, RVAs are propagated in culture medium supplemented with the exogenous protease trypsin, which cleaves VP4 and induces the maturation of progeny RVA virions. ABSTRACT Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are representative enteric virus species and major causes of diarrhea in humans and animals. The RVA virion is a triple-layered particle, and the outermost layer consists of the glycoprotein VP7 and spike protein VP4. To increase the infectivity of RVA, VP4 is proteolytically cleaved into VP5* and VP8* subunits by trypsin; these subunits form a rigid spike structure on the virion surface. In this study, we investigated the growth of RVAs in cells transduced with type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), which cleave fusion proteins and promote infection by respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses. We identified TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D as host TTSPs that mediate trypsin-independent and multicycle infection by human and animal RVA strains. In vitro cleavage assays revealed that recombinant TMPRSS11D cleaved RVA VP4. We also found that TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D promote the infectious entry of immature RVA virions, but they could not activate nascent progeny virions in the late phase of infection. This observation differed from the TTSP-mediated activation process of paramyxoviruses, revealing the existence of virus species-specific activation processes in TTSPs. Our study provides new insights into the interaction between RVAs and host factors, and TTSP-transduced cells offer potential advantages for RVA research and development. IMPORTANCE Proteolytic cleavage of the viral VP4 protein is essential for virion maturation and infectivity in group A rotaviruses (RVAs). In cell culture, RVAs are propagated in culture medium supplemented with the exogenous protease trypsin, which cleaves VP4 and induces the maturation of progeny RVA virions. In this study, we demonstrated that the host proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D mediate the trypsin-independent infection and growth of RVAs. Our data revealed that the proteolytic activation of RVAs by TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D occurs at the viral entry step.

Human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures contain multiple intestinal epithelial cell types that comprise the intestinal epithelium (enterocytes and goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells) and are physiologically active based on responses to agonists. We evaluated these nontransformed, three-dimensional HIE cultures as models for pathogenic infections in the small intestine by examining whether HIEs from different regions of the small intestine from different patients are susceptible to human rotavirus (HRV) infection. Little is known about HRVs, as they generally replicate poorly in transformed cell lines, and host range restriction prevents their replication in many animal models, whereas many animal rotaviruses (ARVs) exhibit a broader host range and replicate in mice. Using HRVs, including the Rotarix RV1 vaccine strain, and ARVs, we evaluated host susceptibility, virus production, and cellular responses of HIEs. HRVs infect at higher rates and grow to higher titers than do ARVs. HRVs infect differentiated enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells, and viroplasms and lipid droplets are induced. Heterogeneity in replication was seen in HIEs from different patients. HRV infection and RV enterotoxin treatment of HIEs caused physiological lumenal expansion detected by time-lapse microscopy, recapitulating one of the hallmarks of rotavirus-induced diarrhea. These results demonstrate that HIEs are a novel pathophysiological model that will allow the study of HRV biology, including host restriction, cell type restriction, and virus-induced fluid secretion. IMPORTANCE Our research establishes HIEs as nontransformed cell culture models to understand human intestinal physiology and pathophysiology and the epithelial response, including host restriction of gastrointestinal infections such as HRV infection. HRVs remain a major worldwide cause of diarrhea-associated morbidity and mortality in children ≤5 years of age. Current in vitro models of rotavirus infection rely primarily on the use of animal rotaviruses because HRV growth is limited in most transformed cell lines and animal models. We demonstrate that HIEs are novel, cellularly diverse, and physiologically relevant epithelial cell cultures that recapitulate in vivo properties of HRV infection. HIEs will allow the study of HRV biology, including human host-pathogen and live, attenuated vaccine interactions; host and cell type restriction; virus-induced fluid secretion; cell-cell communication within the epithelium; and the epithelial response to infection in cultures from genetically diverse individuals.

Earlier studies reported that NSP5 is not hyperphosphorylated without NSP2 coexpression or deleting the NSP5 N terminus and that serine 67 is essential for NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. In this report, we show that full-length NSP5 is hyperphosphorylated in the absence of NSP2 or serine 67 and demonstrate that hyperphosphorylated NSP5 is predominantly present in previously unrecognized cellular fractions that are insoluble in 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The last 68 residues of NSP5 are sufficient to direct green fluorescent protein into insoluble fractions and cause green fluorescent protein localization into viroplasm-like structures; however, NSP5 insolubility was intrinsic and did not require NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. When we mutated serine 67 to alanine we found that the NSP5 mutant was both hyperphosphorylated and insoluble, identical to unmodified NSP5, and as a result serine 67 is not required for NSP5 phosphorylation. Interestingly, treating cells with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A permitted the accumulation of soluble hyperphosphorylated NSP5 isoforms. This suggests that soluble NSP5 is constitutively dephosphorylated by cellular phosphatases and demonstrates that hyperphosphorylation does not direct NSP5 insolubility. Collectively these findings indicate that NSP5 hyperphosphorylation and insolubility are completely independent parameters and that analyzing insoluble NSP5 is essential for studies assessing NSP5 phosphorylation.

In mouse fibroblasts, the inability of rotavirus NSP1 to mediate interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) degradation correlates with IFN-dependent restricted replication of the bovine UK strain but not the mouse EW and simian RRV strains. We found that UK NSP1 is unable to degrade IRF3 when expressed in murine NIH 3T3 cells in contrast to the EW and RRV NSP1 proteins. Surprisingly, UK NSP1 expression led to IRF3 degradation in simian COS7 cells, indicating that IRF3 degradation by NSP1 is host cell dependent, a finding further supported using adenovirus-expressed NSP1 from NCDV bovine rotavirus. By expressing heterologous IRF3 proteins in complementary host cells, we found that IRF3 is the minimal host factor constraining NSP1 IRF3-degradative ability. NSP1-mediated IRF3 degradation was enhanced by transfection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in a host cell-specific manner, and in IRF3-dependent positive regulatory domain III reporter assays, NSP1 inhibited IRF3 function in response to pathway activation by dsRNA, TBK-1, IRF3, or constitutively activated IRF3-5D. An interesting observation arising from these experiments is the ability of transiently expressed UK NSP1 to inhibit poly(I:C)-directed IRF3 activity in NIH 3T3 cells in the absence of detectable IRF3 degradation, an unexpected finding since UK virus infection was unable to block IFN secretion, and UK NSP1 expression did not result in suppression of IRF3-directed activation of the pathway. RRV and EW but not UK NSP1 was proteasomally degraded, requiring E1 ligase activity, although NSP1 degradation was not required for IRF3 degradation. Using a chimeric RRV NSP1 protein containing the carboxyl 100 residues derived from UK NSP1, we found that the RRV NSP1 carboxyl 100 residues are critical for its IRF3 inhibition in murine cells but are not essential for NSP1 degradation.

The results revealed that, under saturating concentrations, NSP2 disrupted both DNA-RNA and RNA-RNA duplexes; hence, the protein possesses helix-destabilizing activity. However, unlike typical helicases, NSP2 required neither a divalent cation nor a nucleotide energy source for helix destabilization. Further characterization showed that NSP2 displayed no polarity in destabilizing a partial duplex. In addition, helix destabilization by NSP2 was found to proceed cooperatively and rapidly. The presence of Mg2+ and other divalent cations inhibited by approximately one-half the activity of NSP2, probably due to the increased stability of the duplex substrate brought on by the cations. In contrast, under conditions where NSP2 functions as an NTPase, its helix-destabilizing activity was less sensitive to the presence of Mg2+, suggesting that in the cellular environment the two activities associated with the protein, helix destabilization and NTPase, may function together. Although distinct from typical helicases, the helix-destabilizing activity of NSP2 is quite similar to that of the ςNS protein of reovirus and to the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) involved in double-stranded DNA replication.

Double-layered particles (DLP) derived from the virus by solubilization of VP4 and VP7 are transcriptionally competent and extrude capped mRNA from their vertices. Analysis of the pseudoatomic model of the VP6 layer, obtained by placing the atomic structure of VP6 into electron microscopy reconstructions of the DLP, has identified the regions of the protein involved in interactions with the internal layer. To study the role of VP6 both in the assembly of DLP and in transcription, 13 site-specific substitution mutations of VP6, targeting the contacts between the two inner layers, were constructed and expressed in the baculovirus system. The effects of these mutations on VP6 expression, trimerization, and formation of macromolecular assemblies were investigated. Using either in vitro reconstituted DLP derived from purified viral cores and recombinant VP6 or in vivo self-assembled virus-like particles resulting from the coexpression of VP2 and VP6 in the baculovirus-Sf9 system (VLP2/6), we have identified the amino acids essential for recovery of transcription or assembly. All VP6 mutants formed stable trimers which, like wild-type VP6, assembled into tubular structures. The ability of VP6 to interact with VP2 was examined by several assays, including electron microscopy, coimmunoprecipitation, purification of VLP2/6, and monitoring of the transcriptase activity of reconstituted DLP. Of the 13 VP6 mutants examined, 3 were unable to assemble with VP2 and 3 others partially assembled. These mutants either did not rescue the transcriptase activity of core particles or did so only marginally. Four mutants as well as the wild-type VP6 assembled and transcribed very well. Three mutants assembled well on cores but, surprisingly, did not rescue the transcriptase activity of reconstituted DLP.

The mechanism by which proteolytic cleavage leads to enhanced growth is unknown. Cleavage of VP3 does not alter viral binding to cell monolayers.

Trypsin-activated RRV was internalized with a half-time of 3 to 5 min, while nonactivated virus disappeared from the cell surface with a half-time of 30 to 50 min. In contrast to trypsin-activated RRV, loss of nonactivated RRV from the cell surface did not result in the appearance of infection, as measured by plaque formation. Endocytosis inhibitors (sodium azide, dinitrophenol) and lysosomotropic agents (ammonium chloride, chloroquine) had a limited effect on the entry of infectious virus into cells.

We report the novel observation that, under physiological conditions, KCa values for both RF and SA11 rotaviruses were well above the intracytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations of various cells, which may explain why TLP uncoating takes place within vesicles (possibly endosomes) during the entry process. A correlation between TLP uncoating and cell membrane permeabilization was found, as shown by the release of carboxyfluorescein (CF) from CF-loaded intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles. Conditions stabilizing the virion in the TLP form inhibited CF release, whereas conditions favoring the TLP-to-DLP transformation activated this process. We conclude that membrane permeabilization must be preceded by the loss of the outer-capsid proteins from trypsinized TLP and that physiological ionic strength is required for permeabilization to take place. Finally, the paper develops an alternative explanation for the mechanism of rotavirus entry, compatible with the Ca2+-dependent endocytic pathway. We propose that there must be an iterative process involving tight coupling in time between the lowering of endosomal Ca2+ concentration, virion decapsidation, and membrane permeabilization, which would cause the transcriptionally active DLPs to enter the cytoplasm of cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is concluded that membrane permeabilization must be preceded by the loss of the outer-capsid proteins from trypsinized TLP and that physiological ionic strength is required for permeabilized cells to take place."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":95,"details":{"paperId":"0e38ab8c21aa0ca667a480879c604722af0390c6","externalIds":{"MAG":"2466971356","DOI":"10.1016/j.coviro.2016.05.008","CorpusId":"3415441","PubMed":"27341619"},"title":"Lipid droplets form complexes with viroplasms and are crucial for rotavirus replication.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Chemical compounds decreasing intracellular triglyceride content reduced rotavirus replication in an animal model and should be considered as potential therapeutic agents against disease caused by rotaviruses, flaviviruses and intrACEllular bacteria."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":124,"details":{"paperId":"90f52cbcd6a0feeffed4b83a438cca4aeff09fc2","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2022.02.005","CorpusId":"247151885","PubMed":"35240536"},"title":"Lipid metabolism is involved in the association of rotavirus viroplasms with endoplasmic reticulum membranes.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is reported that lipid metabolism is essential to maintain the production of the infectious virus through a process independent of viroplasm biogenesis, and disruption of the lipogenesis-lipolysis balance dissociates endoplasmic reticulum membranes fromviroplasms, suggesting that lipid metabolic is essential for a continuous flux of lipids to allow the association between viroPLasms and ER membranes."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":246,"details":{"paperId":"e285a2b40e666febac3dafa8915c2d903025362d","externalIds":{"MAG":"2116326239","PubMedCentral":"3709634","DOI":"10.1099/vir.0.049635-0","CorpusId":"14312276","PubMed":"23515026"},"title":"Lipidome analysis of rotavirus-infected cells confirms the close interaction of lipid droplets with viroplasms","abstract":"Rotaviruses (RVs) cause acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children, and are globally distributed.

Electrophoretic analysis of untreated and trypsin-treated rhesus rotavirus (RRV) and simain rotavirus SA11 in the presence and absence of the reducing agent dithioerythritol revealed that VP4 and its cleavage fragments VP5* and VP8* possessed intrachain disulfide bonds.

Electrophoretic examination of truncated species of VP4 and VP4 containing Cys-->Ser mutations synthesized in reticulocyte lysates provided additional evidence that Cys-203 and Cys-216 in VP8* of RRV were linked by a disulfide bridge. VP5* expressed in vitro was able to form a disulfide bond analogous to that in the VP5* fragment of trypsin-treated RRV.

In this study, we characterize VP2 SGs by correlating genetic markers with the immunoreactivity of the SG-specific monoclonal antibody (YO-60). Our results show that VP2 proteins similar in sequence to that of the prototypic human strain Wa are recognized by YO-60, classifying them as VP2 SG-II.

We found that YO-60 binds to a conformationally dependent epitope that includes Wa VP2 residue M328.

One of the nonstructural proteins, NSP4 (encoded by gene 10), is a transmembrane, endoplasmic reticulum-specific glycoprotein. Recently, our laboratory has shown that NSP4 causes diarrhea in 6- to 10-day-old mice by functioning as an enterotoxin. To confirm the role of NSP4 in rotavirus pathogenesis, we sequenced gene 10 from two pairs of virulent and attenuated porcine rotaviruses, the OSU and Gottfried strains.

We next expressed the cloned gene 10 from the OSU virulent (OSU-v) and OSU attenuated (OSU-a) viruses by using the baculovirus expression system and compared the biological activities of the purified proteins. NSP4 from OSU-v virus increased intracellular calcium levels over 10-fold in intestinal cells when added exogenously and 6-fold in insect cells when expressed endogenously, whereas NSP4 from OSU-a virus had little effect.

In this report, employing a large number of methods and deletion and amino acid substitution mutants, we provide evidence for the cooperation between the extreme C terminus and a putative amphipathic α-helix located between aa 73 and 85 (AAH73-85) at the N terminus of ΔN72, a mutant that lacked the N-terminal 72 aa of nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) from Hg18 and SA11. Cooperation between the two termini appears to generate a unique conformational state, specifically recognized by thioflavin T, that promoted efficient multimerization of the oligomer into high-molecular-mass soluble complexes and dramatically enhanced resistance against trypsin digestion, enterotoxin activity of the diarrhea-inducing region (DIR), and double-layered particle-binding activity of the protein. Mutations in either the C terminus, AAH73-85, or the DIR resulted in severely compromised biological functions, suggesting that the properties of NSP4 are subject to modulation by a single and/or overlapping highly sensitive conformational domain that appears to encompass the entire CT.

The binding protein was identified as vp7, an outer capsid glycoprotein and the product of rotavirus gene 9. These studies concluded that vp7 mediated viral attachment to MA104 cells and that the binding of a soluble viral protein to a cell monolayer mirrored the attachment of infectious rotavirus to permissive tissue culture cells. In the process of determining which viral protein adheres to the in vivo target cell in rotavirus infection, the mammalian enterocyte, we found that a similar 35-kilodalton rhesus rotavirus (RRV) protein bound to both MA104 cells and murine enterocytes. However, further analysis of this protein by immunoprecipitation, inhibition of glycosylation, and partial proteolysis showed that it was not the RRV gene 9 product, vp7, but the gene 8 product, NS35. Similar results were obtained by using porcine rotavirus (OSU) and bovine rotavirus (NCDV) strains. Binding studies using the in vitro-expressed products of RRV genes 8 and 9 confirmed these results. Since double-shelled virions inhibited the binding of NS35 to cells, we looked for the presence of this protein in preparations of purified virus. Examination of density gradient-purified virus preparations revealed biochemical and immunological evidence that NS35 copurifies in small amounts with double-shelled virions. Thus, these studies clearly demonstrated that when rotavirus proteins are prepared in a soluble form from infected cells, NS35, and not vp7, binds to the surfaces of MA104 cells and murine enterocytes.

Rotavirus nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) is a virulence factor that inhibits innate host immune responses. NSP1 from some rotaviruses targets host interferon response factors (IRFs), leading to inhibition of type I interferon expression. A few rotaviruses encode an NSP1 that inhibits the NF-κB pathway by targeting β-TrCP, a protein required for IκB degradation and NF-κB activation. Available evidence suggests that these NSP1 properties involve proteosomal degradation of target proteins. We show here that NSP1 from several human rotaviruses and porcine rotavirus CRW-8 inhibits the NF-κB pathway, but cannot degrade IRF3. Furthermore, β-TrCP levels were much reduced in cells infected with these rotaviruses. This provides strong evidence that β-TrCP degradation is required for NF-κB pathway inhibition by NSP1 and demonstrates the relevance of β-TrCP degradation to rotavirus infection. C-terminal regions of NSP1, including a serine-containing motif resembling the β-TrCP recognition motif of IκB, were required for NF-κB inhibition. CRW-8 infection of HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells induced significant levels of IFN-β and CCL5 but not IL-8. This contrasts with monkey rotavirus SA11-4F, whose NSP1 inhibits IRF3 but not NF-κB. Substantial amounts of IL-8 but not IFN-β or CCL5 were secreted from HT-29 cells infected with SA11-4F.

The lysis of cells, the crystallization of the region spanning residues 95 to 146 of NSP4 (NSP495-146) of strain ST3 (ST3:NSP495-146) at acidic pH, and comparative studies of the recombinant purified peptide under different conditions by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and of the crystal structures suggested pH-, Ca2+-, and protein concentration-dependent oligomeric transitions in the peptide. Since the NSP495-146 mutant lacks the N-terminal amphipathic domain (AD) and most of the C-terminal flexible region (FR), to demonstrate that the pentameric transition is not a consequence of the lack of the N- and C-terminal regions, glutaraldehyde cross-linking of the ΔN72 and ΔN94 mutant proteins, which contain or lack the AD, respectively, but possess the complete C-terminal FR, was carried out.

Using rotavirus (RV) as a model, we found that RV nonstructural protein NSP2 has autokinase activity. The cellular kinase CK1α additionally phosphorylates NSP2, triggering NSP2 octamers to form a lattice structure, and is required to build viroplasms. CK1α and viroplasm-specific NSP2 (vNSP2) are essential for RV nonstructural protein NSP5 hyperphosphorylation and association with vNSP2 for viroplasm formation. Protein regulation by phosphorylation is a common biological mechanism, raising the possibility that similar phosphorylation-dependent virus factory assembly mechanisms exist for other viral pathogens. The rotavirus (RV) genome is replicated and packaged into virus progeny in cytoplasmic inclusions called viroplasms, which require interactions between RV nonstructural proteins NSP2 and NSP5. How viroplasms form remains unknown. We previously found two forms of NSP2 in RV-infected cells: a cytoplasmically dispersed dNSP2, which interacts with hypophosphorylated NSP5; and a viroplasm-specific vNSP2, which interacts with hyperphosphorylated NSP5. Other studies report that CK1α, a ubiquitous cellular kinase, hyperphosphorylates NSP5, but requires NSP2 for reasons that are unclear. Here we show that silencing CK1α in cells before RV infection resulted in (i) >90% decrease in RV replication, (ii) disrupted vNSP2 and NSP5 interaction, (iii) dispersion of vNSP2 throughout the cytoplasm, and (iv) reduced vNSP2 protein levels. Together, these data indicate that CK1α directly affects NSP2.

These processes are orchestrated by yet-to-be-understood complex networks of interactions involving nonstructural proteins (NSPs) 2, 5, and 6 and structural proteins (VPs) 1, 2, 3, and 6. The multifunctional enzyme NSP2, an octamer with RNA binding activity, is critical for viroplasm formation with its binding partner, NSP5, and for genome replication/packaging through its interactions with replicating RNA, the viral polymerase VP1, and the inner core protein VP2. Using isothermal calorimetry, biolayer interferometry, and peptide array screening, we examined the interactions between NSP2, VP1, VP2, NSP5, and NSP6. These studies provide the first evidence that NSP2 can directly bind to VP1, VP2, and NSP6, in addition to the previously known binding to NSP5. The interacting sites identified from reciprocal peptide arrays were found to be in close proximity to the RNA template entry and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) exit tunnels of VP1 and near the catalytic cleft and RNA-binding grooves of NSP2; these sites are consistent with the proposed role of NSP2 in facilitating dsRNA synthesis by VP1. Peptide screening of VP2 identified NSP2-binding sites in the regions close to the intersubunit junctions, suggesting that NSP2 binding could be a regulatory mechanism for preventing the premature self-assembly of VP2. The binding sites on NSP2 for NSP6 were found to overlap that of VP1, and the NSP5-binding sites overlap those of VP2 and VP1, suggesting that interaction of these proteins with NSP2 is likely spatially and/or temporally regulated.

We have used in vitro binding experiments to examine whether NS28 serves as a receptor that binds subviral particles and mediates the budding process.

Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants, we shed light on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent viroplasms. ABSTRACT Rotavirus (RV) replicates in round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories, although how they assemble remains unknown. During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this posttranslational modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on virus replication remain obscure. Here, we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse-genetics system. A trans-complementing cell line stably producing NSP5 was used to generate and characterize several recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that an rRV lacking NSP5 was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to further interrogate the function of this posttranslational modification in the assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant strains exhibited impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines expressing either wild-type NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results indicate that NSP5 hyperphosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional viral factories in other RNA viruses.

Transient expression of this protein in uninfected cells has provided evidence for its participation in the formation of electron-dense cytoplasmic structures, known as viroplasms, which are thought to be key structures for the replication of the virus. NSP6 is a protein of unknown function that seems not to be essential for virus replication in cell culture. To study the function of NSP5 in the context of a viral infection, the expression of RRV gene 11 was silenced by RNA interference. Reduction in the synthesis of NSP5, as shown by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays, correlated with a reduction in the number and size of viroplasms and with an altered intracellular distribution of other viroplasm-associated proteins. Silencing of gene 11 also resulted in a reduced synthesis of viral RNA(+) and double-stranded RNA and of all viral proteins, as well as in a decreased production of infectious virus. A similar phenotype was observed when the NSP5 coding gene of the lapine rotavirus strain Alabama was silenced.

The VP4 subunit VP8*, derived from Wa rotavirus, binds the internal N-acetylneuraminic acid on ganglioside GM1. Wa infection is increased by enhanced internal Sia access following terminal Sia removal from main glycan chains with sialidase. The GM1 ligand cholera toxin B (CTB) reduces Wa infectivity. Here, we found sialidase treatment increased cellular GM1 availability and the infectivity of several other human (including RV-3) and animal rotaviruses, typically rendering them susceptible to methyl α-d-N-acetylneuraminide treatment, but did not alter α2β1 usage. CTB reduced the infectivity of these viruses. Aceramido-GM1 inhibited Wa and RV-3 infectivity in untreated and sialidase-treated cells, and GM1 supplementation increased their infectivity, demonstrating the importance of GM1 for infection. Wa recognition of α2β1 and internal Sia were at least partially independent. Rotavirus usage of GM1 was mapped to VP4 using virus reassortants, and RV-3 VP8* bound aceramido-GM1 by saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD NMR). Most rotaviruses recognizing terminal Sia did not use GM1, including RRV. RRV VP8* interacted minimally with aceramido-GM1 by STD NMR. Unusually, TFR-41 rotavirus infectivity depended upon terminal Sia and GM1. Competition of CTB, Sia, and/or aceramido-GM1 with cell binding by VP8* from representative rotaviruses showed that rotavirus Sia and GM1 preferences resulted from VP8*-cell binding. Our major finding is that infection by human rotaviruses of commonly occurring VP4 serotypes involves VP8* binding to cell surface GM1 glycan, typically including the internal N-acetylneuraminic acid. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses, the major cause of severe infantile gastroenteritis, recognize cell surface receptors through virus spike protein VP4. Several animal rotaviruses are known to bind sialic acids at the termini of main carbohydrate chains. Conversely, only a single human rotavirus is known to bind sialic acid. Interestingly, VP4 of this rotavirus bound to sialic acid that forms a branch on the main carbohydrate chain of the GM1 ganglioside. Here, we use several techniques to demonstrate that other human rotaviruses exhibit similar GM1 usage properties. Furthermore, binding by VP4 to cell surface GM1, involving branched sialic acid recognition, is shown to facilitate infection. In contrast, most animal rotaviruses that bind terminal sialic acids did not utilize GM1 for VP4 cell binding or infection.

A trace of infectivity (< 1000 PFU/ml) was always detected in the preparations of ss-particles, while no detectable infectivity (< 5 PFU/ml) was present in the preparations of outer capsid proteins. By mixing soluble outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7 purified from SA11-4F and ss-particles of B223 at acidic pH (5.4), ds-like, transcapsidated particles were obtained. The transcapsidated particles were indistinguishable from genuine ds-particles by negative stain electron microscopy. However, the particles had a density intermediate between that of ds- and ss-particles. Protease-resistance studies revealed that VP7 was assembled onto transcapsidated particles in a resistant (native) form, but VP4 associated with the particles was completely protease sensitive. Viral infectivity was rescued by in vitro transcapsidation as indicated by a 500- to 1000-fold increase over background. The increased infectivity was neutralized by antiserum against SA11 (outer capsid donor), but not by antiserum against B223 (ss-particle donor). The transcapsidated particles formed small plaques like the B223 parent, and all the infectious progeny viruses contained the B223 genome. These results strongly indicate that the observed increase of infectivity was the result of in vitro transcapsidation.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results strongly indicate that the observed increase of infectivity was the result of in vitro transcapsidation, and all the infectious progeny viruses contained the B223 genome."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":328,"details":{"paperId":"17b6a5621801cfce0649e631e6b36584bb1a87fe","externalIds":{"MAG":"2133688983","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.01689-10","CorpusId":"20451728","PubMed":"21147920"},"title":"Residues of the Rotavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Template Entry Tunnel That Mediate RNA Recognition and Genome Replication","abstract":"ABSTRACT To replicate its segmented, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome, the rotavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, VP1, must recognize viral plus-strand RNAs (+RNAs) and guide them into the catalytic center. VP1 binds to the conserved 3′ end of rotavirus +RNAs via both sequence-dependent and sequence-independent contacts. Sequence-dependent contacts permit recognition of viral +RNAs and specify an autoinhibited positioning of the template within the catalytic site. However, the contributions to dsRNA synthesis of sequence-dependent and sequence-independent VP1-RNA interactions remain unclear. To analyze the importance of VP1 residues that interact with +RNA on genome replication, we engineered mutant VP1 proteins and assayed their capacity to synthesize dsRNA in vitro. Our results showed that, individually, mutation of residues that interact specifically with RNA bases did not diminish replication levels. However, simultaneous mutations led to significantly lower levels of dsRNA product, presumably due to impaired recruitment of +RNA templates. In contrast, point mutations of sequence-independent RNA contact residues led to severely diminished replication, likely as a result of improper positioning of templates at the catalytic site. A noteworthy exception was a K419A mutation that enhanced the initiation capacity and product elongation rate of VP1. The specific chemistry of Lys419 and its position at a narrow region of the template entry tunnel appear to contribute to its capacity to moderate replication.

Segment 11 of the rotavirus genome encodes two nonstructural proteins, NSP5 and NSP6. The NSP6 ORF is present in the vast majority of rotavirus strains, and therefore the NSP6 protein would be expected to have a function in viral replication. However, there is no direct evidence of its function or requirement in the viral replication cycle yet. Here, taking advantage of a recently established plasmid-only-based reverse genetics system that allows rescue of recombinant rotaviruses entirely from cloned cDNAs, we generated NSP6-deficient viruses to directly address its significance in the viral replication cycle. Viable recombinant NSP6-deficient viruses could be engineered. Single-step growth curves and plaque formation of the NSP6-deficient viruses confirmed that NSP6 expression is of limited significance for RVA replication in cell culture, although the NSP6 protein seemed to promote efficient virus growth. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is one of the most important pathogens of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. The rotavirus genome, consisting of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, encodes six structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6). Although specific functions have been ascribed to each of the 12 viral proteins, the role of NSP6 in the viral replication cycle remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the NSP6 protein is not essential for viral replication in cell culture by using a recently developed plasmid-only-based reverse genetics system.

In order to better understand the events leading to RV entry, we established a detection system to image input virus by monitoring the rhesus RV (RRV) antigens VP4, VP6, and VP7 at very early times postinfection. We provide evidence that decapsidation occurs directly after cell membrane penetration. We also demonstrate that several VP4 and VP7 conformational changes take place during entry. In particular, we detected, for the first time, the generation of folded-back VP5 in the context of the initiation of infection. Folded-back VP5 appears to be limited to the entry step. We furthermore demonstrate that RRV enters the cell cytoplasm through an endocytosis pathway. The endocytosis hypothesis is supported by the colocalization of RRV antigens with the early endosome markers Rab4 and Rab5. Finally, we provide evidence that the entry process is likely dependent on the endocytic Ca2+ concentration, as bafilomycin A1 treatment as well as an augmentation of the extracellular calcium reservoir using CaEGTA, which both lead to an elevated intraendosomal calcium concentration, resulted in the accumulation of intact virions in the actin network.

Comparison of x-ray structures has revealed significant structural homology between NSP2 and the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotidyl hydrolases, which in turn has suggested the location of the active site for NTP hydrolysis in NSP2. Consistent with the structural predictions, we show here using site-specific mutagenesis and ATP docking simulations that the active site for NTP hydrolysis is localized to residues within a 25-Å-deep cleft between the C- and N-terminal domains of the NSP2 monomer.

Evaluation of the biological importance of the NTPase activity of NSP2 by transient expression in mammalian cells showed that such activity has no impact on the ability of NSP2 to induce the hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 or to interact with NSP5 to form viroplasm-like structures.

The rotavirus proteins VP3, VP4, VP7, NSP1, and NSP4 have all been implicated in strain and species restriction of replication; however, the mechanisms have not been fully determined. Simian (RRV) and bovine (UK) rotaviruses have distinctive replication capacities in mouse extraintestinal organs such as the biliary tract. Using reassortants between UK and RRV, we previously demonstrated that the differential replication of these viruses in mouse embryonic fibroblasts is determined by the respective NSP1 proteins, which differ substantially in their abilities to degrade interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and suppress the type I IFN response. In this study, we used an in vivo model of rotavirus infection of mouse gallbladder with UK × RRV reassortants to study the genetic and mechanistic basis of systemic rotavirus replication. We found that the low-replication phenotype of UK in biliary tissues was conferred by UK VP4 and that the high-replication phenotype of RRV was conferred by RRV VP4 and NSP1.

Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice provide a model for the human disease. Infection of adult NOD mice with rhesus monkey rotavirus (RRV) accelerates diabetes onset, without evidence of pancreatic infection. Rather, RRV spreads to the pancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes where its association with antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells, induces cellular maturation. RRV infection increases levels of the class I major histocompatibility complex on B cells and proinflammatory cytokine expression by T cells at these sites. In autoimmunity-resistant mice and human mononuclear cells from blood, rotavirus-exposed plasmacytoid dendritic cells contribute to bystander polyclonal B cell activation through type I interferon expression. Here we tested the hypothesis that rotavirus induces bystander activation of lymphocytes from NOD mice by provoking dendritic cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. NOD mouse splenocytes were stimulated with rotavirus and assessed for activation by flow cytometry. This stimulation activated antigen-presenting cells and B cells independently of virus strain and replicative ability. Instead, activation depended on virus dose and was prevented by blockade of virus decapsidation, inhibition of endosomal acidification and interference with signaling through Toll-like receptor 7 and the type I interferon receptor. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells were more efficiently activated than conventional dendritic cells by RRV, and contributed to the activation of B and T cells, including islet-autoreactive CD8+ T cells. Thus, a double-stranded RNA virus can induce Toll-like receptor 7 signaling, resulting in lymphocyte activation.

VP5* and VP5* truncations, but not VP4 or VP8*, permeabilized LUVs as measured by fluorescence dequenching of released CF.

In turn, viruses have evolved a wide variety of strategies to hide from, and to directly antagonize, the host innate immune pathways. One of these pathways is the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway. OAS is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to produce 2′-5′ oligoadenylates, which are the activators of RNase L; this enzyme degrades viral and cellular RNAs, restricting viral infection. It has been recently found that the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of rotavirus VP3 has a 2′-5′-phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity that is able to functionally substitute for the PDE activity of the mouse hepatitis virus ns2 protein. This particular phosphodiesterase cleaves the 2′-5′-phosphodiester bond of the oligoadenylates, antagonizing the OAS/RNase L pathway. However, whether this activity of VP3 is relevant during the replication cycle of rotavirus is not known. Here, we demonstrate that after rotavirus infection the OAS/RNase L complex becomes activated; however, the virus is able to control its activity using at least two distinct mechanisms. A virus-cell interaction that occurs during or before rotavirus endocytosis triggers a signal that prevents the early activation of RNase L, while later on the control is taken by the newly synthesized VP3. Cosilencing the expression of VP3 and RNase L in infected cells yields viral infectious particles at levels similar to those obtained in control infected cells, where no genes were silenced, suggesting that the capping activity of VP3 is not essential for the formation of infectious viral particles. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses represent an important cause of severe gastroenteritis in the young of many animal species, including humans. In this work, we have found that the OAS/RNase L pathway is activated during rotavirus infection, but the virus uses two different strategies to prevent the deleterious effects of this innate immune response of the cell. Early during virus entry, the initial interactions of the viral particle with the cell result in the inhibition of RNase L activity during the first hours of the infection. Later on, once viral proteins are synthesized, the phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 degrades the cellular 2′-5′-oligoadenylates, which are potent activators of RNase L, preventing its activation. This work demonstrates that the OAS/RNase L pathway plays an important role during infection and that the phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 is relevant during the replication cycle of the virus.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The OAS/RNase L pathway is activated during rotavirus infection, but the virus uses two different strategies to prevent the deleterious effects of this innate immune response of the cell."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":491,"details":{"paperId":"8fefbc58375c244a64a82e3f88c4084076838b88","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"2999940","MAG":"2130963764","DOI":"10.1128/mBio.00265-10","CorpusId":"9191102","PubMed":"21151776"},"title":"Rotavirus Disrupts Calcium Homeostasis by NSP4 Viroporin Activity","abstract":"ABSTRACT Many viruses alter intracellular calcium homeostasis. The rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane glycoprotein, increases intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis. However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca2+]cyto are unknown. We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release. Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic α-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster. The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity. In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca2+ by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca2+]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells. When [Ca2+]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels. NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus replication and virion assembly.

Rotavirus infection and expression of nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) alone dramatically increase cytosolic calcium, which is essential for replication and assembly of infectious virions.

Mutational analyses identified residues critical for viroporin activity. Viroporin mutants did not elevate the levels of cytoplasmic calcium in mammalian cells and were maintained in the endoplasmic reticulum rather than forming punctate vesicular structures that are critical for virus replication and morphogenesis.

Rotavirus (RV), a member of the Reoviridae family, still majorly accounts for the AGE in children below 5 years of age in India and worldwide. The involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of RV has been suggested to be of the proviral as well as the anti-viral nature. miRNAs that promote the RV pathogenesis are capable of targeting the cellular components to evade the host anti-viral strategies. On the other hand, miRNAs with anti-rotaviral properties are themselves incapacitated during the progression of the infection. The exploitation of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a pro-rotaviral strategy has already been identified. Thus, miRNAs that proficiently target the intermediates of the EMT pathway may serve as anti-viral counterparts in the RV–host interactions. The role of microRNA-29b (miR-29b) in the majority of human cancers has been well demonstrated, but its significance in viral infections is yet to be elaborated. In this study, we have assessed the role of miR-29b in RV-induced EMT and RV replication. Our study on miR-29b provides evidence for the recruitment of RV non-structural protein NSP1 to control the trans-repression of miR-29b in a p53-dependent manner.

ABSTRACT Rotavirus replicates in unique virus-induced cytoplasmic inclusion bodies called viroplasms (VMs), the composition and structure of which have yet to be understood. Based on the analysis of a few proteins, earlier studies reported that rotavirus infection inhibits stress granule (SG) formation and disrupts P bodies (PBs). However, the recent demonstration that rotavirus infection induces cytoplasmic relocalization and colocalization with VMs of several nuclear hnRNPs and AU-rich element-binding proteins (ARE-BPs), which are known components of SGs and PBs, suggested the possibility of rotavirus-induced remodeling of SGs and PBs, prompting us to analyze a large number of the SG and PB components to understand the status of SGs and PBs in rotavirus-infected cells. Here we demonstrate that rotavirus infection induces molecular triage by selective exclusion of a few proteins of SGs (G3BP1 and ZBP1) and PBs (DDX6, EDC4, and Pan3) and sequestration of the remodeled/atypical cellular organelles, containing the majority of their components, in the VM. The punctate SG and PB structures are seen at about 4 h postinfection (hpi), coinciding with the appearance of small VMs, many of which fuse to form mature large VMs with progression of infection. By use of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown and/or ectopic overexpression, the majority of the SG and PB components, except for ADAR1, were observed to inhibit viral protein expression and virus growth. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that VMs are highly complex supramolecular structures and that rotavirus employs a novel strategy of sequestration in the VM and harnessing of the remodeled cellular RNA recycling bins to promote its growth.

In this study, to determine the mechanism responsible for rotavirus-induced F-actin alteration, we investigated the effect of infection on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in Caco-2 cells, since Ca2+ is known to be a determinant factor for actin cytoskeleton regulation. As measured by quin2 fluorescence, viral replication induced a progressive increase in [Ca2+]i from 7 h postinfection, which was shown to be necessary and sufficient for microvillar F-actin disassembly. During the first hours of infection, the increase in [Ca2+]i was related only to an increase in Ca2+ permeability of plasmalemma. At a late stage of infection, [Ca2+]i elevation was due to both extracellular Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release from the intracellular organelles, mainly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We noted that at this time the [Ca2+]i increase was partially related to a phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent mechanism, which probably explains the Ca2+ release from the ER. We also demonstrated for the first time that viral proteins or peptides, released into culture supernatants of rotavirus-infected Caco-2 cells, induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i of uninfected Caco-2 cells, by a PLC-dependent efflux of Ca2+from the ER and by extracellular Ca2+ influx.

Under these restrictive conditions, however, the viral proteins and some cellular proteins are efficiently translated. The phosphorylation of eIF2α was shown to depend on the synthesis of three viral proteins, VP2, NSP2, and NSP5, since in cells in which the expression of any of these three proteins was knocked down by RNA interference, the translation factor was not phosphorylated. The modification of this factor is, however, not needed for the replication of the virus, since mutant cells that produce a nonphosphorylatable eIF2α sustained virus replication as efficiently as wild-type cells. In uninfected cells, the phosphorylation of eIF2α induces the formation of stress granules, aggregates of stalled translation complexes that prevent the translation of mRNAs.

Protein degradation induced by NSP1 is dependent on the proteasome, and the presence of a RING domain near the N terminus has led to the hypothesis that NSP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. To examine this hypothesis, pulldown assays were performed, followed by mass spectrometry to identify components of the host ubiquitination machinery that associate with NSP1. Multiple components of cullin RING ligases (CRLs), which are essential multisubunit ubiquitination complexes, were identified in association with NSP1. The mass spectrometry was validated in both transfected and infected cells to show that the NSP1 proteins from different strains of rotavirus associated with key components of CRL complexes, most notably the cullin scaffolding proteins Cul3 and Cul1. In vitro binding assays using purified proteins confirmed that NSP1 specifically interacted with Cul3 and that the N-terminal region of Cul3 was responsible for binding to NSP1. To test if NSP1 used CRL3 to induce degradation of the target protein IRF3 or β-TrCP, Cul3 levels were knocked down using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach. Unexpectedly, loss of Cul3 did not rescue IRF3 or β-TrCP from degradation in infected cells. The results indicate that, rather than actively using CRL complexes to induce degradation of target proteins required for IFN production, NSP1 may use cullin-containing complexes to prevent another cellular activity.

All IRF proteins share an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD), and IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 contain a similar C-proximal IRF association domain (IAD) that mediates IRF dimerization. An autoinhibitory domain (ID) at the extreme C terminus interacts with the IAD, burying residues necessary for IRF dimerization. Phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in the ID induces charge repulsions that unmask the IAD, enabling IRF dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation. To define the region of IRF proteins targeted for degradation by NSP1, we generated IRF3 and IRF7 truncation mutants and transiently expressed each with simian SA11-4F NSP1. These assays indicated that the IAD represented a necessary and sufficient target for degradation. Because NSP1 did not mediate degradation of truncated forms of the IAD, NSP1 likely requires a structurally intact IAD for recognition and targeting of IRF proteins.

Previously, we demonstrated that homologous RV efficiently inhibits IFN induction in single infected and bystander villous IECs in vivo. Paradoxically, RV also induces significant type I IFN expression in the intestinal hematopoietic cell compartment in a relatively replication-independent manner. This suggests that RV replication and spread in IECs must occur despite exogenous stimulation of the STAT1-mediated IFN signaling pathway. Here we report that RV inhibits IFN-mediated STAT1 tyrosine 701 phosphorylation in human IECs in vitro and identify RV NSP1 as a direct inhibitor of the pathway. Infection of human HT29 IECs with simian (RRV) or porcine (SB1A or OSU) RV strains, which inhibit IFN induction by targeting either IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) or NF-κB, respectively, resulted in similar regulation of IFN secretion. By flow cytometric analysis at early times during infection, neither RRV nor SB1A effectively inhibited the activation of Y701-STAT1 in response to exogenously added IFN. However, at later times during infection, both RV strains efficiently inhibited IFN-mediated STAT1 activation within virus-infected cells, indicating that RV encodes inhibitors of IFN signaling targeting STAT1 phosphorylation. Expression of RV NSP1 in the absence of other viral proteins resulted in blockage of exogenous IFN-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation, and this function was conserved in NSP1 from simian, bovine, and murine RV strains. Analysis of NSP1 determinants responsible for the inhibition of IFN induction and signaling pathways revealed that these determinants are encoded on discrete domains of NSP1. Finally, we observed that at later times during infection with SB1A, there was almost complete inhibition of IFN-mediated Y701-STAT1 in bystander cells staining negative for viral antigen.

By functioning as substrate adaptors of hijacked CRLs, NSP1 causes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of host proteins that are essential for expression of interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene products. The target of most human and porcine rotaviruses is the β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), a regulator of NF-κB activation. β-TrCP recognizes a phosphorylated degron (DSGΦXS) present in the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB); phosphorylation of the IκB degron is mediated by IκB kinase (IKK). Because NSP1 contains a C-terminal IκB-like degron (ILD; DSGXS) that recruits β-TrCP, we investigated whether the NSP1 ILD is similarly activated by phosphorylation and whether this modification is required to trigger the incorporation of NSP1 into CRLs. Based on mutagenesis and phosphatase treatment studies, we found that both serine residues of the NSP1 ILD are phosphorylated, a pattern mimicking phosphorylation of IκB. A three-pronged approach using small-molecule inhibitors, small interfering RNAs, and mutagenesis demonstrated that NSP1 phosphorylation is mediated by the constitutively active casein kinase II (CKII), rather than IKK. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, we found that this modification was essential for NSP1 recruitment of β-TrCP and induced changes involving the NSP1 N-terminal RING motif that allowed formation of Cul3-NSP1 complexes. Taken together, our results indicate a highly regulated stepwise process in the formation of NSP1-Cul3 CRLs that is initiated by CKII phosphorylation of NSP1, followed by NSP1 recruitment of β-TrCP and ending with incorporation of the NSP1–β-TrCP complex into the CRL via interactions dependent on the highly conserved NSP1 RING motif.

A primary mechanism used by the virus to inhibit host innate immune responses is to hijack cellular cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and redirect their targeting activity to the degradation of cellular proteins crucial for interferon expression.

In this study, we show that formation of NSP1 CRLs is a highly regulated stepwise process initiated by CKII phosphorylation of the β-TrCP recognition motif in NSP1.

The primary function of NSP1 is thought to be degradation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) in the cytoplasm to inhibit IFN induction. Here, we report that NSP1 localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus and disrupts promyelocytic (PML) nuclear bodies (NB) in the nucleus during infection. Nuclear localization of NSP1 did not require an intact C terminus, suggesting NSP1 has a novel function in the nucleus independent of degradation of IRFs or β-TrCP. NSP1 expression either led to a reduction in PML NB number or a change in PML NB morphology from sphere-shaped foci to oblong-shaped structures, depending on the virus strain. Additionally, infection was not affected when cells lack PML NB, suggesting that rotavirus does not require PML for replication in highly permissive cell types. PML was not essential for nuclear localization of NSP1, but PML was required for NSP1 nuclear focus formation.

Rotavirus mRNAs are capped but not polyadenylated, instead terminating in a 3′ GACC motif that is recognized by the viral protein NSP3, which competes with PABP for eIF4G binding. Upon rotavirus infection, viral, GACC-tailed mRNAs are efficiently translated, while host poly(A)-tailed mRNA translation is, in contrast, severely impaired. To explore the roles of NSP3 in these two opposing events, the translational capabilities of three capped mRNAs, distinguished by either a GACC, a poly(A), or a non-GACC and nonpoly(A) 3′ end, have been monitored after electroporation of cells expressing all rotavirus proteins (infected cells) or only NSP3 (stably or transiently transfected cells). In infected cells, we found that the magnitudes of translation induction (GACC-tailed mRNA) and translation reduction [poly(A)-tailed mRNA] both depended on the rotavirus strain used but that translation reduction not genetically linked to NSP3. In transfected cells, even a small amount of NSP3 was sufficient to dramatically enhance GACC-tailed mRNA translation and, surprisingly, to slightly favor the translation of both poly(A)- and nonpoly(A)-tailed mRNAs, likely by stabilizing the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction. These data suggest that NSP3 is a translational surrogate of the PABP-poly(A) complex; therefore, it cannot by itself be responsible for inhibiting the translation of host poly(A)-tailed mRNAs upon rotavirus infection. IMPORTANCE To control host cell physiology and to circumvent innate immunity, many viruses have evolved powerful mechanisms aimed at inhibiting host mRNA translation while stimulating translation of their own mRNAs. How rotavirus tackles this challenge is still a matter of debate. Using rotavirus-infected cells, we show that the magnitude of cellular poly(A) mRNA translation differs with respect to rotavirus strains but is not genetically linked to NSP3. Using cells expressing rotavirus NSP3, we show that NSP3 alone not only dramatically enhances rotavirus-like mRNA translation but also enhances poly(A) mRNA translation rather than inhibiting it, likely by stabilizing the eIF4E-eIF4G complex.

NSP4 is also implicated in the pathophysiology of rotavirus-induced diarrhea by acting as an enterotoxin. To mediate enterotoxic effects in vivo, NSP4 must be secreted or released from rotavirus-infected cells in a soluble form; however, previous studies have indicated that NSP4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized within endomembrane compartments in infected cells. In this study, we examined the fate of NSP4 synthesized in Caco-2 cells infected with bovine rotavirus. Our studies reveal that NSP4 is actively secreted into the culture medium, preferentially from the infected-cell apical surface. The secretion of NSP4 is dramatically inhibited by brefeldin A and monensin, suggesting that a Golgi-dependent pathway is involved in release of the protein. In agreement with the proposed involvement of the Golgi apparatus during secretion, secreted NSP4 appears to undergo additional posttranslational modification compared to its cell-associated counterpart and is partially resistant to deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H.

In the present study, we report role of rotavirus nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) in regulating apoptosis by activating prosurvival pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) during early hours of infections (2 to 8 hpi). The NSP1 mutant strain A5-16 induces weak and transient activation of Akt (protein kinase B) and p65 NF-κB compared to the isogenic wild-type strain A5-13 in MA104 or HT29 cells. The weak NF-κB promoter activity or Akt phosphorylation after A5-16 infection could be complemented in cells transfected with plasmid expressing NSP1 after infection with the rotavirus A5-16 strain. In cells either infected with A5-13 or transfected with pcD-NSP1, coimmunoprecipitation of NSP1 with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) was observed, indicating that strong activation of PI3K/Akt could be due to its interaction with NSP1. In addition, after infection with same multiplicity of infection, A5-16 showed reduced number of viral particles compared to the A5-13 strain at the end of the replication cycle. A lower growth rate could be due to weak induction of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB, since the A5-13 strain also showed reduced growth in the presence of PI3K or NF-κB inhibitors. This effect was interferon independent; however, it was partly due to significantly higher caspase-3 activity, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and apoptosis during earlier stages of infection with the NSP1 mutant. Thus, our data suggest that NSP1 positively supports rotavirus growth by suppression of premature apoptosis for improved virus growth after infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data suggest that NSP1 positively supports rotavirus growth by suppression of premature apoptosis for improved virus growth after infection."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":554,"details":{"paperId":"d0d8b17984986fb087f861371be5c745d9aa7a78","externalIds":{"MAG":"1049551937","DOI":"10.7324/JAPS.2015.50723","CorpusId":"34556343"},"title":"Rotavirus Nonstructural Protein 4 (NSP4)-Viral Enterotoxin with Multiple roles in Pathogenesis of Diarrhoea in Children -","abstract":"Nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) of Rotavirus has been designated as the first viral enterotoxin.

It is responsible for increased intracellular calcium levels in the infected cell leading to a cascade of events which involve phospholipase C mediated secretion of Chloride ions. NSP4 also inhibits intestinal disaccharidases and sodium glucose symporter(SGLT1) so that complex sugars are retained resulting in malabsorption. It also alters actin in the villi resulting in their flattening and overall decreased absorptive area. NSP4 is associated with extracellular proteins and is hypothesized to have paracrine effects on neighbouring cells. Recent research has found it to be an activator of enteric nervous system too.

Rotavirus mRNAs lack a poly(A) tail but have instead a consensus sequence at their 3′ ends that is bound by the viral nonstructural protein NSP3, which also interacts with eIF4GI, using the same region employed by PABP. It is widely believed that these interactions lead to the translation of rotaviral mRNAs, impairing at the same time the translation of cellular mRNAs. In this work, the expression of NSP3 in infected cells was knocked down using RNA interference. Unexpectedly, under these conditions the synthesis of viral proteins was not decreased, while the cellular protein synthesis was restored. Also, the yield of viral progeny increased, which correlated with an increased synthesis of viral RNA.

Based on the location of thecis-acting signals and computer modeling of their secondary structure, the ends of the gene 8 or 9 mRNAs are proposed to interact in cis to form a modified panhandle structure that promotes the synthesis of dsRNA. In this structure, the last 11 to 12 nucleotides of the RNA, including the cis-acting signal that is essential for RNA replication, extend as a single-stranded tail from the panhandled region, and the 5′ untranslated region folds to form a stem-loop motif. To understand the importance of the predicted secondary structure in minus-strand synthesis, mutations were introduced into viral RNAs which affected the 3′ tail and the 5′ stem-loop. Analysis of the RNAs with a cell-free replication system showed that, in contrast to mutations which altered the structure of the 5′ stem-loop, mutations which caused complete or near-complete complementarity between the 5′ end and the 3′ tail significantly inhibited (≥10-fold) minus-strand synthesis. Likewise, incubation of wild-type RNAs with oligonucleotides which were complementary to the 3′ tail inhibited replication.

As judged by viral growth curves, rotaviruses with a rearranged genome (r-RV) had no selective growth advantage over the homologous wt-RV. In contrast, r-RV were selected over wt-RV during competitive experiments (i.e mixed infections between r-RV and wt-RV followed by serial passages in cell culture). Moreover, when competitive experiments were performed between a human r-RV and the bovine wt-RV strain RF, which had a clear growth advantage, rearranged segments 7, 11 or both always segregated in viral progenies even when performing mixed infections at an MOI ratio of 1 r-RV to 100 wt-RV. Lastly, bovine reassortant viruses that had inherited a rearranged segment 7 from human r-RV were generated. Although substitution of wt by rearranged segment 7 did not result in any growth advantage, the rearranged segment was selected in the viral progenies resulting from mixed infections by bovine reassortant r-RV and wt-RV, even for an MOI ratio of 1 r-RV to 107 wt-RV. Lack of selective growth advantage of r-RV over wt-RV in cell culture suggests a mechanism of preferential packaging of the rearranged segments over their standard counterparts in the viral progeny.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Lack of selective growth advantage of r-RV over wt-Rv in cell culture suggests a mechanism of preferential packaging of the rearranged segments over their standard counterparts in the viral progeny."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":264,"details":{"paperId":"161cc3258342d3b731652aa2efa41f4d7f79c1e4","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1101/2020.12.18.423429","CorpusId":"229549443"},"title":"Rotavirus Replication Factories Are Complex Ribonucleoprotein Condensates","abstract":"RNA viruses induce formation of subcellular organelles that provide microenvironments conducive to their replication.

The growth and survival of intestinal epithelial cells, the main targets of rotavirus infection, are largely dependent on the interaction of cell surface integrins with the extracellular matrix. In this study, we detected alterations in cellular integrin expression following rotavirus infection, identified the signaling components required, and analyzed the subsequent effects on cell binding to the matrix component collagen. After rotavirus infection of intestinal cells, expression of α2β1 and β2 integrins was up-regulated, whereas that of αVβ3, αVβ5, and α5β1 integrins, if present, was down-regulated. This differential regulation of integrins was reflected at the transcriptional level. It was unrelated to the use of integrins as rotavirus receptors, as both integrin-using and integrin-independent viruses induced integrin regulation. Using pharmacological agents that inhibit kinase activity, integrin regulation was shown to be dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) but independent of the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and ERK1/2, and cyclooxygenase-2. Replication-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was observed following infection of intestinal and nonintestinal cell lines. Rotavirus activation of PI3K was important for regulation of α2β1 expression. Blockade of integrin regulation by PI3K inhibition led to decreased adherence of infected intestinal cells to collagen and a concomitant decrease in virus titer.

An in vitro replication system for RVs in permanent cell lines was developed in 1982 and expanded to replication in intestinal organoids in 2015. However, the details of rotavirus (RV) entry into cells and particle maturation mechanisms at the molecular level remain incompletely understood. Slowing down human RVA replication in cell culture on ice allowed morphological visualization of virus particle entry and the assembly of triple-layered particles (virion). Although RVAs are non-enveloped viruses, after virus attachment to the cell membrane, the virus enters the cell by perforating the plasma membrane by a fusion mechanism involving VP5* of the cleaved VP4 protein, as the alternative virus entry route besides the receptor-mediated endocytosis which is generally accepted. After assembling double-layered particles (DLPs) in viroplasm or cytoplasm, they appear to be connected with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and become coated with outer capsid proteins (VP4 and VP7) in a coating process. The perforation of the ER membrane is caused by an unknown mechanism following interaction between non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) and the inner capsid protein VP6 of the DLPs.

The loss of NSP2 expression inhibited viroplasm formation, genome replication, virion assembly, and synthesis of the other viral proteins. In contrast, the loss of VP7 expression had no effect on genome replication; instead, it inhibited only outer-capsid morphogenesis.

ABSTRACT Rotaviruses (RV) cause acute severe diarrhea in the absence of substantial intestinal inflammation. They are also highly infectious in their homologous host species. The replication capacity of RV in the small bowel is substantially due to its ability to inhibit different types of interferons (IFNs). Here, we found that during RV infection in vitro, both virus-infected and uninfected bystander cells resist STAT1 phosphorylation and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) induction in response to exogenous interferon (IFN). Functionally, cellular transcription in response to stimulation with IFN, but not intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), was inhibited by RV. Further, IFNAR1 stimulation during RV infection significantly repressed a set of virus-induced transcripts. Regulation of IFN signaling in vivo was studied in suckling mice using the highly infectious murine EW RV strain. Kinetic studies indicated that sustained EW RV replication and IFN induction in the small intestine are accompanied by significant decreases in IFN-stimulated transcripts. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated intestinal damage, driven by STAT1-induced inflammation, was also prevented in EW RV-infected mice. Remarkably, by ectopically stimulating either IFNAR1 or IFNGR1 in EW RV-infected mice, we could eliminate several intestinal antiviral and inflammatory transcriptional responses to RV. In contrast to infection with homologous RV, infection with a STAT1-sensitive heterologous RV strain induced IFN-stimulated transcripts, inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal expression of STAT1-pY701. Finally, RV strain-specific STAT1 regulation also likely determines the intestinal activation of multiple caspases. The simian RRV strain, but not murine EW RV, uniquely triggers the cleavage of both extrinsic and intrinsic caspases (caspases 8, 9, and 3) in a STAT1-mediated manner. Collectively, our findings reveal efficient reprograming of multiple IFN receptors toward a negative-feedback mode of signaling, accompanied by suppression of IFN-mediated antiviral, apoptotic, and inflammatory functions, during natural RV intestinal infection.

Using reverse genetics, we constructed for the first time a recombinant RV, rRV/VP4-BAP, harboring a heterologous peptide in the lectin domain (loop K145-G150) of VP4. ABSTRACT Rotavirus (RV) viroplasms are cytosolic inclusions where both virus genome replication and primary steps of virus progeny assembly take place. A stabilized microtubule cytoskeleton and lipid droplets are required for the viroplasm formation, which involves several virus proteins. The viral spike protein VP4 has not previously been shown to have a direct role in viroplasm formation. However, it is involved with virus-cell attachment, endocytic internalization, and virion morphogenesis. Moreover, VP4 interacts with actin cytoskeleton components, mainly in processes involving virus entrance and egress, and thereby may have an indirect role in viroplasm formation. In this study, we used reverse genetics to construct a recombinant RV, rRV/VP4-BAP, that contains a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) in the K145-G150 loop of the VP4 lectin domain, permitting live monitoring. The recombinant virus was replication competent but showed a reduced fitness. We demonstrate that rRV/VP4-BAP infection, as opposed to rRV/wt infection, did not lead to a reorganized actin cytoskeleton as viroplasms formed were insensitive to drugs that depolymerize actin and inhibit myosin. Moreover, wild-type (wt) VP4, but not VP4-BAP, appeared to associate with actin filaments. Similarly, VP4 in coexpression with NSP5 and NSP2 induced a significant increase in the number of viroplasm-like structures. Interestingly, a small peptide mimicking loop K145-G150 rescued the phenotype of rRV/VP4-BAP by increasing its ability to form viroplasms and hence improve virus progeny formation. Collectively, these results provide a direct link between VP4 and the actin cytoskeleton to catalyze viroplasm assembly.

The rRV/VP4-BAP was replication competent but with reduced fitness due to a defect in the ability to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, which affected the efficiency of viroplasm assembly. This defect was rescued by adding a permeable small-peptide mimicking the wild-type VP4 loop K145-G150.

Our experiments revealed that RV can infect and replicate in human EC tumor cells ex vivo and in vitro and are localized to both EC cells and infected enterocytes in the close vicinity of EC cells in the jejunum of infected mice. Purified NSP4, but not purified virus particles, evoked release of 5-HT within 60 minutes and increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a human midgut carcinoid EC cell line (GOT1) and ex vivo in human primary carcinoid EC cells concomitant with the release of 5-HT. Furthermore, NSP4 stimulated a modest production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), but not of cAMP. RV infection in mice induced Fos expression in the NTS, as seen in animals which vomit after administration of chemotherapeutic drugs. The demonstration that RV can stimulate EC cells leads us to propose that RV disease includes participation of 5-HT, EC cells, the enteric nervous system and activation of vagal afferent nerves to brain structures associated with nausea and vomiting.

Analysis of VP1 purified from open cores by glycerol gradient centrifugation verified that VP1 recognizes the 3' end of viral mRNA but also showed that in the absence of other viral proteins, VP1 lacks replicase activity. When reconstituted with VP2-rich portions of the gradient, VP1 stimulated levels of replicase activity severalfold.

A recent study demonstrated that the major human RVs (P[4], P[6], and P[8]) recognize human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). In this study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of RVs and showed further variations of RV interaction with HBGAs. On the basis of the VP8* sequences, RVs are grouped into five P genogroups (P[I] to P[V]), of which P[I], P[IV], and P[V] mainly infect animals, P[II] infects humans, and P[III] infects both animals and humans. The sialic acid-dependent RVs (P[1], P[2], P[3], and P[7]) form a subcluster within P[I], while all three major P genotypes of human RVs (P[4], P[6], and P[8]) are clustered in P[II]. We then characterized three human RVs (P[9], P[14], and P[25]) in P[III] and observed a new pattern of binding to the type A antigen which is distinct from that of the P[II] RVs. The binding was demonstrated by hemagglutination and saliva binding assay using recombinant VP8* and native RVs. Homology modeling and mutagenesis study showed that the locations of the carbohydrate binding interfaces are shared with the sialic acid-dependent RVs, although different amino acids are involved.

Second, NSP1 can induce proteasome-dependent degradation of the ubiquitin ligase complex protein beta-TrCP, resulting in stabilization of I kappaB and concomitant failure of virus to activate NF-kappaB for induction of IFN. Third, rotavirus may sequester NF-kappaB in viroplasms. And fourth, rotavirus can prevent STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation. The predominant mechanism for rotavirus inhibition of the IFN response is likely both rotavirus strain-specific and cell type-specific. The mammalian reoviruses also display strain-specific differences in their modulation of the IFN response. Reovirus activates RIG-I and IPS-1 for phosphorylation of IRF3. Reovirus-induced activation of MDA5 also participates in induction if IFN-beta, perhaps through activation of NF-kappaB.

A leading theory is that virus-infected cells secrete paracrine signaling molecules that dysregulate epithelial cells. Chang-Graham et al. found that rotavirus-infected cells trigger cell-to-cell signaling that manifests as intercellular calcium waves (see the Perspective by Stanifer and Boulant). This signal results from the repeated release of adenosine 5′-diphosphate by rotavirus-infected cells. This release activates receptors on nearby uninfected cells, resulting in a calcium signal. The intercellular calcium waves activate chloride and serotonin secretion, which contributes to diarrhea and vomiting. Blocking this paracrine signal could represent a target for antidiarrheal pharmacotherapy. Science, this issue p. eabc3621; see also p. 909 Rotavirus, responsible for severe diarrhea in children, triggers extracellular release of ADP from infected cells, which dysregulates nearby uninfected cells. INTRODUCTION Rotavirus (RV) causes severe diarrheal disease in children worldwide by broadly dysregulating intestinal homeostasis. The mechanisms of RV diarrhea are multifactorial and still not completely understood. RV infects epithelial enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells at the tip and middle of villi in the small intestine, but not all of the cells susceptible to RV are infected during disease. A hallmark of RV infection is that RV dysregulates host cell calcium signaling pathways to increase cytosolic calcium, which is required for RV replication. RATIONALE A long-held concept in how RV infection causes life-threatening diarrhea—despite a small percentage of infected cells—is that RV-infected cells release potent signaling molecules that can dysregulate neighboring, uninfected cells. Previous studies have found increased levels of signaling molecules during RV infection, such as RV enterotoxin nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandins (PGE2). However, whether signaling molecule(s) spread from infected to uninfected cells is not clear. Examination of the intercellular signaling between infected and uninfected cells during RV infection may provide insights into the pathophysiology of RV and other viral diarrheas. RESULTS In this study, we used long-term live fluorescence calcium imaging throughout RV infection to show that RV-infected cells produce paracrine signals that manifest as intercellular calcium waves (ICWs), an intercellular communication pathway in which increases in cytosolic calcium occur in an expanding circular pattern from a central initiating cell. We observed RV-induced ICWs in both cell lines and human intestinal enteroids (HIEs). Blocking previously known RV-induced paracrine signaling pathways (enterotoxin NSP4, NO, and PGE2) did not inhibit the ICWs, but the addition of apyrase, an enzyme that degrades extracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP), greatly reduced the ICWs. The RV-induced ICWs were mediated by extracellular ADP, which activates P2Y1 purinergic receptors on neighboring cells. ICWs were blocked by P2Y1 antagonists or CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of the P2Y1 receptor. Inhibiting the paracrine ADP signal reduced RV replication and inhibited the RV-induced increases in COX2 and iNOS expression that mediate PGE2 and NO production, respectively. Blocking ADP signaling also decreased RV-induced serotonin release from HIEs and fluid secretion in an HIE swelling assay. Furthermore, BPTU and MRS2500, small molecule inhibitors of the P2Y1 receptor, reduced RV diarrhea severity in neonatal mice. CONCLUSION The current concept of RV pathogenesis proposes that paracrine signaling from RV-infected cells dysregulates surrounding uninfected cells and contributes to life-threatening diarrhea. Here, characterization of ICWs originating from RV-infected cells has provided direct experimental proof for the role of virus-induced paracrine signaling in gastrointestinal pathophysiology. Furthermore, ADP signaling provides both a potent paracrine signal and the most dominant calcium signal observed in RV infection. These results point to purinergic signaling as a therapeutic target for developing antidiarrheal drugs for RV and potentially other viral diarrheas. Our studies provide direct evidence that viruses can exploit purinergic signaling and intercellular calcium waves to potentially amplify pathophysiological signaling that is important for disease. ADP released from rotavirus-infected cells drives pathogenesis. (Top) Rotavirus-infected intestinal epithelial cells release ADP, which diffuses to neighboring, uninfected cells. (Middle) ADP activates the purinergic P2Y1 receptor, which increases intracellular calcium, observed as an intercellular calcium wave (see filmstrip, right). (Bottom) ADP and P2Y1 activation triggers the release of inflammatory mediators, fluid secretion contributing to diarrhea, and the release of serotonin from enteroendocrine cells to activate the enteric nervous system (ENS). Rotavirus causes severe diarrheal disease in children by broadly dysregulating intestinal homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanism(s) of rotavirus-induced dysregulation remains unclear. We found that rotavirus-infected cells produce paracrine signals that manifested as intercellular calcium waves (ICWs), observed in cell lines and human intestinal enteroids. Rotavirus ICWs were caused by the release of extracellular adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) that activated P2Y1 purinergic receptors on neighboring cells. ICWs were blocked by P2Y1 antagonists or CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of the P2Y1 receptor. Blocking the ADP signal reduced rotavirus replication, inhibited rotavirus-induced serotonin release and fluid secretion, and reduced diarrhea severity in neonatal mice. Thus, rotavirus exploited paracrine purinergic signaling to generate ICWs that amplified the dysregulation of host cells and altered gastrointestinal physiology to cause diarrhea.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study used long-term live fluorescence calcium imaging throughout RV infection to show that RV-infected cells produce paracrine signals that manifest as intercellular calcium waves (ICWs), an inter cellular communication pathway in which increases in cytosolic calcium occur in an expanding circular pattern from a central initiating cell."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":197,"details":{"paperId":"c9c1b61c2ee0c62ec0addf63078d6be30b4aefda","externalIds":{"MAG":"3024782071","DOI":"10.1080/19490976.2020.1754714","CorpusId":"218635009","PubMed":"32404017"},"title":"Rotavirus infection induces glycan availability to promote ileum-specific changes in the microbiome aiding rotavirus virulence","abstract":"ABSTRACT Multiple studies have identified changes within the gut microbiome in response to diarrheal-inducing bacterial pathogens. However, examination of the microbiome in response to viral pathogens remains understudied. Compounding this, many studies use fecal samples to assess microbiome composition; which may not accurately mirror changes within the small intestine, the primary site for most enteric virus infections. As a result, the functional significance of small intestinal microbiome shifts during infection is not well defined. To address these gaps, rotavirus-infected neonatal mice were examined for changes in bacterial community dynamics, host gene expression, and tissue recovery during infection. Profiling bacterial communities using 16S rRNA sequencing suggested significant and distinct changes in ileal communities in response to rotavirus infection, with no significant changes for other gastrointestinal (GI) compartments. At 1-d post-infection, we observed a loss in Lactobacillus species from the ileum, but an increase in Bacteroides and Akkermansia, both of which exhibit mucin-digesting capabilities. Concomitant with the bacterial community shifts, we observed a loss of mucin-filled goblet cells in the small intestine at d 1, with recovery occurring by d 3. Rotavirus infection of mucin-producing cell lines and human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) stimulated release of stored mucin granules, similar to in vivo findings. In vitro, incubation of mucins with Bacteroides or Akkermansia members resulted in significant glycan degradation, which altered the binding capacity of rotavirus in silico and in vitro.

We showed previously that rotaviruses block gene expression induced by type I and II IFNs, through a mechanism allowing activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2 but preventing their nuclear accumulation. This normally occurs through activated STAT1/2 dimerization, enabling an interaction with importin α5 that mediates transport into the nucleus. In rotavirus-infected cells, STAT1/2 inhibition may limit the antiviral actions of IFN produced early in infection. Here we further analysed the block to STAT1/2 nuclear accumulation, showing that activated STAT1 accumulates in the cytoplasm in rotavirus-infected cells. STAT1/2 nuclear accumulation was inhibited by rotavirus even in the presence of the nuclear export inhibitor Leptomycin B, demonstrating that enhanced nuclear export is not involved in STAT1/2 cytoplasmic retention. The ability to inhibit STAT nuclear translocation was completely conserved amongst the group A rotaviruses tested, including a divergent avian strain. Analysis of mutant rotaviruses indicated that residues after amino acid 47 of NSP1 are dispensable for STAT inhibition. Furthermore, expression of any of the 12 Rhesus monkey rotavirus proteins did not inhibit IFN-stimulated STAT1 nuclear translocation. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments from transfected epithelial cells showed that STAT1/2 binds importin α5 normally following rotavirus infection.

Vesicles were charged with high (quenching) concentrations of either carboxyfluorescein or calcein, and the rate of fluorophore release (dequenching) was monitored as a function of time after mixing with purified virus particles. Purified single-shelled particles and untrypsinized double-shelled ones had no effect. Trypsinized double-shelled virions induced carboxyfluorescein release according to sigmoid curves whose lag period and amplitude were a function of virus concentration and depended on both temperature and pH. The presence of 100 mM salts (Tris Cl, NaCl, or KCl) was required, since there was no reaction in isoosmotic salt-free sorbitol media. Other membrane vesicle preparations such as apical membranes of piglet enterocyte and rat placenta syncytiotrophoblasts, basolateral membranes of pig enterocytes, and the undifferentiated plasma membrane of cultured MA104 cells all gave qualitatively similar responses. Inhibition by a specific monoclonal antibody suggests that the active species causing carboxyfluorescein release is VP5*. Ca2+ (1 mM), but not Mg2+, inhibited the reaction. In situ solubilization of the outer capsid of trypsinized double-shelled particles changed release kinetics from sigmoidal to hyperbolic and was not inhibited by Ca2+. Our results indicate that membrane destabilization caused by trypsinized outer capsid proteins of rotavirus leads to fluorophore release.

In this study, we determined that the rotavirus gene 5 product, nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), interacts with IRF3 in the infected cell. To understand the importance of the interaction, we compared IRF3 activation by rotaviruses expressing wild-type and C-truncated forms of NSP1. The analysis showed that IRF3 underwent dimerization and nuclear translocation and stimulated IFN promoter activity in infected cells expressing truncated NSP1. In contrast, infected cells expressing wild-type NSP1 were characterized by the rapid degradation of IRF3 during the replication cycle, severe decreases in IRF3 dimerization and nuclear translocation, and lack of IFN promoter activity. The implication of these results, that wild-type NSP1 is an antagonist of the IFN-signaling pathway, was confirmed in transient expression assays, which showed that wild-type NSP1, but not the C-truncated protein, induced the degradation of IRF3 fusion proteins. Related experiments indicated that NSP1 mediates IRF3 degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway. The critical role of NSP1 in promoting cell-to-cell spread of rotavirus was demonstrated by using gene 5-specific short interfering RNAs in plaque assays.

In this study, we examined the structure of RNA caps made by open cores and have analyzed open cores for other capping-related enzymatic activities.

Enzymatic analysis indicated that the GppppG caps resulted from the lack of a functional RNA 5'-triphosphatase in open cores, to remove the gamma-phosphate from the RNA prior to capping. RNA 5'-triphosphatases commonly exhibit an associated nucleoside triphosphatase activity, and this too was not detected in open cores.

These vesicles have been shown to contain markers of exosomes; however, in a recent work they presented characteristics more typical of microparticles, and they were associated with an increase in the infectivity of the virus. In this work, we purified different types of vesicles from rotavirus-infected cells.

We confirmed a non-lytic rotavirus release from the two cell lines tested, and observed a notable stimulation of vesicle secretion following rotavirus infection. A fraction of the secreted viral particles present in the cell supernatant was protected from protease treatment, possibly through its association with membranous vesicles; the more pronounced association of the virus was with fractions corresponding to cell membrane generated microvesicles.

Bovine rotavirus (BRV) UK uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while rhesus rotavirus (RRV) employs an endocytic process independent of clathrin and caveolin. Given the differences in the cell internalization pathway used by these viruses, we tested if the intracellular trafficking of BRV UK was the same as that of RRV, which is known to reach maturing endosomes (MEs) to infect the cell. We found that BRV UK also reaches MEs, since its infectivity depends on the function of Rab5, the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), and the formation of endosomal intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). However, unlike RRV, the infectivity of BRV UK was inhibited by knocking down the expression of Rab7, indicating that it has to traffic to late endosomes (LEs) to infect the cell. The requirement for Rab7 was also shared by other RV strains of human and porcine origin. Of interest, most RV strains that reach LEs were also found to depend on the activities of Rab9, the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-M6PR), and cathepsins B, L, and S, suggesting that cellular factors from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) need to be transported by the CD-M6PR to LEs to facilitate RV cell infection. Furthermore, using a collection of UK × RRV reassortant viruses, we found that the dependence of BRV UK on Rab7, Rab9, and CD-M6PR is associated with the spike protein VP4. These findings illustrate the elaborate pathway of RV entry and reveal a new process (Rab9/CD-M6PR/cathepsins) that could be targeted for drug intervention. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is an important etiological agent of severe gastroenteritis in children. In most instances, viruses enter cells through an endocytic pathway that delivers the viral particle to vesicular organelles known as early endosomes (EEs). Some viruses reach the cytoplasm from EEs, where they start to replicate their genome. However, other viruses go deeper into the cell, trafficking from EEs to late endosomes (LEs) to disassemble and reach the cytoplasm. In this work, we show that most RV strains have to traffic to LEs, and the transport of endolysosomal proteases from the Golgi complex to LEs, mediated by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, is necessary for the virus to exit the vesicular compartment and efficiently start viral replication. We also show that this deep journey into the cell is associated with the virus spike protein VP4.

The VP5* protein contains a single long hydrophobic domain (VP5*-HD, residues 385 to 404) at an internal site. In order to address the role of the VP5*-HD in permeabilizing cellular membranes, we analyzed the entry ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) into cells induced to express VP5* or mutated VP5* polypeptides. Following IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) induction, VP5* and VP5* truncations containing the VP5*-HD permeabilized cells to the entry and cleavage of ONPG, while VP8* and control proteins had no effect on cellular permeability. Expression of VP5* deletions containing residues 265 to 474 or 265 to 404 permeabilized cells; however, C-terminal truncations which remove the conserved GGA (residues 399 to 401) within the HD abolished membrane permeability. Site-directed mutagenesis of the VP5-HD further demonstrated a requirement for residues within the HD for VP5*-induced membrane permeability. Functional analysis of mutant VP5*s indicate that conserved glycines within the HD are required and suggest that a random coiled structure rather than the strictly hydrophobic character of the domain is required for permeability.

In microtubule depolymerization areas, tubulin granules are observed; they colocalize with viroplasms, viral compartments formed by interactions between rotavirus proteins NSP2 and NSP5. With purified proteins, we show that tubulin directly interacts in vitro with NSP2 but not with NSP5. The binding of NSP2 to tubulin is independent of its phosphatase activity. The comparison of three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of NSP2 octamers alone or associated with tubulin reveals electron densities in the positively charged grooves of NSP2 that we attribute to tubulin. Site-directed mutagenesis of NSP2 and competition assays between RNA and tubulin for NSP2 binding confirm that tubulin binds to these charged grooves of NSP2. Although the tubulin position within NSP2 grooves cannot be precisely determined, the tubulin C-terminal H12 α-helix could be involved in the interaction. NSP2 overexpression and rotavirus infection produce similar effects on the microtubule network. NSP2 depolymerizes microtubules and leads to tubulin granule formation.

To address this possibility, we contrasted the sequences, structures, and functions of RdRps belonging to RV groups A, B, and C (A-VP1, B-VP1, and C-VP1, respectively).

Various lines of evidence suggest that the nonstructural glycoprotein NSP4 and possibly the major outer capsid glycoprotein VP7 are responsible for these effects. In order to evaluate the functional roles of NSP4 and other rotavirus proteins in the changes in Ca2+ homeostasis observed in infected cells, the expressions of NSP4, VP7, and VP4 were silenced using the short interfering RNA (siRNA) technique. The transfection of specific siRNAs resulted in a strong and specific reduction of the expression of NSP4, VP7, and VP4 and decreased the yield of new viral progeny by more than 90%.

The outer layer proteins, VP4 (cleaved to VP8* and VP5*) and VP7, surround a transcriptionally competent, double-layer particle (DLP), which they deliver into the cytosol. During entry of rhesus rotavirus, VP8* interacts with cell surface gangliosides, allowing engulfment into a membrane vesicle by a clathrin-independent process. Escape into the cytosol and outer-layer shedding depend on interaction of a hydrophobic surface on VP5* with the membrane bilayer and on a large-scale conformational change. We report here experiments that detect the fate of released DLPs and their efficiency in initiating RNA synthesis. By replacing the outer layer with fluorescently tagged, recombinant proteins and also tagging the DLP, we distinguished particles that have lost their outer layer and entered the cytosol (uncoated) from those still within membrane vesicles. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization with probes for nascent transcripts to determine how soon after uncoating transcription began and what fraction of the uncoated particles were active in initiating RNA synthesis. We detected RNA synthesis by uncoated particles as early as 15 min after adding virus. The uncoating efficiency was 20 to 50%; of the uncoated particles, about 10 to 15% synthesized detectable RNA. In the format of our experiments, about 10% of the added particles attached to the cell surface, giving an overall ratio of added particles to RNA-synthesizing particles of between 250:1 and 500:1, in good agreement with the ratio of particles to focus-forming units determined by infectivity assays. Thus, RNA synthesis by even a single, uncoated particle can initiate infection in a cell. IMPORTANCE The pathways by which a virus enters a cell transform its packaged genome into an active one. Contemporary fluorescence microscopy can detect individual virus particles as they enter cells, allowing us to map their multistep entry pathways. Rotaviruses, like most viruses that lack membranes of their own, disrupt or perforate the intracellular, membrane-enclosed compartment into which they become engulfed following attachment to a cell surface, in order to gain access to the cell interior. The properties of rotavirus particles make it possible to determine molecular mechanisms for these entry steps. In the work described here, we have asked the following question: what fraction of the rotavirus particles that penetrate into the cell make new viral RNA?

VP7 and NSP4 are two glycosylated proteins.

In this study, we used tunicamycin (TM), a drug known to block the first step of protein N glycosylation, as a tool to dissect rotavirus assembly. We show that, as expected, TM blocks viral protein glycosylation and also decreases virus infectivity. In the meantime, viral particles were blocked as enveloped particles in the ER. Interestingly, TM does not prevent the targeting of VP4 to the cell surface nor its association with raft membranes, whereas the infectivity associated with the raft fractions strongly decreased. VP4 does not colocalize with the ER marker protein disulfide-isomerase even when viral particles were blocked by TM in this compartment.

The preference of animal rotaviruses for these natural N-acylneuraminic acids has not been comprehensively established, and detailed structural information regarding the interactions of different rotaviruses with N-glycolylneuraminic acids is lacking.

Although its native oligomeric state is unclear, crystallographic studies of the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of NSP4 from two different strains suggest that it functions as a tetramer or a pentamer. While the CCD of simian strain SA11 NSP4 forms a tetramer that binds Ca2+ at its core, the CCD of human strain ST3 forms a pentamer lacking the bound Ca2+ despite the residues (E120 and Q123) that coordinate Ca2+ binding being conserved. In these previous studies, while the tetramer crystallized at neutral pH, the pentamer crystallized at low pH, suggesting that preference for a particular oligomeric state is pH dependent and that pH could influence Ca2+ binding. Here, we sought to examine if the CCD of NSP4 from a single RV strain can exist in two oligomeric states regulated by Ca2+ or pH. Biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic studies show that while the CCD of SA11 NSP4 exhibits high-affinity binding to Ca2+ at neutral pH and forms a tetramer, it does not bind Ca2+ at low pH and forms a pentamer, and the transition from tetramer to pentamer is reversible with pH. Mutational analysis shows that Ca2+ binding is necessary for the tetramer formation, as an E120A mutant forms a pentamer. We propose that the structural plasticity of NSP4 regulated by pH and Ca2+ may form a basis for its pleiotropic functions during RV replication. IMPORTANCE The nonstructural protein NSP4 of rotavirus is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in virus replication, morphogenesis, and pathogenesis. Previous crystallography studies of the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of NSP4 from two different rotavirus strains showed two distinct oligomeric states, a Ca2+-bound tetrameric state and a Ca2+-free pentameric state. Whether NSP4 CCD from the same strain can exist in different oligomeric states and what factors might regulate its oligomeric preferences are not known. This study used a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and crystallography techniques and found that the NSP4 CCD can undergo a reversible transition from a Ca2+-bound tetramer to a Ca2+-free pentamer in response to changes in pH. From these studies, we hypothesize that this remarkable structural adaptability of the CCD forms a basis for the pleiotropic functional properties of NSP4.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The NSP4 CCD can undergo a reversible transition from a Ca2+-bound tetramer to a Ca1+-free pentamer in response to changes in pH, and this remarkable structural adaptability of the CCD forms a basis for the pleiotropic functional properties of NSP 4."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":185,"details":{"paperId":"3fb2e1bb68208d9a0a159fe9911f330816a23b15","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8521686","MAG":"3093572721","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2100198118","CorpusId":"226228735","PubMed":"34615715"},"title":"Structural basis of rotavirus RNA chaperone displacement and RNA annealing","abstract":"Significance Accurate RNA folding is essential for virus replication. Rotaviruses are viruses infecting humans and animals. Rotavirus genome comprises 11 distinct RNAs, and successful replication requires the incorporation of all 11 RNAs into a virion. The RNA chaperone NSP2 binds viral transcripts, regulating their interactions with each other. NSP2 must release RNAs after they base pair prior to their packaging. Using single-molecule fluorescence tools, we dissected the individual steps of the RNA chaperone activity of NSP2. Structural proteomics and cryo-EM studies of the NSP2–RNA complex revealed that NSP2 regulates RNA unfolding and the release of the RNA using its charged C-terminal region. Some aspects of the viral RNA chaperone regulation mirror the conserved autoregulation mechanisms employed by bacterial RNA chaperones. Rotavirus genomes are distributed between 11 distinct RNA molecules, all of which must be selectively copackaged during virus assembly. This likely occurs through sequence-specific RNA interactions facilitated by the RNA chaperone NSP2. Here, we report that NSP2 autoregulates its chaperone activity through its C-terminal region (CTR) that promotes RNA–RNA interactions by limiting its helix-unwinding activity. Unexpectedly, structural proteomics data revealed that the CTR does not directly interact with RNA, while accelerating RNA release from NSP2. Cryo–electron microscopy reconstructions of an NSP2–RNA complex reveal a highly conserved acidic patch on the CTR, which is poised toward the bound RNA. Virus replication was abrogated by charge-disrupting mutations within the acidic patch but completely restored by charge-preserving mutations. Mechanistic similarities between NSP2 and the unrelated bacterial RNA chaperone Hfq suggest that accelerating RNA dissociation while promoting intermolecular RNA interactions may be a widespread strategy of RNA chaperone recycling.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"NSP2 autoregulates its chaperone activity through its C-terminal region (CTR) that promotes RNA–RNA interactions by limiting its helix-unwinding activity, suggesting that accelerating RNA dissociation while promoting intermolecular RNA interactions may be a widespread strategy of RNA chaperones recycling."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":164,"details":{"paperId":"d9f0b9c72004700631f1a179d58fc4a66fde4fc8","externalIds":{"MAG":"1985178009","DOI":"10.1038/nrmicro2673","CorpusId":"23334776","PubMed":"22266782"},"title":"Structural insights into the coupling of virion assembly and rotavirus replication","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This Review explores the current understanding of rotavirus replication and how it compares to replication of other Reoviridae family members."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":102,"details":{"paperId":"9281199c6e8b193a2080923bae29f48ec11a68c5","externalIds":{"MAG":"2001383679","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmb.2011.08.008","CorpusId":"25714054","PubMed":"21864538"},"title":"Structural organisation of the rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP5.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The NSP5 model suggests that steric hindrance prevents NSP2 from binding to all N SP5 protomers, and some protomers may be free to interact with other NSP 5 binding partners, such as viral RNAs and the viral polymerase VP1, to perform functions other than viroplasm organisation."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":207,"details":{"paperId":"608870bb1b60f4bb02d8d8a91a0a1319be3b4ded","externalIds":{"MAG":"2075656541","DOI":"10.1093/emboj/20.7.1498","CorpusId":"25441589","PubMed":"11285214"},"title":"Structural polymorphism of the major capsid protein of rotavirus","abstract":"Rotaviruses are important human pathogens with a triple‐layered icosahedral capsid.

D. Rolsma, H. B. Gelberg, and M. S. Kuhlenschmidt, J. Virol. 68:258–268, 1994), was further purified and found to contain two major monosialogangliosides. Each ganglioside was purified to apparent homogeneity, and their carbohydrate structure was examined by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection and fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy. Both gangliosides possessed a sialyllactose oligosaccharide moiety characteristic of GM3gangliosides. Compositional analyses indicated that each ganglioside was composed of sialic acid, galactose, glucose, and sphingosine in approximately a 1:1:1:1 molar ratio. Each ganglioside differed, however, in the type of sialic acid residue it contained. AnN-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) moiety was found in the more polar porcine GM3, whereas the less polar GM3 species contained N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc). Both NeuGcGM3 and NeuAcGM3 displayed dose-dependent inhibition of virus binding to host cells. NeuGcGM3 was approximately two to three times more effective than NeuAcGM3 in blocking virus binding. Inhibition of binding occurred with as little as 400 pmol of NeuGcGM3/50 ng of virus (∼2 × 107virions) and 2 × 106 cells/ml. Fifty percent inhibition of binding was achieved with 0.64 and 1.5 μM NeuGcGM3 and NeuAcGM3, respectively. The free oligosaccharides 3′- and 6′-sialyllactose inhibited binding 50% at millimolar concentrations, which were nearly 1,000 times the concentration of intact gangliosides required for the same degree of inhibition. Direct binding of infectious, triple-layer rotavirus particles, but not noninfectious, double-layered rotavirus particles, to NeuGcGM3 and NeuAcGM3 was demonstrated by using a thin-layer chromatographic overlay assay. NeuGcGM3and NeuAcGM3 inhibited virus infectivity of MA-104 cells by 50% at concentrations of 3.97 and 9.84 μM, respectively. NeuGcGM3 (700 nmol/g [dry weight] of intestine) was found to be the predominant enterocyte ganglioside (comprising 75% of the total lipid-bound sialic acid) in neonatal piglets, followed by NeuAcGM3 (200 nmol/g [dry weight] of intestine). NeuGcGM3 and NeuAcGM3 together comprised nearly 100% of the lipid-bound sialic acid in the neonatal intestine, but their quantities rapidly diminished during the first 5 weeks of life. These data support the hypothesis that porcine NeuGcGM3 and NeuAcGM3 are physiologically relevant receptors for porcine rotavirus (OSU strain). Further support for this hypothesis was obtained from virus binding studies using mutant or neuraminidase-treated cell lines. Lec-2 cells, a mutant clone of CHO cells characterized by a 90% reduction in sialyllation of its glycoconjugates, bound less than 5% of the virus compared to control cell binding. In contrast, Lec-1 cells, a mutant CHO clone characterized by a deficiency in glycosylation of N-linked oligosaccharides, still bound rotavirus. Furthermore, exogenous addition of NeuGcGM3 to the Lec-2 mutant cells restored their ability to bind rotavirus in amounts equivalent to that of their parent (CHO) cell line. In the virus-permissive MA-104 cell line, NeuGcGM3 was also able to partially restore rotavirus infectivity in neuraminidase-treated cells.

Here, we have analyzed the requirements for template recognition by the rotavirus RdRP and compared those to the requirements for formation of (–) strand initiation complexes.

Although the RdRP alone can specifically bind to viral mRNAs, our analysis reveals that this interaction is not sufficient to generate initiation complexes, even in the presence of nucleotides and divalent cations. Rather, the formation of initiation complexes also requires the core lattice protein (VP2), a virion component that forms a T = 1 icosahedral shell that encapsidates the segmented dsRNA genome.

ABSTRACT The interactions between viruses and actin cytoskeleton have been widely studied. We showed that rotaviruses remodel microfilaments in intestinal cells and demonstrated that this was due to the VP4 spike protein. Microfilaments mainly occur in the apical domain of infected polarized enterocytes and favor the polarized apical exit of viral progeny. The present work aims at the identification of molecular determinants of actin-VP4 interactions. We used various deletion mutants of VP4 that were transfected into Cos-7 cells and analyzed interactions by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. It has been established that the C-terminal part of VP4 is embedded within viral particles when rotavirus assembles. The use of specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that VP4 is expressed in different forms in infected cells: classically as spike on the outer layer of virus particles, but also as free soluble protein in the cytosol. The C terminus of free VP4 was identified as interacting with actin microfilaments. The VP4 actin binding domain is unable to promote microfilament remodeling by itself; the coiled-coil domain is also required in this process. This actin-binding domain was shown to dominate a previously identified peroxisomal targeting signal, located in the three last amino acids of VP4. The newly identified actin-binding domain is highly conserved in rotavirus strains from species A, B, and C, suggesting that actin binding and remodeling is a general strategy for rotavirus exit. This provides a novel mechanism of protein-protein interactions, not involving cell signaling pathways, to facilitate rotavirus exit.

In this report, we have defined signals within the C-terminal 21 amino acids of NSP5 that are required for VLS formation and that direct the insolubility and hyperphosphorylation of NSP5. Deleting C-terminal residues of NSP5 dramatically increased the solubility of N-terminally tagged NSP5 and prevented NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. Computer modeling and analysis of the NSP5 C terminus revealed the presence of an amphipathic α-helix spanning 21 C-terminal residues that is conserved among rotaviruses. Proline-scanning mutagenesis of the predicted helix revealed that single-amino-acid substitutions abolish NSP5 insolubility and hyperphosphorylation. Helix-disrupting NSP5 mutations also abolished localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NSP5 fusions into VLS and directly correlate VLS formation with NSP5 insolubility. All mutations introduced into the hydrophobic face of the predicted NSP5 α-helix disrupted VLS formation, NSP5 insolubility, and the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated NSP5 isoforms. Some NSP5 mutants were highly soluble but still were hyperphosphorylated, indicating that NSP5 insolubility was not required for hyperphosphorylation. Expression of GFP containing the last 68 residues of NSP5 at its C terminus resulted in the formation of punctate VLS within cells. Interestingly, GFP-NSP5-C68 was diffusely dispersed in the cytoplasm when calcium was depleted from the medium, and after calcium resupplementation GFP-NSP5-C68 rapidly accumulated into punctate VLS. A potential calcium switch, formed by two tandem pseudo-EF-hand motifs (DxDxD), is present just upstream of the predicted α-helix. Mutagenesis of either DxDxD motif abolished the regulatory effect of calcium on VLS formation and resulted in the constitutive assembly of GFP-NSP5-C68 into punctate VLS. These results reveal specific residues within the NSP5 C-terminal domain that direct NSP5 hyperphosphorylation, insolubility, and VLS formation in addition to defining residues that constitute a calcium-dependent trigger of VLS formation.

ABSTRACT Cellular and viral factors participate in the replication cycle of rotavirus. We report that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, which activates the small GTPase Arf1 to induce COPI transport processes, is required for rotavirus replication since knocking down GBF1 expression by RNA interference or inhibiting its activity by treatment with brefeldin A (BFA) or Golgicide A (GCA) significantly reduces the yield of infectious viral progeny. This reduction in virus yield was related to a block in virus assembly, since in the presence of either BFA or GCA, the assembly of infectious mature triple-layered virions was significantly prevented and only double-layered particles were detected. We report that the catalytic activity of GBF1, but not the activation of Arf1, is essential for the assembly of the outer capsid of rotavirus. We show that both BFA and GCA, as well as interfering with the synthesis of GBF1, alter the electrophoretic mobility of glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4 and block the trimerization of the virus surface protein VP7, a step required for its incorporation into virus particles. Although a posttranslational modification of VP7 (other than glycosylation) could be related to the lack of trimerization, we found that NSP4 might also be involved in this process, since knocking down its expression reduces VP7 trimerization.

Review of the previous studies led us to postulate that NSP2 binding of NSP5 may block the N terminus of NSP5 or render it inaccessible and that any similar N-terminal blockage may render NSP5 alone capable of producing VLS independent of NSP2. This possibility was addressed in this report by using two forms of NSP5-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras wherein GFP is fused at either the N or the C terminus of NSP5 (GFP-NSP5 and NSP5-GFP) and evaluating their VLS-forming capability (by light and electron microscopy) and phosphorylation and multimerization potential independent of NSP2. Our results demonstrate that NSP5 alone can form VLS when the N terminus is blocked by fusion with a nonrotavirus protein (GFP-NSP5) but the C terminus is unmodified. Only GFP-NSP5 was able to undergo hyperphosphorylation and multimerization with the native form of NSP5, emphasizing the importance of an unmodified C terminus for these events. Deletion analysis of NSP5 mapped the essential signals for VLS formation to the C terminus and clearly suggested that hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 is not required for VLS formation. The present study emphasizes in general that when fusion proteins are used for functional studies, constructs that represent fusions at both the N and the C termini of the protein should be evaluated.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that NSP5 alone can form VLS when the N terminus is blocked by fusion with a nonrotavirus protein (GFP-NSP5) but the C termini is unmodified, demonstrating the importance of an unmodified C terminus for these events."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":487,"details":{"paperId":"468cf3e4612e0f1926ed4def145510703db03b99","externalIds":{"MAG":"2156997922","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.80.7.3322-3331.2006","CorpusId":"21344735","PubMed":"16537599"},"title":"The Peptide-Binding and ATPase Domains of Recombinant hsc70 Are Required To Interact with Rotavirus and Reduce Its Infectivity","abstract":"ABSTRACT The heat shock cognate protein hsc70 has been implicated as a postattachment cell receptor for rotaviruses. Here we show that hsc70 interacts specifically with rotaviruses through its peptide-binding domain, since a recombinant full-length hsc70 protein and its peptide-binding domain, but not its ATPase domain, bound triple-layered particles in a solid-phase assay, and known ligands of hsc70 competed this binding. The peptide ligands of hsc70 were also shown to block rotavirus infectivity when added to cells before virus infection, suggesting that hsc70 on the surface of MA104 cells also interacts with the virus through its peptide-binding domain and that this interaction is important for virus entry. When purified infectious virus was incubated with soluble hsc70 in the presence of the cochaperone hsp40 and ATP and then pelleted through a sucrose cushion, the recovered virus had lost 60% of its infectivity, even though hsc70 was not detected in the pellet fraction. The hsc70-treated virus showed slightly different reactivities with monoclonal antibodies and was more susceptible to heat and basic pHs than the untreated virus, suggesting that hsc70 induces a subtle conformational change in the virus that results in a reduction of its infectivity. The relevance of the ATPase activity of hsc70 for reducing virus infectivity was demonstrated by the finding that in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, virus infectivity was not affected, and a mutant protein lacking ATPase activity failed to reduce virus infection. Altogether, these results suggest that during cell infection, the interaction of the virus with hsc70 on the surface of MA104 cells results in a conformational change of virus particles that facilitates their entry into the cell cytoplasm.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results suggest that during cell infection, the interaction of the virus with hsc70 on the surface of MA104 cells results in a conformational change of virus particles that facilitates their entry into the cell cytoplasm."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":15,"details":{"paperId":"4445af07f2621d88e3e958980104cdffaef74147","externalIds":{"MAG":"1981527661","DOI":"10.1006/VIRO.1993.1322","CorpusId":"12537560","PubMed":"8389083"},"title":"The RER-localized rotavirus intracellular receptor: a truncated purified soluble form is multivalent and binds virus particles.","abstract":"A budding event transfers the immature, single-shelled rotavirus particle (SSP) across the RER membrane prior to assembly of mature virions in the ER lumen.

Conversely, an antibody to VP5 inhibited the binding of nar3 but not that of RRV. These results suggest that while RRV binds to the cell through VP8, the variant does so through the VP5 domain of VP4. This observation was further sustained by the fact that recombinant VP8 and VP5 proteins, produced in bacteria as fusion products with glutathione S-transferase, were found to bind to MA104 cells in a specific and saturable manner and, when preincubated with the cell, were capable of inhibiting the binding of wild-type and variant viruses, respectively.

We sought to determine if the bovine rotavirus-derived VP8* of a reassortant neonatal G10P[11] virus interacts with hitherto uncharacterized glycans. In an array screen of >600 glycans, VP8* P[11] showed specific binding to glycans with the Galβ1-4GlcNAc motif, which forms the core structure of type II glycans and is the precursor of H type II HBGA. The specificity of glycan binding was confirmed through hemagglutination assays; GST-VP8* P[11] hemagglutinates type O, A, and B red blood cells as well as pooled umbilical cord blood erythrocytes. Further, G10P[11] infectivity was significantly enhanced by the expression of H type II HBGA in CHO cells.

In this study, we determined quantitatively the critical concentration of calcium ion that leads to solubilization of the outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7. Since this critical concentration is below or close to trace levels of Ca2+, we have used buffered solutions based on ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and Ca-EGTA. This method allowed us to show a very high variability of the free [Ca2+] needed to stabilize, at room temperature, the outer capsid of several rotavirus strains. This concentration is about 600 nM for the two bovine strains tested (RF and UK), 100 nM for the porcine strain OSU, and only 10 to 20 nM for the simian strain SA11. Titration of viral infectivity after incubation in buffer of defined [Ca2+] confirmed that the loss of infectivity occurs at different [Ca2+] for these three strains. For the bovine strain, the cleavage of VP4 by trypsin has no significant effect on the [Ca2+] that solubilizes outer shell proteins. The outer layer (VP7) of virus-like particles (VLP) made of recombinant proteins VP2, VP6, and VP7 (VLP2/6/7) was also solubilized by lowering the [Ca2+].

Genetic analysis of this phenotype in a set of reassortant viruses from two parental strains having the phenotypes of strains OSU (porcine) and UK (bovine) confirmed that this property of viral particles is probably associated with the gene coding for VP7.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the mechanism by which NSP4 causes an increase in [Ca2+]i by measuring the permeability of the cytoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in recombinant-baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. No obvious change in plasmalemma permeability to divalent cations was observed in cells expressing NSP4 compared with that in cells expressing another rotaviral glycoprotein (VP7) when the influx of Ba2+, a Ca2+ surrogate, was monitored. The basal Ca2+ permeability of the internal Ca2+ store was evaluated by measuring the release of Ca2+ induced by ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore, or thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the ER Ca(2+)-ATPase pump, following suspension of the cells in Ca(2+)-free extracellular buffer. Releasable Ca2+ decreased with time to a greater extent in cells expressing NSP4 compared with that in cells expressing VP7, suggesting that NSP4 increases the basal Ca2+ permeability of the ER membrane.

As rotavirus particles mature, they lose their transient membrane and a layer of the glycoprotein VP7 forms the virion outer capsid shell. The nonstructural glycoprotein NSP4 functions as an intracellular receptor in the ER membrane (K. S. Au, W. K. Chan, J. W. Burns, and M. K. Estes, J. Virol. 63:4553-4562, 1989), and it has been hypothesized that NSP4 is involved in the removal of the envelope during viral morphogenesis (M. K. Estes and J. Cohen, Microbiol. Rev. 53:410-449, 1989; B. L. Petrie, M. K. Estes, and D. Y. Graham, J. Virol. 46:270-274, 1983). The purpose of the present study was to determine if NSP4 has a direct membrane destabilization activity (MDA) by using liposome leakage assays and electron microscopic visualization of liposome, microsome, and viral envelope disruption. The fluorescent marker (calcein) incorporated into liposomes was released when the liposomes were incubated with purified NSP4. A region corresponding to amino acid residues 114 to 135 of NSP4 also released calcein from liposomes. NSP4(114-135) peptide-specific antibody completely blocked the MDA of the purified NSP4 protein. These results suggest that this region contains at least part of the functional domain of NSP4. Liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and microsomes (to simulate ER membranes) were broken when observed by electron microscopy after incubation with NSP4 or the NSP4(114-135) peptide. In contrast, the envelope of Sendai virus, which is derived from cytoplasmic membranes, and erythrocytes were not disrupted by NSP4 and the NSP4(114-135) peptide.

The viral nonstructural protein NSP5 is a major building block of viroplasms; it recruits the viral polymerase VP1, the core protein VP2, and the ATPase NSP2 inside the viroplasm to form the viral replication complex. Here we report that NSP5 is a unique viral metalloprotein that coordinates a [2Fe‐2S] iron‐sulfur cluster as demonstrated by the metal and labile sulfide contents, UV‐visible light absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance. Point mutations in NSP5 allowed us to identify C171 and C174, arranged in a CX2C motif, as essential residues for cluster coordination. When coexpressed with NSP2, an NSP5 mutant devoid of the iron‐sulfur cluster still forms viroplasm‐like structures. The cluster is therefore neither involved in the interaction with NSP2 nor in the formation of viroplasm‐like structures and thus presumably in viroplasm formation. Finally, we show using microscale thermophoresis that the iron‐sulfur cluster modulates the affinity of NSP5 for single‐stranded RNA. Because the cluster is near the binding sites of both the polymerase VP1 and the ATPase NSP2, we anticipate that this cluster is crucial for NSP5 functions, in either packaging or replication of the viral genome.—Martin, D., Charpilienne, A., Parent, A., Boussac, A., D'Autreaux, B., Poupon, J., Poncet, D.

Biochemical analysis with radiolabeled particles indicated that the stoichiometry of the VP4 in NTR particles was the same as that in TR particles and that the VP8∗ portion of NTR, but not TR, particles is susceptible to further proteolysis by trypsin. Taken together, these structural and biochemical data show that the VP4 spikes in the NTR TLPs are icosahedrally disordered and that they are conformationally different.

In this study the correlation between VP7 and resistance to low [Ca2+] was confirmed by analyzing the origin of gene 9 from reassortant viruses prepared under the selective pressure of low [Ca2+]. After chemical mutagenesis, we selected mutant viruses of the bovine strain RF that are more resistant to low [Ca2+].

The phenotype of mutants having a single proline change can be distinguished from the phenotype of mutants having two proline changes. Sequence analysis showed that position 75 is in a region (amino acids 65 to 78) of great variability and that proline 75 is present in most of the bovine strains. In contrast, proline 279 is in a conserved region and is conserved in all the VP7 sequences in data banks.

Susceptibility to SA-dependent or SA-independent rotavirus infection varied depending on the cell line tested and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) used. Cells of renal or intestinal origin and transformed cell lines derived from breast, stomach, bone, or lung were all susceptible to rotavirus infection, indicating a wider host tissue range than previously appreciated. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), guinea pig colon (GPC-16), rat small intestine (Rie1), and mouse duodenum (MODE-K) cells were found to support only limited rotavirus replication even at MOIs of 100 or 500, but delivery of rotavirus particles into the cytoplasm by lipofection resulted in efficient rotavirus replication. The rotavirus cell attachment protein, the outer capsid spike protein VP4, contains the sequence GDE(A) recognized by the VLA-2 (α2β1) integrin, and to test if VLA-2 is involved in rotavirus attachment and entry, we measured infection in CHO cells that lack VLA-2 and CHO cells transfected with the human α2 subunit (CHOα2) or with both the human α2 and β1 subunits (CHOα2β1) of VLA-2. Infection by SA-dependent or SA-independent rotavirus strains was 2- to 10-fold more productive in VLA-2-expressing CHO cells than in parental CHO cells, and the increased susceptibility to infection was blocked with anti-VLA-2 antibody. However, the levels of binding of rotavirus to CHO, CHOα2, and CHOα2β1 cells were equivalent and were not increased over binding to susceptible monkey kidney (MA104) cells or human colonic adenocarcinoma (Caco-2, HT-29, and T-84) cells, and binding was not blocked by antibody to the human α2 subunit. Although the VLA-2 integrin promotes rotavirus infection in CHO cells, it is clear that the VLA-2 integrin alone is not responsible for rotavirus cell attachment and entry.

The ability of rotavirus particles lacking genomic RNA to activate NF-κB suggested that rotavirus proteins direct cell signaling responses. We identified conserved TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) binding motifs within the rotavirus capsid protein VP4 and its N-terminal VP8* cleavage product. TRAFs (-1, -2, and -3) are bound by the rhesus rotavirus VP8* protein through three discrete TRAF binding domains. Expression of VP4 or VP8* from rhesus or human rotaviruses induced a 5–7-fold increase in NF-κB activity and synergistically enhanced TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation. Mutagenesis of VP8* TRAF binding motifs abolished VP8* binding to TRAFs and the ability of the protein to activate NF-κB. Expression of pathway-specific dominant negative (DN) inhibitors DN-TRAF2 or DN-NF-κB-inducing kinase also abolished VP8*-, VP4-, or rotavirus-mediated NF-κB activation. These findings demonstrate that rotavirus primarily activates NF-κB through a TRAF2-NF-κB-inducing kinase signaling pathway and that VP4 and VP8* proteins direct pathway activation through interactions with cellular TRAFs.

The experimental design that we describe may be useful for studying entry of other viral pathogens. ABSTRACT Bound calcium ions stabilize many nonenveloped virions. Loss of Ca2+ from these particles appears to be a regulated part of entry or uncoating. The outer layer of an infectious rotavirus triple-layered particle (TLP) comprises a membrane-interacting protein (VP4) anchored by a Ca2+-stabilized protein (VP7). Membrane-coupled conformational changes in VP4 (cleaved to VP8* and VP5*) and dissociation of VP4 and VP7 accompany penetration of the double-layered inner capsid particle (DLP) into the cytosol. Removal of Ca2+ in vitro strips away both outer layer proteins; we and others have postulated that the loss of Ca2+ triggers molecular events in viral penetration. We have now investigated, with the aid of a fluorescent Ca2+ sensor, the timing of Ca2+ loss from entering virions with respect to the dissociation of VP4 and VP7. In live-cell imaging experiments, distinct fluorescent markers on the DLP and on VP7 report on outer layer dissociation and DLP release. The Ca2+ sensor, placed on VP5*, monitors the Ca2+ concentration within the membrane-bound vesicle enclosing the entering particle. Slow (1-min duration) loss of Ca2+ precedes the onset of VP7 dissociation by about 2 min and DLP release by about 7 min. Coupled with our previous results showing that VP7 loss follows tight binding to the cell surface by about 5 min, these data indicate that Ca2+ loss begins as soon as the particle has become fully engulfed within the uptake vesicle. We discuss the implications of these findings for the molecular mechanism of membrane disruption during viral entry.

However, it is surprising why rotavirus infection has been overlooked as a cause of neonatal seizures for many years, despite significant research interest in neonatal rotavirus infection. Neonates are the age group most vulnerable to seizures, which are typically attributed to a wide range of causes. By contrast, because rotavirus infection is usually asymptomatic, it has been difficult to identify an association between this virus and neonatal seizures. The conventional wisdom has been that, although neonates are commonly infected with rotavirus, neurological complications are rare in this age. However, recent studies using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have suggested a connection between rotavirus infection and neonatal seizures and that rotavirus infection can induce diffuse white matter injury without direct invasion of the central nervous system. The clinical features of white matter injury in rotavirus-infected neonates include the onset of seizures at days 4–6 of life in apparently healthy term infants. The recent findings seem to contradict the conventional wisdom. However, white matter injury might not be a completely new aspect of rotavirus infection in neonates, considering the forgotten clinical entity of neonatal seizures, 'fifth day fits'. With increased use of DWI in neonatal seizures, we are just starting to understand connection between viral infection and white matter injury in neonates. In this review, we discuss the historical aspects of rotavirus infection and neonatal seizures. We also present the clinical features of white matter injury in neonatal rotavirus infection.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Recent studies using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have suggested a connection between rotavirus infection and neonatal seizures and that rotav virus infection can induce diffuse white matter injury without direct invasion of the central nervous system."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":101,"details":{"paperId":"98f618129117ebc0dd65c790b39450d37ed3c14c","externalIds":{"MAG":"2025802471","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmb.2010.01.055","CorpusId":"7882591","PubMed":"20122940"},"title":"X-ray crystal structure of the rotavirus inner capsid particle at 3.8 A resolution.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A model for rotavirus particle assembly is proposed, based on known requirements for virion formation, together with the structure of the DLP and that of VP1, determined earlier."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":259,"details":{"paperId":"7e669ce07e3a42b7bdc9ecf778ea00647f533c5e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2164913825","DOI":"10.1099/VIR.0.82255-0","CorpusId":"23180803","PubMed":"17251580"},"title":"Zinc-binding domain of rotavirus NSP1 is required for proteasome-dependent degradation of IRF3 and autoregulatory NSP1 stability.","abstract":"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a key transcription factor involved in the induction of interferon (IFN) in response to viral infection. Rotavirus non-structural protein NSP1 binds to and targets IRF3 for proteasome degradation early post-infection. Mutational analysis of cysteine and histidine residues within the conserved N-terminal zinc-binding domain in NSP1 of bovine rotavirus strain B641 abolished IRF3 degradation in transfected cells. Thus, the integrity of the zinc-binding domain in NSP1 is important for degradation of IRF3. In contrast to bovine strain B641, IRF3 was stable in cells infected with porcine rotavirus strain OSU and OSU NSP1 bound only weakly to IRF3. Both B641 NSP1 and OSU NSP1 were stabilized in cells or cell-free extracts in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and when the zinc-binding domain was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis. Data from the B641 analyses that show IRF3 degradation is dependent on the presence of NSP1 and the integrity of the N-terminal zinc-binding domain, coupled with the regulated stability of IRF3 and NSP1 by the proteasome, collectively support the hypothesis that NSP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Data from the B641 analyses that showIRF3 degradation is dependent on the presence of NSP1 and the integrity of the N-terminal zinc-binding domain, coupled with the regulated stability of IRF3 and NSP 1 by the proteasome, collectively support the hypothesis that N SP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":110,"details":{"paperId":"d17f1a951ce0bcea1b9add1fc4411ff6ea90f783","externalIds":{"MAG":"2015631630","DOI":"10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.08.028","CorpusId":"205617588","PubMed":"19781872"},"title":"Zoonotic aspects of rotaviruses.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Genetic heterogeneity in the 11 double stranded RNA segments across different rotavirus strains has provided evidence for frequent intersections between the evolution of human and animal rotaviruses, as a result of multiple, repeated events of interspecies transmission and subsequent adaptation."}},"tag":"OTHER"},{"id":407,"details":{"paperId":"b9231be3d218f1e585c1801dda99f6b62f2bef00","externalIds":{"MAG":"2106615577","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.70.6.3961-3971.1996","CorpusId":"1734407","PubMed":"8648733"},"title":"cis-Acting signals that promote genome replication in rotavirus mRNA","abstract":"A previous study has shown that rotavirus cores have an associated replicase activity which can direct the synthesis of double-stranded RNA from viral mRNA in a cell-free system (D. Y. Chen, C. Q.-Y. Zeng, M. J. Wentz, M. Gorziglia, M. K. Estes, and R. F. Ramig, J. Virol. 68:7030-7039, 1994). To define the cis-acting signals in rotavirus mRNA that are important for RNA replication, gene 8 transcripts which contained internal and terminal deletions and chimeric transcripts which linked gene 8-specific 3'-terminal sequences to the ends of nonviral sequences were generated. Analysis of these RNAs in the cell-free system led to the identification of a cis-acting signal in the gene 8 mRNA which is essential for RNA replication and two cis-acting signals which, while not essential for replication, serve to enhance the process. The sequence of the essential replication signal is located at the extreme 3' end of the gene 8 mRNA and, because of its highly conserved nature, is probably a common feature of all 11 viral mRNAs. By site-specific mutagenesis of the gene 8 mRNA, residues at positions -1, -2, -5, -6, and -7 of the 3' essential signal were found to be particularly important for promoting RNA replication. One of the cis-acting signals shown to enhance the replication in the cell-free system was located near the 5' end of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene 8 mRNA, while remarkably the other was located in the 5' UTR of the message. The existence of an enhancement signal in the 5' UTR raises the possibility that the 5' and 3' ends of the rotavirus mRNA may interact with each other and/or with the viral replicase during genome replication.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"One of the cis-acting signals shown to enhance the replication in the cell-free system was located near the 5' end of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene 8 mRNA, while the existence of an enhancement signal in the5' UTR raises the possibility that the 5', 3' ends of the rotavirus mRNA may interact with each other and/or with the viral replicase during genome replication."}},"tag":"EXP"}]
