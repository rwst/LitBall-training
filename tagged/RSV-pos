These filaments contain viral genomic RNA and structural proteins, including the fusion (F) protein, matrix (M) protein, nucleoprotein (N), and phosphoprotein (P), while excluding F-actin. It is known that the F protein cytoplasmic tail (FCT) is necessary for filament formation, but the mechanism by which the FCT mediates assembly into filaments is not clear. We hypothesized that the FCT is necessary for interactions with other viral proteins in order to form filaments. In order to test this idea, we expressed the F protein with cytoplasmic tail (CT) truncations or specific point mutations and determined the abilities of these variant F proteins to form filaments independent of viral infection when coexpressed with M, N, and P. Deletion of the terminal three FCT residues (amino acids Phe-Ser-Asn) or mutation of the Phe residue resulted in a loss of filament formation but did not affect F-protein expression or trafficking to the cell surface. Filament formation could be restored by addition of residues Phe-Ser-Asn to an FCT deletion mutant and was unaffected by mutations to Ser or Asn residues. Second, deletion of residues Phe-Ser-Asn or mutation of the Phe residue resulted in a loss of M, N, and P incorporation into virus-like particles. These data suggest that a C-terminal Phe residue in the FCT mediates assembly through incorporation of internal virion proteins into virus filaments at the cell surface.

While many of these genes enable pathogen clearance, some enhance pathogen growth or contribute to disease symptoms. Many studies have profiled transcriptomic and proteomic responses to infection, generating large data sets, but selecting targets for further study is challenging. Here we propose a novel data-mining approach combining multiple heterogeneous data sets to prioritize genes for further study by using respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection as a model pathogen with a significant health care impact. The assumption was that the more frequently a gene is detected across multiple studies, the more important its role is. A literature search was performed to find data sets of genes and proteins that change after RSV infection. The data sets were standardized, collated into a single database, and then panned to determine which genes occurred in multiple data sets, generating a candidate gene list. This candidate gene list was validated by using both a clinical cohort and in vitro screening. We identified several genes that were frequently expressed following RSV infection with no assigned function in RSV control, including IFI27, IFIT3, IFI44L, GBP1, OAS3, IFI44, and IRF7. Drilling down into the function of these genes, we demonstrate a role in disease for the gene for interferon regulatory factor 7, which was highly ranked on the list, but not for IRF1, which was not. Thus, we have developed and validated an approach for collating published data sets into a manageable list of candidates, identifying novel targets for future analysis.

Firstly, RSV was attached to lipid rafts of the cell membrane, and then it was efficiently delivered into the perinuclear region within 2 h post-infection, mostly moving and residing into the lysosome compartment. Moreover, the relatively slow velocity of RSV transport across the cytoplasm and the formation of the actin tail indicated actin-based RSV motility, which was also confirmed by the effects of cytoskeletal inhibitors.

However, despite their critical role during infection, the principles that drive the selection and evolution of cbVGs within a virus population are poorly understood. As cbVGs are dependent on the virus replication machinery to be generated and replicated, we hypothesized that host factors that affect virus replication exert selective pressure on cbVGs and drive their evolution within a virus population. To test this hypothesis, we used respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as model and took an experimental evolution approach by serially passaging RSV in immune competent A549 control and immune deficient A549 STAT1 KO cells which allow higher levels of virus replication. As predicted, we observed that virus populations accumulated higher amounts of cbVGs in the more permissive A549 STAT1 KO cells over time but, unexpectedly, the predominant cbVG species after passages in the two conditions were different. While A549 STAT1 KO cells accumulated relatively short cbVGs, A549 control cells mainly contained cbVGs of much longer predicted size that have not been described previously.

ARP2 knockdown did not reduce RSV entry, and did not markedly reduce gene expression during the first 24 hr of infection, but decreased viral gene expression thereafter, an effect that appeared to be due to inhibition of viral spread to neighboring cells. Consistent with reduced spread, there was a 10-fold reduction in the release of infectious progeny virions in ARP2-depleted cells at 72 hr post-infection. In addition, we found that RSV infection induced filopodia formation and increased cell motility in A549 cells and that this phenotype was ARP2 dependent.

However, only a poor induction of type I IFNs is observed during RSV infection, suggesting that RSV has evolved mechanisms to prevent type I IFN expression by the infected host cell. ABSTRACT Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants worldwide. Nonstructural protein NS1 of RSV modulates the host innate immune response by acting as an antagonist of type I and type III interferon (IFN) production and signaling in multiple ways. Likely, NS1 performs this function by interacting with different host proteins. In order to obtain a comprehensive overview of the NS1 interaction partners, we performed three complementary protein-protein interaction screens, i.e., BioID, MAPPIT, and KISS. To closely mimic a natural infection, the BioID proximity screen was performed using a recombinant RSV in which the NS1 protein is fused to a biotin ligase. Remarkably, MED25, a subunit of the Mediator complex, was identified in all three performed screening methods as a potential NS1-interacting protein. We confirmed the interaction between MED25 and RSV NS1 by coimmunoprecipitation, not only upon overexpression of NS1 but also with endogenous NS1 during RSV infection. We also demonstrate that the replication of RSV can be enhanced in MED25 knockout A549 cells, suggesting a potential antiviral role of MED25 during RSV infection. Mediator subunits function as transcriptional coactivators and are involved in transcriptional regulation of their target genes. Therefore, the interaction between RSV NS1 and cellular MED25 might be beneficial for RSV during infection by affecting host transcription and the host immune response to infection. IMPORTANCE Innate immune responses, including the production of type I and III interferons, play a crucial role in the first line of defense against RSV infection. However, only a poor induction of type I IFNs is observed during RSV infection, suggesting that RSV has evolved mechanisms to prevent type I IFN expression by the infected host cell. A unique RSV protein, NS1, is largely responsible for this effect, probably through interaction with multiple host proteins. A better understanding of the interactions that occur between RSV NS1 and host proteins may help to identify targets for an effective antiviral therapy. We addressed this question by performing three complementary protein-protein interaction screens and identified MED25 as an RSV NS1-interacting protein. We propose a role in innate anti-RSV defense for this Mediator complex subunit.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The interaction between RSV NS1 and cellular MED25 might be beneficial for RSV during infection by affecting host transcription and the host immune response to infection, and a role in innate anti-RSV defense for this Mediator complex subunit is proposed."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":8,"details":{"paperId":"ffc76c110b4e356b3be76bf636194e14abb8ee46","externalIds":{"MAG":"2016867278","DOI":"10.1006/VIRO.1994.1245","CorpusId":"5992795","PubMed":"8178462"},"title":"Analysis of respiratory syncytial virus F, G, and SH proteins in cell fusion.","abstract":"Recombinant expression of the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) glycoprotein, receptor-binding glycoprotein (G), and small hydrophobic (SH) protein was performed to determine the role(s) of these proteins in syncytia formation.

The GS signal, which is the start site for mRNA synthesis, is highly conserved for the first nine genes: 3'-CCCCGUUUA(U/C) (negative sense). This conserved version of the signal was analyzed by \"saturation\" mutagenesis, in which all 10 positions, as well as one downstream and one upstream position, were changed one at a time into each of the other three nucleotides. Most of the positions appear to contribute to the signal: positions 1, 3, 6, 7, and, in particular, 9 were the most sensitive, whereas position 5 was relatively insensitive. The effect of nucleotide substitution in the first position of the signal was examined further by cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of the residual mRNA which was produced. For the two mutants examined (1C to U, and 1C to A), the site of initiation was unchanged. However, the mRNAs were dimorphic with regard to the assignment of the 5'-terminal nucleotide: two-thirds contained the predicted mutant substitution, and one-third contained the parental assignment. Intracellular minigenome contained only the mutant assignment, indicating that the heterogeneity was at the level of transcription by the RSV polymerase. This suggests that the templated mutant assignment at position 1 can sometimes be overridden by an innate preference for the parental assignment, a phenomenon which we dubbed quasi-templated initiation. The GS signal of the L gene, encoding the 10th RSV mRNA, contains three differences (3'-CCCUGUUUUA) compared to the conserved version. It was shown to be equal in efficiency to the conserved version. This was unexpected, since the saturation mutagenesis described above indicated that U in place of A at position 9 should be highly inhibitory. Instead, the A at position 10 of the L GS signal was found to be critical for activity, indicating that an essential A residue indeed was present in both versions of the GS signal but that its spacing differed. The GE signal, which directs termination and polyadenylation, has more sequence diversity in nature than does the GS signal. The naturally occurring GE signals of strain A2 were compared by their individual incorporation into a dicistronic minigenome.

In contrast, directional budding is not observed in nonpolarized human epithelial cells. These findings suggest that RSV uses specific cellular trafficking pathways to accomplish viral replication. The host cell proteins that regulate directional budding of RSV are undefined. Apical sorting of cellular proteins in polarized epithelial cells involves the apical recycling endosome (ARE).

Radioimmune precipitation of [3H]glucosamine-labelled glycoproteins by large glycoprotein (G)-specific or fusion protein (F)-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) revealed that the G, F1 and F2 proteins were present in cell extracts but only the G protein was clearly evident in culture fluids. A glycoprotein (Mr 43K) which may be a precursor or a breakdown product of the G protein was also precipitated by the G-specific MAb from cell extracts and culture fluids. The G protein in culture fluids was slightly smaller (Mr 82K) than the G protein in cell extracts (Mr 88K). An abundant or heavily labelled, 18K glycoprotein in the fluids of virus-infected but not of mock-infected cells was weakly precipitated by the F-specific MAb; this suggested that the 18K protein shares epitopes with the fusion protein of RS virus. The absence of F1 and F2 polypeptides from culture fluids is evidence that the cells, which contained an abundance of these proteins, were intact. To determine whether any of the viral glycoproteins released by infected cells were soluble (non-virion-associated), culture fluid was subjected to rate zonal centrifugation in a 10 to 50% sucrose gradient. An assay of fractions using a MAb-capture ELISA for the nucleocapsid (N) and F proteins revealed a peak of activity, due to virions, in the centre of the gradient, and a strong signal for the N protein at the top of the gradient suggesting that N protein was released from intact cells.

Humans become infected with RSV through the inhalation of viral particles exhaled from an infected individual. ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contains a conserved CX3C motif on the ectodomain of the G protein. The motif has been indicated as facilitating attachment of the virus to the host, initiating infection via the human CX3CR1 receptor. The natural CX3CR1 ligand, CX3CL1, has been shown to induce signaling pathways resulting in transcriptional changes in the host cells. We hypothesize that binding of RSV to CX3CR1 via CX3C leads to transcriptional changes in host epithelial cells. Using transcriptomic analysis, the effect of CX3CR1 engagement by RSV was investigated. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were infected with RSV virus containing either wild-type (WT) G protein or a mutant virus containing a CX4C mutation in the G protein. RNA sequencing was performed on mock-infected and 4-days-postinfected cultures. NHBE cultures were also treated with purified recombinant wild-type A2 G protein. Here, we report that RSV infection resulted in significant changes in the levels of 766 transcripts. Many nuclear-associated proteins were upregulated in the WT group, including nucleolin. In contrast, cilium-associated genes, including CC2D2A and CFAP221 (PCDP1), were downregulated. The addition of recombinant G protein to the culture led to the suppression of cilium-related genes while also inducing nucleolin. Mutation of the CX3C motif (CX4C) reversed these effects on transcription, decreasing nucleolin induction and lessening the suppression of cilium-related transcripts in culture. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated decreases in ciliated cells and altered morphology. Therefore, it appears that engagement of CX3CR1 leads to induction of genes necessary for RSV entry as well as dysregulation of genes associated with the function of cilia. IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has an enormous impact on infants and the elderly, including increased fatality rates and potential for causing lifelong lung problems. Humans become infected with RSV through the inhalation of viral particles exhaled from an infected individual. These virus particles contain specific proteins that the virus uses to attach to human ciliated lung epithelial cells, initiating infection. Two viral proteins, G protein and F protein, have been shown to bind to human CX3CR1and nucleolin, respectively. Here, we show that the G protein induces nucleolin and suppresses gene transcripts specific to ciliated cells. Furthermore, we show that mutation of the CX3C-motif on the G protein, CX4C, reverses these transcriptional changes.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It appears that engagement of CX3CR1 leads to induction of genes necessary for RSV entry as well as dysregulation of genes associated with the function of cilia."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":441,"details":{"paperId":"aec1f2ec6484353663caf65f08a85d8f93491f67","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4479564","MAG":"1527926071","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0130517","CorpusId":"15184932","PubMed":"26107373"},"title":"CX3CR1 Is Expressed in Differentiated Human Ciliated Airway Cells and Co-Localizes with Respiratory Syncytial Virus on Cilia in a G Protein-Dependent Manner","abstract":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the principal cause of bronchiolitis in infants and a significant healthcare problem. The RSV Glycoprotein (G) mediates attachment of the virus to the cell membrane, which facilitates interaction of the RSV Fusion (F) protein with nucleolin, thereby triggering fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. However, a host protein ligand for G has not yet been identified. Here we show that CX3CR1 is expressed in the motile cilia of differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cells, and that CX3CR1 co-localizes with RSV particles. Upon infection, the distribution of CX3CR1 in these cells is significantly altered. Complete or partial deletion of RSV G results in viruses binding at least 72-fold less efficiently to cells, and reduces virus replication. Moreover, an antibody targeting an epitope near the G protein’s CX3CR1-binding motif significantly inhibits binding of the virus to airway cells. Given previously published evidence of the interaction of G with CX3CR1 in human lymphocytes, these findings suggest a role for G in the interaction of RSV with ciliated lung cells. This interpretation is consistent with past studies showing a protective benefit in immunizing against G in animal models of RSV infection, and would support targeting the CX3CR1-G protein interaction for prophylaxis or therapy.

ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been reported to use CX3CR1 in vitro as a receptor on cultured primary human airway epithelial cultures. To evaluate CX3CR1 as the receptor for RSV in vivo, we used the cotton rat animal model because of its high permissiveness for RSV infection. Sequencing the cotton rat CX3CR1 gene revealed 91% amino acid similarity to human CX3CR1. Previous work found that RSV binds to CX3CR1 via its attachment glycoprotein (G protein) to infect primary human airway cultures. To determine whether CX3CR1-G protein interaction is necessary for RSV infection, recombinant RSVs containing mutations in the CX3CR1 binding site of the G protein were tested in cotton rats. In contrast to wild-type virus, viral mutants did not grow in the lungs of cotton rats. When RSV was incubated with an antibody blocking the CX3CR1 binding site of G protein and subsequently inoculated intranasally into cotton rats, no virus was found in the lungs 4 days postinfection. In contrast, growth of RSV was not affected after preincubation with heparan sulfate (the receptor for RSV on immortalized cell lines). A reduction in CX3CR1 expression in the cotton rat lung through the use of peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers led to a 10-fold reduction in RSV titers at day 4 postinfection. In summary, these results indicate that CX3CR1 functions as a receptor for RSV in cotton rats and, in combination with data from human airway epithelial cell cultures, strongly suggest that CX3CR1 is a primary receptor for naturally acquired RSV infection.

Understanding the biology of infection, including virus binding to the cell surface, should help develop antiviral drugs or vaccines. The RSV F and G glycoproteins bind cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) through heparin-binding domains. The G protein also has a CX3C chemokine motif which binds to the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1. G protein binding to CX3CR1 is not important for infection of immortalized cell lines, but reportedly is so for primary human airway epithelial cells (HAECs), the primary site for human infection. We studied the role of CX3CR1 in RSV infection with CX3CR1-transfected cell lines and HAECs with variable percentages of CX3CR1-expressing cells, and the effect of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies or a mutation in the RSV CX3C motif. Immortalized cells lacking HSPGs had low RSV binding and infection, which was increased markedly by CX3CR1 transfection. CX3CR1 was expressed primarily on ciliated cells, and ∼50 % of RSV-infected cells in HAECs were CX3CR1+. HAECs with more CX3CR1-expressing cells had a proportional increase in RSV infection. Blocking G binding to CX3CR1 with anti-CX3CR1 antibody or a mutation in the CX3C motif significantly decreased RSV infection in HAECs. The kinetics of cytokine production suggested that the RSV/CX3CR1 interaction induced RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted protein), IL-8 and fractalkine production, whilst it downregulated IL-15, IL1-RA and monocyte chemotactic protein-1.

RNP recognition by the viral polymerase involves a specific interaction between the C-terminal domain of the phosphoprotein (P) (PCTD) and N.

In this study, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays were used to identify the N-terminal core domain of HRSV N (NNTD) as a P binding domain. A biochemical characterization of the PCTD and molecular modeling of the NNTD allowed us to define four potential candidate pockets on N (pocket I [PI] to PIV) as hydrophobic sites surrounded by positively charged regions, which could constitute sites complementary to the PCTD interaction domain. The role of selected amino acids in the recognition of the N-RNA complex by P was first screened for by site-directed mutagenesis using a polymerase activity assay, based on an HRSV minigenome containing a luciferase reporter gene. When changed to Ala, most of the residues of PI were found to be critical for viral RNA synthesis, with the R132A mutant having the strongest effect. These mutations also reduced or abolished in vitro and in vivo P-N interactions, as determined by GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments.

The binding and entry mechanism by which RSV infects respiratory epithelial cells has not yet been determined. In this study, the earliest stages of RSV infection in normal human bronchial epithelial cells were probed by tracking virions with fluorescent lipophilic dyes in their membranes. Virions colocalized with cholesterol-containing plasma membrane microdomains, identified by their ability to bind cholera toxin subunit B. Consistent with an important role for cholesterol in RSV infection, cholesterol depletion profoundly inhibited RSV infection, while cholesterol repletion reversed this inhibition. Merger of the outer leaflets of the viral envelope and the cell membrane appeared to be triggered at these sites. Using small-molecule inhibitors, RSV infection was found to be sensitive to Pak1 inhibition, suggesting the requirement of a subsequent step of cytoskeletal reorganization that could involve plasma membrane rearrangements or endocytosis.

This inhibition is mediated by multiple protein-protein interactions and involves the formation of large oligomeric complexes. There is neither a structure nor sequence or functional homologues of this protein, which points to a distinctive mechanism for blocking the interferon response among viruses. The NS1 native monomer follows a simple unfolding kinetics via a nativelike transition state ensemble, with a half-life of 45 min, in agreement with a highly stable core structure at equilibrium. Refolding is a complex process that involves several slowly interconverting species compatible with proline isomerization. However, an ultrafast folding event with a half-life of 0.2 ms is indicative of a highly folding compatible species within the unfolded state ensemble. On the other hand, the oligomeric assembly route from the native monomer, which does not involve unfolding, shows a monodisperse and irreversible end-point species triggered by a mild temperature change, with half-lives of 160 and 26 min at 37 and 47 °C, respectively, and at a low protein concentration (10 μM). A large secondary structure change into β-sheet structure and the formation of a dimeric nucleus precede polymerization by the sequential addition of monomers at the surprisingly low rate of one monomer every 34 s. The polymerization phase is followed by the binding to thioflavin-T indicative of amyloid-like, albeit soluble, repetitive β-sheet quaternary structure. The overall process is reversible only up until ~8 min, a time window in which most of the secondary structure change takes place. NS1's multiple binding activities must be accommodated in a few binding interfaces at most, something to be considered remarkable given its small size (15 kDa). Thus, conformational heterogeneity, and in particular oligomer formation, may provide a means of expand its binding repertoire. These equilibria will be determined by variables such as macromolecular crowding, protein-protein interactions, expression levels, turnover, or specific subcellular localization. The irreversible and quasi-spontaneous nature of the oligomer assembly, together with the fact that NS1 is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells, makes its accumulation highly conceivable under conditions compatible with the cellular milieu.

Hospitalizations during the winter season due to hRSV-induced bronchiolitis and pneumonia increase every year. Despite this, there are no available vaccines to mitigate the health and economic burden caused by hRSV infection. The pathology caused by hRSV induces significant damage to the pulmonary epithelium, due to an excessive inflammatory response at the airways. Cytokines are considered essential players for the establishment and modulation of the immune and inflammatory responses, which can either be beneficial or harmful for the host. The deleterious effect observed upon hRSV infection is mainly due to tissue damage caused by immune cells recruited to the site of infection. This cellular recruitment takes place due to an altered profile of cytokines secreted by epithelial cells. As a result of inflammatory cell recruitment, the amounts of cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and CCL5 are further increased, while IL-10 and IFN-γ are decreased. However, additional studies are required to elicit the mediators directly associated with hRSV damage entirely. In addition to the detrimental induction of inflammatory mediators in the respiratory tract caused by hRSV, reports indicating alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) have been published.

Here, we investigated the role of the attachment G glycoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in viral infection. RSV G is produced both as a complete, transmembrane form and as an N-terminally truncated form that is secreted. Using reverse genetics, we created mutant recombinant RSVs (rRSV) that do not express G (DeltaG) or express either the secreted or the membrane-bound form of G only (sG and mG, respectively). In Vero cells, the DeltaG virus formed plaques and grew as efficiently as wild-type rRSV and mG. In contrast, DeltaG replicated less efficiently and did not form distinct plaques in HEp-2 cells. This defect was primarily at the level of the initiation of infection, with only a minor additional effect at the level of packaging. Replication of DeltaG in the respiratory tract of mice was very highly restricted, indicating that G is important in vivo. Although the G protein expressed by the sG virus was confirmed to be secreted, this virus grew at least as efficiently as wild-type in HEp-2 cells and was only moderately attenuated in vivo. Thus, the G protein was important for efficient replication in HEp-2 cells and in vivo, but this function could be supplied in large part by the secreted form and thus does not require the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. Amino acids 184-198 have been identified as the major heparin-binding domain of the G protein and were implicated in mediating binding to cells [S. A. Feldman et al., 1999, J. Virol. 73, 6610-6617]. Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans also appeared to be important for infection in vitro by direct clinical isolates of RSV. Deletion of amino acids 187-197 from rRSV did not reduce its sensitivity to neutralization in vitro by incubation with soluble heparin, did not reduce its efficiency of growth in vitro, and resulted in only a modest reduction in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis in infants <24 months of age. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to August 2018. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently screened results to include economic evaluations conducted between 2000 and 2018 from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted outcomes. Quality appraisal was completed by using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. Costs were adjusted to 2017 US dollars. RESULTS: We identified 28 economic evaluations (20 cost-utility analyses and 8 cost-effectiveness analyses); most were from the United States (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). Study quality was high; 23 studies met >80% of the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Palivizumab prophylaxis ranged from a dominant strategy to having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2 526 203 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) depending on study perspective and targeted population. From the payer perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for preterm infants (29–35 weeks’ gestational age) was between $5188 and $791 265 per QALY, with 90% of estimates <$50 000 per QALY. Influential parameters were RSV hospitalization reduction rates, palivizumab cost, and discount rate.

For unlabelled HRSVN, only crystals belonging to space group P2(1) were obtained that diffracted to 3.6 A. A self-rotation function using data from the orthorhombic crystal form confirmed the presence of tenfold noncrystallographic symmetry, which is in agreement with a reported electron-microscopic reconstruction of HRSVN. Monomeric HRSVN generated by N-terminal truncation was designed to assist in structure determination by reducing the size of the asymmetric unit. Whilst such HRSVN mutants were monomeric in solution and crystallized in a different space group, the size of the asymmetric unit was not reduced.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A self-rotation function using data from the orthorhombic crystal form confirmed the presence of tenfold noncrystallographic symmetry, which is in agreement with a reported electron-microscopic reconstruction of HRSVN."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7,"details":{"paperId":"947bf313d975773e19da9da74ee2a4641a89e7e3","externalIds":{"MAG":"1974451794","DOI":"10.1006/VIRO.1993.1366","CorpusId":"19111332","PubMed":"8317099"},"title":"Cytoplasmic inclusions of respiratory syncytial virus-infected cells: formation of inclusion bodies in transfected cells that coexpress the nucleoprotein, the phosphoprotein, and the 22K protein.","abstract":"Immunofluorescence staining and immunoelectron microscopy of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus-infected cells revealed the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions that were specifically labeled with monoclonal antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein (NP), the phosphoprotein (P), or the 22K protein.

The virus assembles and buds through the plasma membrane, forming elongated membrane filaments, but details of how this happens remain obscure. Oligomerization of the matrix protein (M) is a key step in the process of assembly and infectious virus production. In addition, it was suggested to affect the conformation of the fusion protein, the major current target for RSV antivirals, in the mature virus. The structure and assembly of M are thus key parameters in the RSV antiviral development strategy. The structure of RSV M was previously published as a monomer. Other paramyxovirus M proteins have been shown to dimerize, and biochemical data suggest that RSV M also dimerizes. Here, using size exclusion chromatography-multiangle laser light scattering, we show that the protein is dimeric in solution. We also crystallized M in two crystal forms and show that it assembles into equivalent dimers in both lattices. Dimerization interface mutations destabilize the M dimer in vitro. To assess the biological relevance of dimerization, we used confocal imaging to show that dimerization interface mutants of M fail to assemble into viral filaments on the plasma membrane. Additionally, budding and release of virus-like particles are prevented in M mutants that fail to form filaments. Importantly, we show that M is biologically active as a dimer and that the switch from M dimers to higher-order oligomers triggers viral filament assembly and virus production. IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent cause of infantile bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The enormous burden of RSV makes it a major unmet target for a vaccine and antiviral drug therapy. Oligomerization of the matrix protein is a key step in the process of assembly and production of infectious virus, but the molecular mechanism of RSV assembly is still poorly understood. Here we show that the RSV matrix protein forms dimers in solution and in crystals; the dimer is essential for formation of higher-order oligomers. Destabilizing the dimer interface resulted in the loss of RSV filament formation and a lack of budding of virus-like particles. Importantly, our findings can potentially lead to new structure-based RSV inhibitors targeting the assembly process.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that the RSV matrix protein forms dimers in solution and in crystals; the dimer is essential for formation of higher-order oligomers, and can potentially lead to new structure-based RSV inhibitors targeting the assembly process."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":454,"details":{"paperId":"696398e7316a1195c4fd5bebce08c26a871e68c6","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"6023113","MAG":"2810988926","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1007015","CorpusId":"49586510","PubMed":"29953542"},"title":"Direct cell-to-cell transmission of respiratory viruses: The fast lanes","abstract":"Virus particles protect genomes from hostile environments within and outside the host, eventually delivering these genomes to target tissues to initiate infection.

Polymerase structures from three different non-segmented negative strand RNA virus (nsNSV) families revealed putative priming loops in different conformations, and an aromatic priming residue has been identified in the rhabdovirus polymerase. In a previous study of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) polymerase, we found that Tyr1276, the L protein aromatic amino acid residue that most closely aligns with the rhabdovirus priming residue, is not required for RNA synthesis but two nearby residues, Pro1261 and Trp1262, were required. In this study, we examined the roles of Pro1261 and Trp1262 in RNA synthesis initiation. Biochemical studies showed that substitution of Pro1261 inhibited RNA synthesis initiation without inhibiting back-priming, indicating a defect in initiation. Biochemical and minigenome experiments showed that the initiation defect incurred by a P1261A substitution could be rescued by factors that would be expected to increase the stability of the initiation complex, specifically increased NTP concentration, manganese, and a more efficient promoter sequence. These findings indicate that Pro1261 of the RSV L protein plays a role in initiation, most likely in stabilizing the initiation complex. However, we found that substitution of the corresponding proline residue in a filovirus polymerase had no effect on RNA synthesis initiation or elongation. These results indicate that despite similarities between the nsNSV polymerases, there are differences in the features required for RNA synthesis initiation. Author Summary RSV has a significant impact on human health. It is the major cause of respiratory disease in infants and exerts a significant toll on the elderly and immunocompromised. RSV is a member of the Mononegavirales, the non-segmented, negative strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs). Like other viruses in this order, RSV encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing and replicating the viral genome. Due to its essential role during the viral replication cycle, the polymerase is a promising candidate target for antiviral inhibitors and so a greater understanding of the mechanistic basis of its activities could aid antiviral drug development. In this study, we identified an amino acid residue within the RSV polymerase that appears to stabilize the RNA synthesis initiation complex and showed that it plays a role in both transcription and RNA replication. However, the corresponding residue in a different nsNSV polymerase does not appear to play a similar role. This work reveals a key feature of the RSV polymerase but identifies differences with the polymerases of other related viruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An amino acid residue within the RSV polymerase appears to stabilize the RNA synthesis initiation complex and showed that it plays a role in both transcription and RNA replication, however, the corresponding residue in a different nsNSV polymerases does not appear to play a similar role."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":112,"details":{"paperId":"6b58d9694fd8e84927770c17f407a3b96adcf40a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2068473963","DOI":"10.1016/S0042-6822(02)00016-8","CorpusId":"20958788","PubMed":"12642099"},"title":"Distribution of the attachment (G) glycoprotein and GM1 within the envelope of mature respiratory syncytial virus filaments revealed using field emission scanning electron microscopy.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This report describes the first use of FE SEM to map the distribution of specific structural components within the envelope of a Paramyxovirus."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":131,"details":{"paperId":"6e57442979c4e288a8af4ba124f62a19090cd44d","externalIds":{"MAG":"45460210","DOI":"10.1023/A:1008188527858","CorpusId":"2722481","PubMed":"10949949"},"title":"Domains of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus P Protein Essential for Homodimerization and for Binding to N and NS1 Protein","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The two-hybrid technique was used to test for binding among human respiratory syncytial virus proteins involved in the control of viral replication and the expected positive interactions for the nucleoprotein (N) with itself and the phosphop protein (P)."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":449,"details":{"paperId":"0c6fe5cd20b037e1365f54c12dc2f633d8dc5404","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4859522","MAG":"2347142754","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1005622","CorpusId":"2714347","PubMed":"27152417"},"title":"EGFR Interacts with the Fusion Protein of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Strain 2-20 and Mediates Infection and Mucin Expression","abstract":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness in children.

However, vaccine development has been hindered by a legacy of vaccine-enhanced disease, poor viral immunogenicity in infants, and genetic and physical instabilities. Natural infection with RSV does not prime for enhanced disease encouraging development of live-attenuated RSV vaccines for infants; however, physical instabilities of RSV may limit vaccine development. The role of RSV strain-specific differences on viral physical stability remains unclear. We have previously demonstrated that the RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein is responsible for mediating significant differences in thermostability between strains A2 and A2-line19F. In this study, we performed a more comprehensive analysis to characterize the replication and physical stability of recombinant RSV A and B strains that differed only in viral attachment (G) and/or F surface glycoprotein expression. We observed significant differences in thermal stability, syncytia size, pre-fusion F incorporation and viral growth kinetics in vitro, but limited variations to pH and freeze-thaw inactivation among several tested strains. Consistent with earlier studies, A2-line19F showed significantly enhanced thermal stability over A2, but also restricted growth kinetics in both HEp2 and Vero cells. As expected, no significant differences in susceptibility to UV inactivation were observed.

A panel of minigenomes containing additional sequence at the 3′ end of the Le were analyzed for their ability to direct antigenome and mRNA synthesis.

However, the activity of a minigenome with a 56-nucleotide extension could be restored by insertion of Le nucleotides 1 to 11 or 1 to 13 at the 3′ end, indicating that these nucleotides, in conjunction with the 3′ terminus, are sufficient to recruit polymerase to the template. Northern blot and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of antigenome RNA indicated that antigenome initiation occurred at the first position of Le, irrespective of the terminal extension.

To investigate this question, mutations were introduced into the 3′ terminal base of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) template, and the RNA products were examined to determine the impact of the mutation. To perform the assay, RNA replication was reconstituted using a modified minireplicon system in which replication was limited to a single step. Importantly, this system allowed analysis of RSV RNA generated intracellularly, but from a defined template that was not subject to selection by replication. Sequence analysis of RNA products generated from templates containing 1U-C and 1U-A substitutions showed that, in both cases, replication products were initiated with a nontemplated, WT A residue, rather than a templated G or U residue, indicating that the polymerase selects the terminal NTP independently of the template. Examination of a template in which the position 1 nucleotide was deleted supported these findings. This mutant directed efficient replication at ∼60% of WT levels, and its product was found to be initiated at the WT position (−1 relative to the template) with a WT A residue.

We showed that removal of the zinc atom causes dissociation to a monomeric apo-M2-1 species. Surprisingly, the secondary structure and stability of the apo-monomer is indistinguishable from that of the M2-1 tetramer. Dissociation reported by a highly sensitive tryptophan residue is much increased at pH 5.0 compared to pH 7.0, suggesting a histidine protonation cooperating in zinc removal. The monomeric apo form binds RNA at least as well as the tetramer, and this interaction is outcompeted by the phosphoprotein P, the RNA polymerase cofactor. The role of zinc goes beyond stabilization of local structure, finely tuning dissociation to a fully folded and binding competent monomer. Removal of zinc is equivalent to the disruption of the motif by mutation, only that the former is potentially reversible in the cellular context.

These essential residues in F2 are likely involved in triggering and/or refolding of the F protein and, as such, may be ideal targets for antiviral drug development. ABSTRACT The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) protein is a trimeric, membrane-anchored glycoprotein capable of mediating both virus-target cell membrane fusion to initiate infection and cell-cell fusion, even in the absence of the attachment glycoprotein. The F protein is initially expressed in a precursor form, whose functional capabilities are activated by proteolysis at two sites between the F1 and F2 subunits. This cleavage results in expression of the metastable and high-energy prefusion conformation. To mediate fusion, the F protein is triggered by an unknown stimulus, causing the F1 subunit to refold dramatically while F2 changes minimally. Hypothesizing that the most likely site for interaction with a target cell component would be the top, or apex, of the protein, we determined the importance of the residues in the apical loop of F2 by alanine scanning mutagenesis analysis. Five residues were not important, two were of intermediate importance, and all four lysines and one isoleucine were essential. Alanine replacement did not result in the loss of the pre-F conformation for any of these mutants. Each of the four lysines required its specific charge for fusion function. Alanine replacement of the three essential lysines on the ascent to the apex hindered fusion following a forced fusion event, suggesting that these residues are involved in refolding. Alanine mutations at Ile64, also on the ascent to the apex, and Lys75 did not prevent fusion following forced triggering, suggesting that these residues are not involved in refolding and may instead be involved in the natural triggering of the F protein. IMPORTANCE RSV infects virtually every child by the age of 3 years, causing nearly 33 million acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) worldwide each year in children younger than 5 years of age (H. Nair et al., Lancet 375:1545–1555, 2010). RSV is also the second leading cause of respiratory system-related death in the elderly (A. R. Falsey and E. E. Walsh, Drugs Aging 22:577–587, 2005; A. R. Falsey, P. A. Hennessey, M. A. Formica, C. Cox, and E. E. Walsh, N Engl J Med 352:1749–1759, 2005). The monoclonal antibody palivizumab is approved for prophylactic use in some at-risk infants, but healthy infants remain unprotected. Furthermore, its expense limits its use primarily to developed countries. No vaccine or effective small-molecule drug is approved for preventing disease or treating infection (H. M. Costello, W. Ray, S. Chaiwatpongsakorn, and M. E. Peeples, Infect Disord Drug Targets, 12:110–128, 2012).

The 3′ ends of the genome and antigenome, which, respectively, contain the 44-nucleotide (nt) leader (Le) and 155-nt trailer-complement (TrC) regions, should each contain a promoter for RNA replication. The 3′ genome end also should have the promoter for transcription. Substitution for the Le with various lengths of TrC demonstrated that the 3′-terminal 36 nt of TrC are sufficient for extensive (but not maximal) replication and that when juxtaposed with a transcription gene-start (GS) signal, this sequence was also able to direct transcription. It was also shown that the region of Le immediately preceding the GS signal of the first gene could be deleted with either no effect or with a slight decrease in transcription initiation. Thus, the TrC is competent to direct transcription even though it does not do so in nature, and the partial sequence identity it shares with the 3′ end of the genome likely represents the important elements of a conserved promoter active in both replication and transcription. Increasing the length of the introduced TrC sequence incrementally to 147 nt resulted in a fourfold increase in replication and a nearly complete inhibition of transcription. These two effects were unrelated, implying that transcription and replication are not interconvertible processes mediated by a common polymerase, but rather are independent processes. The increase in replication was specific to the TrC sequence, implying the presence of a nonessential, replication-enhancingcis-acting element. In contrast, the inhibitory effect on transcription was due solely to the altered spacing between the 3′ end of the genome and GS signal, which implies that the transcriptase recognizes the first GS signal as a promoter element. Neither the enhancement of replication nor the inhibition of transcription was due to increased base-pairing potential between the 3′ and 5′ ends. The relative strengths of the Le and TrC promoters for directing RNA synthesis were compared and found to be very similar. Thus, these findings highlighted a high degree of functional similarity between the RSV antigenomic and genomic promoters, but provided a further distinction between promoter requirements for transcription and replication.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The TrC is competent to direct transcription even though it does not do so in nature, and the partial sequence identity it shares with the 3′ end of the genome likely represents the important elements of a conserved promoter active in both replication and transcription."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":502,"details":{"paperId":"560531f10cf4d05dfbe4e47ebbcc92801535e3ab","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8310105","DOI":"10.3390/v13071214","CorpusId":"236319986","PubMed":"34372490"},"title":"Functional Features of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus G Protein","abstract":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections in children < 5 years of age worldwide and repeated infections throughout life leading to serious disease in the elderly and persons with compromised immune, cardiac, and pulmonary systems.

Our study provides important information for the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of RSV and host immunity as well as the complicated interplay between the virus and host. ABSTRACT Guanylate binding protein 5 (GBP5) belongs to the GTPase subfamily, which is mainly induced by interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and is involved in many important cellular processes, including inflammasome activation and innate immunity against a wide variety of microbial pathogens. However, it is unknown whether GBP5 inhibits respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. In this study, we identified GBP5 as an effector of the anti-RSV activity of IFN-γ and found that in children, the weaker immune response, especially the weaker IFN-γ response and the decreased GBP5 expression, leads to RSV susceptibility. Furthermore, we revealed that GBP5 reduced the cell-associated levels of the RSV small hydrophobic (SH) protein, which was identified as a viroporin. In contrast, overexpression of the SH protein rescued RSV replication in the presence of GBP5. The GBP5-induced decrease in intracellular SH protein levels is because GBP5 promotes the release of the SH protein into the cell culture. Moreover, the GBP5 C583A mutants with changes at the C terminus or the GBP5 ΔC mutant lacking the C-terminal region, which impairs GBP5 localization in the Golgi, could not inhibit RSV infection, whereas the GTPase-defective GBP5 maintained RSV inhibition, suggesting that Golgi localization but not the GTPase activity of GBP5 is required for RSV inhibition. Interestingly, we found that RSV infection or RSV G protein downregulates GBP5 expression by upregulating DZIP3, an E3 ligase, which induces GBP5 degradation through the K48 ubiquitination and proteasomal pathways. Thus, this study reveals a complicated interplay between host restrictive factor GBP5 and RSV infection and provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of RSV.

We evaluated the importance of sulfation, the major biosynthetic modification of GAGs, using an improved recombinant green fluorescent protein-expressing RSV (rgRSV) to assay infection. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with 50 mM sodium chlorate, a selective inhibitor of sulfation, for 48 h prior to inoculation reduced the efficiency of rgRSV infection to 40%. Infection of a CHO mutant cell line deficient in N-sulfation was three times less efficient than infection of the parental CHO cell line, indicating thatN-sulfation is important. In contrast, infection of a cell line deficient in 2-O-sulfation was as efficient as infection of the parental cell line, indicating that 2-O-sulfation is not required for RSV infection. Incubating RSV with the purified soluble heparin, the prototype GAG, before inoculation had previously been shown to neutralize its infectivity. Here we tested chemically modified heparin chains that lack theirN-, C6-O-, or C2-O-sulfate groups. Only heparin chains lacking the N-sulfate group lost the ability to neutralize infection, confirming thatN-sulfation, but not C6-O- or C2-O-sulfation, is important for RSV infection. Analysis of heparin fragments identified the 10-saccharide chain as the minimum size that can neutralize RSV infectivity. Taken together, these results show that, while sulfate modification is important for the ability of GAGs to mediate RSV infection, only certain sulfate groups are required. This specificity indicates that the role of cell surface GAGs in RSV infection is not based on a simple charge interaction between the virus and sulfate groups but instead involves a specific GAG structural configuration that includes N-sulfate and a minimum of 10 saccharide subunits.

ABSTRACT Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) envelope glycoproteins traffic to assembly sites through the secretory pathway, while nonglycosylated proteins M and N are present in HRSV inclusion bodies but must reach the plasma membrane, where HRSV assembly happens. Little is known about how nonglycosylated HRSV proteins reach assembly sites. Here, we show that HRSV M and N proteins partially colocalize with the Golgi marker giantin, and the glycosylated F and nonglycosylated N proteins are closely located in the trans-Golgi, suggesting their interaction in that compartment. Brefeldin A compromised the trafficking of HRSV F and N proteins and inclusion body sizes, indicating that the Golgi is important for both glycosylated and nonglycosylated HRSV protein traffic. HRSV N and M proteins colocalized and interacted with sorting nexin 2 (SNX2), a retromer component that shapes endosomes in tubular structures. Glycosylated F and nonglycosylated N HRSV proteins are detected in SNX2-laden aggregates with intracellular filaments projecting from their outer surfaces, and VPS26, another retromer component, was also found in inclusion bodies and filament-shaped structures. Similar to SNX2, TGN46 also colocalized with HRSV M and N proteins in filamentous structures at the plasma membrane. Cell fractionation showed enrichment of SNX2 in fractions containing HRSV M and N proteins. Silencing of SNX1 and 2 was associated with reduction in viral proteins, HRSV inclusion body size, syncytium formation, and progeny production.

RSV NS1 and NS2 have been shown to interfere with RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we explored the possibility that NS1 suppresses RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling by targeting TRIM25. Ubiquitination of ectopically expressed RIG-I-2Cards domain was decreased by RSV infection, indicating that RSV possesses ability to inhibit TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Similarly, ectopic expression of NS1 sufficiently suppressed TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Furthermore, interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 was detected by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Further biochemical assays showed that the SPRY domain of TRIM25, which is responsible for interaction with RIG-I, interacted sufficiently with NS1. Suppression of RIG-I ubiquitination by NS1 resulted in decreased interaction between RIG-I and its downstream molecule, MAVS.

However, the mechanisms by which the NS proteins perform this function are unknown. In this study, we focused on defining the mechanism by which NS2 inhibits the induction of IFN transcription. We find that NS2 is required for the early inhibition of IFN transcription since the infection of cells with NS2-deletion RSV resulted in a higher level of IRF3 activation at early time points postinfection compared with that of wt or NS1-deletion RSV infection. In addition, NS2 expression inhibits IFN transcription induced by both the RIG-I and TLR3 pathways. Furthermore, we show that NS2 inhibits RIG-I-mediated IFN promoter activation by binding to the N-terminal CARD of RIG-I and inhibiting its interaction with the downstream component MAVS (IPS-1, VISA, Cardif).

In this investigation, we found that both RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) colocalized with viral genomic RNA and the nucleoprotein (N) as early as 6 h postinfection (hpi). By 12 hpi, MDA5 and MAVS were observed within large viral inclusion bodies (IB). We used a proximity ligation assay (PLA) and determined that the N protein was in close proximity to MDA5 and MAVS in IBs throughout the course of the infection. Similar results were found with the transient coexpression of N and the phosphoprotein (P). Additionally, we demonstrated that the localization of MDA5 and MAVS in IBs inhibited the expression of interferon β mRNA 27-fold following Newcastle disease virus infection. From these data, we concluded that the N likely interacts with MDA5, is in close proximity to MAVS, and localizes these molecules within IBs in order to attenuate the interferon response.

Confocal microscopy revealed that during virus infection, SH seems to accumulate within lipid rafts in the Golgi compartments. Conclusions Upon RSV infection, SH gets localised in the cell membranes and intracellular organelle membranes, and then induces permeability by disrupting membrane architecture, thus leading us to believe that formation of viral ion channels in lipid bilayers of cells is a viral recognition pathway used by the host to signal inflammasome activation.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Upon RSV infection, SH gets localised in the cell membranes and intracellular organelle membranes, and then induces permeability by disrupting membrane architecture, thus leading us to believe that formation of viral ion channels in lipid bilayers of cells is a viral recognition pathway used by the host to signal inflammasome activation."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":143,"details":{"paperId":"9aff9d878e0d3fbba41041d4172b85fe2d92c070","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2369-7","CorpusId":"256822490"},"title":"IGF1R is an entry receptor for respiratory syncytial virus","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A mechanism of RSV entry into cells is shown in which outside-in signalling, involving binding of the prefusion RSV-F glycoprotein with the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, triggers the activation of protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ)."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":324,"details":{"paperId":"7f80a70d4cb3ff2595e38e24cd172ef2dd6efd49","externalIds":{"MAG":"2123144695","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.03666-14","CorpusId":"9318078","PubMed":"25568210"},"title":"Identification and Characterization of the Binding Site of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Phosphoprotein to RNA-Free Nucleoprotein","abstract":"ABSTRACT The RNA genome of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is constitutively encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein N, thus forming a helical nucleocapsid. Polymerization of N along the genomic and antigenomic RNAs is concomitant to replication and requires the preservation of an unassembled monomeric nucleoprotein pool. To this end, and by analogy with Paramyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae, it is expected that the viral phosphoprotein P acts as a chaperone protein, forming a soluble complex with the RNA-free form of N (N0-P complex). Here, we have engineered a mutant form of N that is monomeric, is unable to bind RNA, still interacts with P, and could thus mimic the N0 monomer. We used this N mutant, designated Nmono, as a substitute for N0 in order to characterize the P regions involved in the N0-P complex formation. Using a series of P fragments, we determined by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays that the N and C termini of P are able to interact with Nmono. We analyzed the functional role of amino-terminal residues of P by site-directed mutagenesis, using an RSV polymerase activity assay based on a human RSV minireplicon, and found that several residues were critical for viral RNA synthesis. Using GST pulldown and surface plasmon resonance assays, we showed that these critical residues are involved in the interaction between P[1-40] peptide and Nmono in vitro. Finally, we showed that overexpression of the peptide P[1-29] can inhibit the polymerase activity in the context of the RSV minireplicon, thus demonstrating that targeting the N0-P interaction could constitute a potential antiviral strategy. IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants. Since no vaccine or efficient antiviral treatment is available against RSV, it is essential to better understand how the viral machinery functions in order to develop new antiviral strategies. RSV phosphoprotein P, the main RNA polymerase cofactor, is believed to function as a chaperon protein, maintaining N as a nonassembled, RNA-free protein (N0) competent for RNA encapsidation. In this paper, we provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that the N terminus of P contains a domain that binds specifically to this RNA-free form of N. We further show that overexpression of a small peptide spanning this region of P can inhibit viral RNA synthesis. These findings extend our understanding of the function of RSV RNA polymerase and point to a new target for the development of drugs against this virus.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"There is the first evidence, to the authors' knowledge, that the N terminus of P contains a domain that binds specifically to this RNA-free form of N, and it is shown that overexpression of a small peptide spanning this region of P can inhibit viral RNA synthesis."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":133,"details":{"paperId":"f456c4554cd65263201728394ce2c614dbfe0bb8","externalIds":{"MAG":"2029410145","DOI":"10.1038/mt.2012.237","CorpusId":"205206730","PubMed":"23183536"},"title":"Identification and functional characterization of tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs) in respiratory syncytial virus infection.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study presents novel information on the induction of a functional tRF by viral infection by applying deep sequencing to cells infected with human respiratory syncytial virus, the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":384,"details":{"paperId":"733cd5c1943d881eaed0a07fea2283896fa51671","externalIds":{"MAG":"2143904566","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.77.9.5046-5053.2003","CorpusId":"2499582","PubMed":"12692207"},"title":"Identification of Amino Acids That Are Critical to the Processivity Function of Respiratory Syncytial Virus M2-1 Protein","abstract":"ABSTRACT The M2-1 protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a transcription processivity factor that is essential for virus replication.

RSV strain A2-line19F induces relatively high viral load and mucus in mice. The line 19 fusion (F) protein harbors five unique residues compared to the non-mucus-inducing strains A2 and Long, at positions 79, 191, 357, 371, and 557. We hypothesized that differential fusion activity is a determinant of pathogenesis. In a cell-cell fusion assay, line 19 F was more fusogenic than Long F. We changed the residues unique to line 19 F to the corresponding residues in Long F and identified residues 79 and 191 together as responsible for high fusion activity. Surprisingly, mutation of residues 357 or 357 with 371 resulted in gain of fusion activity. Thus, we generated RSV F mutants with a range of defined fusion activity and engineered these into recombinant viruses. We found a clear, positive correlation between fusion activity and early viral load in mice; however, we did not detect a correlation between viral loads and levels of airway mucin expression. The F mutant with the highest fusion activity, A2-line19F-K357T/Y371N, induced high viral loads, severe lung histopathology, and weight loss but did not induce high levels of airway mucin expression.

The RSV nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) is a multifunctional protein that primarily acts to antagonize the innate immune system by targeting STAT2 for proteasomal degradation. We investigated the structural determinants of NS2 important for interaction with the host ubiquitin system to degrade STAT2 during infection. We found that NS2 expression enhances ubiquitination of host proteins. Bioinformatics analysis provided a platform for identification of specific residues that limit NS2-induced ubiquitination. Combinations of multiple mutations displayed an additive effect on reducing NS2-induced ubiquitination. Using a reverse genetics system, we generated recombinant RSV (rRSV) containing NS2 ubiquitin mutations, which maintained their effect on ubiquitin expression during infection. Interestingly, STAT2 degradation activity was ablated in the NS2 ubiquitin mutant rRSV. In addition, NS2 ubiquitin mutations decreased rRSV replication, indicating a correlation between NS2's ubiquitin function and antagonism of innate immune signaling to enhance viral replication. Our approach of targeting NS2 residues required for NS2 inhibition of immune responses provides a mechanism for attenuating RSV for vaccine development. IMPORTANCE RSV has been circulating globally for more than 60 years, causing severe respiratory disease in pediatric, elderly, and immunocompromised populations. Production of a safe, effective vaccine against RSV is a public health priority. The NS2 protein is an effective target for prevention and treatment of RSV due to its antagonistic activity against the innate immune system. However, NS2-deleted RSV vaccine candidates rendered RSV overattenuated or poorly immunogenic. Alternatively, we can modify essential NS2 structural features to marginally limit viral growth while maintaining immune responses, providing the necessary balance between antigenicity and safety required for an effective vaccine. We coupled bioinformatics analysis with reverse genetics to introduce mutations into RSV's negative-sense genome.

By screening a randomly mutagenized P gene cDNA library, two independent mutations, one with a substitution of glycine at position 172 by serine (G172S) and the other with a substitution of glutamic acid at position 176 by glycine (E176G), were identified to result in the loss of N-P interaction at 37°C in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Both P mutants exhibited greatly reduced activity in supporting the replication and transcription of an RSV minigenome replicon at 37 and 39°C. The G172S and E176G mutations were introduced individually into the RSV A2 (rA2) antigenomic cDNA, and recombinant viruses, rA2-P172 and rA2-P176, were obtained. Both viruses replicate as well as wild-type A2 virus in both Vero and HEp-2 cells at 33°C, but each mutant virus exhibited temperature-sensitive replication in both cell lines. rA2-P176 is more temperature sensitive than rA2-P172. Coimmunoprecipitation of the N protein with each P mutant from virus-infected cells demonstrates that N-P interaction is impaired at 37°C. In addition, the levels of replication of rA2-P172 and rA2-P176 in the lungs of mice and cotton rats were reduced. As is the case with the in vitro assays, rA2-P176 is more restricted in replication in the lower respiratory tract of mice and cotton rats than rA2-P172.

We constructed and rescued a recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing RSV (rgRSV) and used this virus to develop a sensitive system to assess and quantify infection by flow cytometry. Evaluation of a panel of mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that are genetically deficient in various aspects of GAG synthesis showed that infection was reduced up to 80% depending on the type of GAG deficiency.

Blocking experiments in which RSV was preincubated with various soluble GAGs revealed the relative blocking order of: heparin > heparan sulfate > chondroitin sulfate B. Iduronic acid is a component common to these GAGs. GAGs that do not contain iduronic acid, namely, chondroitin sulfate A and C and hyaluronic acid, did not inhibit infection. A role for iduronic acid-containing GAGs in RSV infection was confirmed by the ability of basic fibroblast growth factor to block infection, because basic fibroblast growth factor binds to GAGs containing iduronic acid. Pretreatment of cells with protamine sulfate, which binds and blocks GAGs, also reduced infection. In these examples, infection was reduced by pretreatment of the virus with soluble GAGs, pretreatment of the cells with GAG-binding molecules, pretreatment of the cells with GAG-destroying enzymes or in cells genetically deficient in GAGs.

ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a nonsegmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA virus and shares a similar RNA synthesis strategy with other members of NNS RNA viruses, such as measles, rabies virus, and Ebola virus. RSV RNA synthesis is catalyzed by a multifunctional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which is composed of a large (L) protein that catalyzes three distinct enzymatic functions and an essential coenzyme phosphoprotein (P). Here, we successfully prepared highly pure, full-length, wild-type and mutant RSV polymerase (L-P) complexes. We demonstrated that the RSV polymerase could carry out both de novo and primer-based RNA synthesis. We defined the minimal length of the RNA template for in vitro de novo RNA synthesis using the purified RSV polymerase as 8 nucleotides (nt), shorter than previously reported. We showed that the RSV polymerase catalyzed primer-dependent RNA elongation with different lengths of primers on both short (10-nt) and long (25-nt) RNA templates. We compared the sequence specificity of different viral promoters and identified positions 3, 5, and 8 of the promoter sequence as essential to the in vitro RSV polymerase activity, consistent with the results previously mapped with the in vivo minigenome assay. Overall, these findings agree well with those of previous biochemical studies and extend our understanding of the promoter sequence and the mechanism of RSV RNA synthesis.

According to this model, transcription occurs until sufficient soluble N protein accumulates to initiate encapsidation of the nascent RNA product, which somehow switches the polymerase into a readthrough replicative mode. This model was examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using a reconstituted transcription and RNA replication system that involves a minireplicon and viral proteins that are expressed intracellularly from transfected plasmids. Preliminary experiments showed that reconstituted RNA replication was highly productive, such that on average each molecule of plasmid-supplied minigenome that became encapsidated was amplified 10- to 50-fold. N protein was increased on its own or in concert with the phosphoprotein P and in the presence or absence of the M2 ORF1 transcription elongation factor. The maximum level of N and P protein expression achieved from plasmids equalled or exceeded that obtained in RSV-infected cells. Increased levels of N protein stimulated RNA replication. This is consistent with the idea that RNA replication is dependent on the availability of N protein for encapsidation, which is one postulate of the model. The M2 ORF1 protein had no detectable effect on RNA replication under the various conditions of expression of N and P, which confirmed and extended previous results.

The DNA damage foci contained γH2AFX and TP53BP1, indicative of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and could be reversed by antioxidant treatments such as N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) or reduced glutathione ethyl ester (GSHee).

SH protein has a single α-helical transmembrane (TM) domain that forms pentameric ion channels. Herein, we report the first inhibitor of the SH protein channel, pyronin B, and we have mapped its binding site to a conserved surface of the RSV SH pentamer, at the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain. The validity of the SH protein structural model used has been confirmed by using a bicellar membrane-mimicking environment. However, in bicelles the α-helical stretch of the TM domain extends up to His-51, and by comparison with previous models both His-22 and His-51 adopt an interhelical/lumenal orientation relative to the channel pore. Neither His residue was found to be essential for channel activity although His-51 protonation reduced channel activity at low pH, with His-22 adopting a more structural role. The latter results are in contrast with previous patch clamp data showing channel activation at low pH, which could not be reproduced in the present work. Overall, these results establish a solid ground for future drug development targeting this important viroporin. IMPORTANCE The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is responsible for 64 million reported cases of infection and 160,000 deaths each year. Lack of adequate antivirals fuels the search for new targets for treatment. The small hydrophobic (SH) protein is a 64-amino-acid polypeptide encoded by hRSV and other paramyxoviruses, and its absence leads to viral attenuation in vivo and early apoptosis in infected cells. SH protein forms pentameric ion channels that may constitute novel drug targets, but no inhibitor for this channel activity has been reported so far. A small-molecule inhibitor, pyronin B, can reduce SH channel activity, and its likely binding site on the SH protein channel has been identified. Black lipid membrane (BLM) experiments confirm that protonation of both histidine residues reduces stability and channel activity.

PIK-24, a novel compound designed with phosphoinositide-3 kinase as a target, had potent anti-respiratory syncytial virus activity both in vitro and in vivo. PIK-24 significantly reduced viral entry into the host cell through blocking the late stage of the fusion process. In a mouse model, PIK-24 effectively reduced the viral load and alleviated inflammation in lung tissue. Subsequent studies on the antiviral mechanism of PIK-24 revealed that viral entry was accompanied by phosphoinositide-3 kinase signaling activation, downstream RhoA and cofilin upregulation, and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. PIK-24 treatment significantly reversed all these effects. The disruption of actin cytoskeleton dynamics or the modulation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity by knockdown also affected viral entry efficacy. Altogether, it is reasonable to conclude that the antiviral activity of PIK-24 depends on the phosphoinositide-3 kinase signaling and that the use of phosphoinositide-3 kinase signaling to regulate actin cytoskeleton rearrangement plays a key role in respiratory syncytial virus entry.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"PIK-24, a novel compound designed with phosphoinositide-3 kinase as a target, had potent anti-respiratory syncytial virus activity both in vitro and in vivo and it is reasonable to conclude that the antiviral activity of Pik-24 depends on the phosphoinoskeleton signaling."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":175,"details":{"paperId":"f1f3ce4bd284b507d8c96d441aba04c825b1ad65","externalIds":{"MAG":"2011869970","DOI":"10.1074/jbc.M113.510594","CorpusId":"26541644","PubMed":"24497642"},"title":"Inositol-requiring Enzyme 1 Inhibits Respiratory Syncytial Virus Replication*","abstract":"Background: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections.

While cellular proteins have long been proposed to be involved in the synthesis of HRSV RNA by associating with the polymerase complex, their characterization has been hindered by the difficulty of purifying the viral polymerase from mammalian cell culture. In this study, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged L- and P-protein expression was coupled with high-affinity anti-GFP antibody-based immunoprecipitation and quantitative proteomics to identify cellular proteins that interacted with either the L- or the P-proteins when expressed as part of a biologically active viral RNP. Several core groups of cellular proteins were identified that interacted with each viral protein including, in both cases, protein chaperones. Ablation of chaperone activity by using small-molecule inhibitors confirmed previously reported studies which suggested that this class of proteins acted as positive viral factors. Inhibition of HSP90 chaperone function in the current study showed that HSP90 is critical for L-protein function and stability, whether in the presence or absence of the P-protein. Inhibition studies suggested that HSP70 also disrupts virus biology and might help the polymerase remodel the nucleocapsid to allow RNA synthesis to occur efficiently. This indicated a proviral role for protein chaperones in HRSV replication and demonstrates that the function of cellular proteins can be targeted as potential therapeutics to disrupt virus replication.

ABSTRACT Cellular intrinsic immunity, mediated by the expression of an array of interferon-stimulated antiviral genes, is a vital part of host defense. We have previously used a bioinformatic screen to identify two interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) with poorly characterized function, interferon-induced protein 44 (IFI44) and interferon-induced protein 44-like (IFI44L), as potentially being important in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Using overexpression systems, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout, and a knockout mouse model, we investigated the antiviral capability of these genes in the control of RSV replication. Overexpression of IFI44 or IFI44L was sufficient to restrict RSV infection at an early time postinfection. Knocking out these genes in mammalian airway epithelial cells increased levels of infection. Both genes express antiproliferative factors that have no effect on RSV attachment but reduce RSV replication in a minigenome assay. The loss of Ifi44 was associated with a more severe infection phenotype in a mouse model of infection. These studies demonstrate a function for IFI44 and IFI44L in controlling RSV infection.

One of the recombinant viruses, vF317, expressed F protein (F317) that was processed like the RSV F glycoprotein. F317 was synthesized initially as F0, the uncleaved glycosylated precursor of mature F protein, and formed stable oligomeric structures that were maintained following cleavage of F0 to form the disulphide bond-linked F1 and F2 subunits. Most of the newly synthesized F0 expressed by either RSV or by vF317 was sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H (Endo H). Following cleavage of F0, F1 was resistant to Endo H, suggesting that conversion to complex-type sugars, which takes place in the medial Golgi apparatus, occurred simultaneously with or immediately prior to cleavage of F0 into F1 and F2. Another recombinant virus, vF313, synthesized only uncleaved F protein (F313) that comigrated with F0. Uncleaved F313 was expressed as a stable glycosylated protein; however, unlike cleaved F317, its oligosaccharides were not modified to complex forms, as determined from its Endo H sensitivity, and uncleaved F313 did not assemble into stable oligomeric structures. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA clones encoding F313 and F317 revealed four predicted amino acid sequence differences, none of which were located at the cleavage site. Expression of chimeric F proteins obtained by restriction fragment exchange between the two cDNA clones indicated that two amino acid changes in the F1 domain, located at amino acid residues 301 (Val to Ala) and 447 (Val to Met), resulted in the expression of uncleaved F protein.

Because intrinsic disorder cannot be reduced to a defined atomic structure, we tackled the experimental dissection of the disorder-order transitions of P by a domain fragmentation approach. P remains as a tetramer above 70 °C but shows a pronounced reversible secondary structure transition between 10 and 60 °C. While the N-terminal module behaves as a random coil-like IDP in a manner independent of tetramerization, the isolated C-terminal module displays a cooperative and reversible metastable transition. When linked to the tetramerization domain, the C-terminal module becomes markedly more structured and stable, with strong ANS binding. Therefore, the tertiary structure in the C-terminal module is not compact, conferring \"late\" molten globule-like IDP properties, stabilized by interactions favored by tetramerization. The presence of a folded structure highly sensitive to temperature, reversibly and almost instantly formed and broken, suggests a temperature sensing activity.

We also found that NRAV competed with vesicle protein Rab5c for microRNA miR509-3p in cytoplasm to promote RSV vesicle transport and accelerate RSV proliferation, thereby improving our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of RSV infection. ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped RNA virus which is responsible for approximately 80% of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Current lines of evidence have supported the functional involvement of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in many viral infectious diseases. However, the overall biological effect and clinical role of lncRNAs in RSV infection remain unclear. In this study, lncRNAs related to respiratory virus infection were obtained from the lncRNA database, and we collected 144 clinical sputum specimens to identify lncRNAs related to RSV infection. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection indicated that the expression of lncRNA negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) in RSV-positive patients was significantly lower than that in uninfected patients, but lncRNA psoriasis-associated non-protein coding RNA induced by stress (PRINS), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), and Nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler’s (NeST) showed no difference in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, overexpression of NRAV promoted RSV proliferation in A549 and BEAS-2B cells, and vice versa, indicating that the downregulation of NRAV was part of the host antiviral defense. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed that NRAV was mainly located in the cytoplasm. Through RNA sequencing, we found that Rab5c, which is a vesicle transporting protein, showed the same change trend as NRAV. Subsequent investigation revealed that NRAV was able to favor RSV production indirectly by sponging microRNA miR-509-3p so as to release Rab5c and facilitate vesicle transportation. The study provides a new insight into virus-host interaction through noncoding RNA, which may contribute to exploring potential antivirus targets for respiratory virus.

Our results provide strong evidence that the biogenesis of RSV IBs occurs through liquid-liquid phase transition mediated by N-P interactions. ABSTRACT Infection of host cells by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is characterized by the formation of spherical cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs). These structures, which concentrate all the proteins of the polymerase complex as well as some cellular proteins, were initially considered aggresomes formed by viral dead-end products. However, recent studies revealed that IBs are viral factories where viral RNA synthesis, i.e., replication and transcription, occurs. The analysis of IBs by electron microscopy revealed that they are membrane-less structures, and accumulated data on their structure, organization, and kinetics of formation revealed that IBs share the characteristics of cellular organelles, such as P-bodies or stress granules, suggesting that their morphogenesis depends on a liquid-liquid phase separation mechanism. It was previously shown that expression of the RSV nucleoprotein N and phosphoprotein P of the polymerase complex is sufficient to induce the formation of pseudo-IBs. Here, using a series of truncated P proteins, we identified the domains of P required for IB formation and show that the oligomeric state of N, provided it can interact with RNA, is critical for their morphogenesis. We also show that pseudo-IBs can form in vitro when recombinant N and P proteins are mixed. Finally, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching approaches, we reveal that in cellula and in vitro IBs are liquid organelles. Our results strongly support the liquid-liquid phase separation nature of IBs and pave the way for further characterization of their dynamics.

Thus, the gene-end (GE) signal of M2 lies downstream of the L gene-start (GS) signal, separated by 45 nucleotides. Since RSV transcription ostensibly is sequential and unidirectional from a single promoter within the 3′ leader region, it was unclear how the polymerase accesses the L GS signal. Furthermore, it was previously shown that 90% of transcripts which are initiated at the L GS signal are polyadenylated and terminated at the M2 GE signal, yielding a short, truncated L mRNA as the major transcription product of the L gene. Despite these apparent down-regulatory features, we show that the accumulation of full-length L mRNA during RSV infection is only sixfold less than that of its upstream neighbor, M2. We used cDNA-encoded genome analogs in an intracellular transcription assay to investigate the mechanism of transcription of the overlapped genes. Expression of L was found to be dependent on sequential transcription from the 3′ end of the genome. Apart from the L GS signal, the only other strict requirement for initiation at L was the M2 GE signal. This implies that the polymerase accesses the L GS signal only following arrival at the M2 GE signal. Thus, polymerase which terminates at the M2 GE signal presumably scans upstream to initiate at the L GS signal. This also would provide a mechanism whereby polymerase which terminates prematurely during transcription of L could recycle from the M2 GE signal to the L GS signal, thereby accounting for the unexpectedly high level of synthesis of full-length L mRNA. The sequence and spacing between the two signals were not critical. Furthermore, the polymerase also was capable of efficiently transcribing from an L GS signal placed downstream of the M2 GE signal, implying that the overlapping arrangement is not obligatory. When copies of the L GS signal were placed concurrently upstream and downstream of the M2 GE signal, both were utilized. This finding indicates that a polymerase situated at a GE signal is capable of scanning for a GS signal in either the upstream or downstream direction and thereafter initiating transcription.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This finding indicates that a polymerase situated at a GE signal is capable of scanning for a GS signal in either the upstream or downstream direction and thereafter initiating transcription, thereby accounting for the unexpectedly high level of synthesis of full-length L mRNA."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":127,"details":{"paperId":"ef9a18949db179d4b805842ea56c2d2dca82578e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2067461300","DOI":"10.1021/bi300765c","CorpusId":"28848736","PubMed":"22978633"},"title":"Modular unfolding and dissociation of the human respiratory syncytial virus phosphoprotein p and its interaction with the m(2-1) antiterminator: a singular tetramer-tetramer interface arrangement.","abstract":"Paramyxoviruses share the essential RNA polymerase complex components, namely, the polymerase (L), phosphoprotein (P), and nucleoprotein (N).

The lack of unfolding baseline indicates a native state in conformational exchange and metastable at 20 °C.

Thus, RSV infection led to the activation of NF-κB by a biphasic mechanism: a transient or early activation involving phosphorylation of the inhibitor IκB polypeptides, and a persistent or long-term activation requiring PKC and the generation of hypophosphorylated IκBβ.

This study investigated the effects of HMGB1 on cytokine secretion, as well as the involvement of NF-κB and TLR4 pathways in RSV-induced HMGB1 release in human airway epithelial cells (AECs) and its proinflammatory effects on several human primary immune cells. Purified HMGB1 was incubated with AECs (A549 and small alveolar epithelial cells) and various immune cells and measured the release of proinflammatory mediators and the activation of NF-κB and P38 MAPK. HMGB1 treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of NF-κB and P38 MAPK but did not induce the release of cytokines/chemokines from AECs. However, addition of HMGB1 to immune cells did significantly induce the release of cytokines/chemokines and activated the NF-κB and P38 MAPK pathways. We found that activation of NF-κB accounted for RSV-induced HMGB1 secretion in AECs in a TLR4-dependent manner.

These gene ends contain two conserved regions, a pentanucleotide and a tract of uridylate (U) residues, separated by an A/U-rich central region that is less well conserved. The U tract is thought to be the template for polyadenylation of viral mRNAs by reiterative transcription. The cis-acting requirements for termination were investigated by mutagenesis of the matrix (M) gene end (3′-UCAAUUAUUUUUU-5′) in a dicistronic RNA replicon. Termination efficiencies were quantitated by intracellular metabolic labeling of monocistronic mRNAs and the dicistronic readthrough RNAs that result when termination fails to occur. All three regions of the gene end were necessary for termination. Mutation of each of the first 8 nucleotides of the M gene end to all other nucleotides showed that nucleotides 2 to 6 were important for termination and intolerant of change, whereas nucleotides 1 and 7 were tolerant of change. At position 8, A or U allowed termination, but G or C did not. Both the length and the position of the U tract were important for termination. U residues at positions 9 to 12 were necessary, while additional U residues at position 8, and especially position 13, enhanced termination efficiency. Altering the length of the central region abolished termination, suggesting that the position of the U tract with respect to the 3′-UCAAU-5′ sequence was critical. The termination efficiencies of each of the 10 genes of RS virus are different. Since transcription is obligatorily sequential and termination of each gene is required for transcription of the next gene downstream, these differences may contribute to gene regulation.

In this study, the role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) CRV was evaluated using single amino acid substitutions and a small molecule inhibitor called BI-D. Effects were analyzed using cell-based minigenome and in vitro biochemical assays. Several amino acid substitutions inhibited production of capped, full-length mRNA and instead resulted in accumulation of short transcripts of approximately 40 nucleotides in length, confirming that RSV CRV has a role in capping. In addition, all six variants tested were either partially or completely defective in RNA replication. This was due to an inability of the polymerase to efficiently elongate the RNA within the promoter region. BI-D also inhibited transcription and replication. In this case, polymerase elongation activity within the promoter region was enhanced, such that the small RNA transcribed from the promoter was not released and instead was elongated past the first gene start signal. This was accompanied by a decrease in mRNA initiation at the first gene start signal and accumulation of aberrant RNAs of varying length.

During transfection and two serial passages, the various miniantigenomes were essentially indistinguishable with regard to the efficiency of transcription, RNA replication, and packaging into transmissible particles. Progeny minigenomes of six different mutants were recovered postpassage, copied into cDNA, cloned, and sequenced completely. The length of each of these RNAs was found to have remained unchanged during replication and passage. Thus, RSV transcription and replication appear to lack the requirement that the template length be an even multiple of an integer such as six, which for Sendai and measles viruses is obligatory for nucleocapsid function. Each of the in vitro-synthesized miniantigenomes used in transfection contained a nonviral extension of three nucleotides, GGG, on the 5' (leader) end contributed by the T7 promoter. The termini of the recovered minigenomes were examined for five mutants by RNA circularization followed by cDNA synthesis, amplification, cloning, and sequencing. Unexpectedly, each recovered minigenome contained the complement of this nonviral extension on the 3' (leader) end, showing that it had been faithfully copied and maintained during RNA replication and passage. The nonviral trinucleotide did not appear to affect the activity of the template.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"RSV transcription and replication appear to lack the requirement that the template length be an even multiple of an integer such as six, which for Sendai and measles viruses is obligatory for nucleocapsid function."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":342,"details":{"paperId":"4f16a608c080ff85af9db2c6e75805747f05e0fb","externalIds":{"MAG":"1553990265","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.69.9.5677-5686.1995","CorpusId":"11967198","PubMed":"7637014"},"title":"RNA replication by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is directed by the N, P, and L proteins; transcription also occurs under these conditions but requires RSV superinfection for efficient synthesis of full-length mRNA","abstract":"Previously, a cDNA was constructed so that transcription by T7 RNA polymerase yielded a approximately 1-kb negative-sense analog of genomic RNA of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) containing the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under the control of putative RSV transcription motifs and flanked by the RSV genomic termini. When transfected into RSV-infected cells, this minigenome was \"rescued,\" as evidenced by high levels of CAT expression and the production of transmissible particles which propagated and expressed high levels of CAT expression during serial passage (P.L. Collins, M. A. Mink, and D. S. Stec, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:9663-9667, 1991). Here, this cDNA, together with a second one designed to yield an exact-copy positive-sense RSV-CAT RNA antigenome, were each modified to contain a self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme for the generation of a nearly exact 3' end. Each cDNA was transfected into cells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing T7 RNA polymerase, together with plasmids encoding the RSV N, P, and L proteins, each under the control of a T7 promoter.

When the plasmid-supplied template was the minigenome, the products were mini-antigenome, subgenomic polyadenylated mRNA and progeny minigenome. Identification of progeny minigenome made from the plasmid-supplied minigenome template indicates that the full RSV RNA replication cycle occurred. RNA synthesis required all three RSV proteins, N, P, and L, and was ablated completely by the substitution of Asn for Asp at position 989 in the L protein. Thus, the N, P, and L proteins were sufficient for the synthesis of correct minigenome and antigenome, but this was not the case for subgenomic mRNA, indicating that the requirements for RNA replication and transcription are not identical. Complementation with N, P, and L alone yielded an mRNA pattern containing a large fraction of molecules of incomplete, heterogeneous size. In contrast, complementation with RSV (supplying all of the RSV gene products) yielded a single discrete mRNA band. Superinfection with RSV of cells staging N/P/L-based RNA synthesis yielded the single discrete mRNA species.

Host innate and acquired immune responses activated following RSV infection have been suspected to contribute to RSV disease. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate innate and acquired immunity and are candidates for playing key roles in the host immune response to RSV. Leukocytes express TLRs, including TLR2, TLR6, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7, that can interact with RSV and promote immune responses following infection. Using knockout mice, we have demonstrated that TLR2 and TLR6 signaling in leukocytes can activate innate immunity against RSV by promoting tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and CCL5 (RANTES).

ABSTRACT The limited antiviral options and lack of an effective vaccine against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) highlight the need for a novel antiviral therapy. One alternative is to identify and target the host factors required for viral infection. Here, using RNA interference to knock down Rab proteins, we provide multiple lines of evidence that Rab5a is required for RSV infection: (i) Rab5a is upregulated both in RSV A2-infected A549 cells and RSV A2-challenged BALB/c mouse airway epithelial cells at early infection phase; (ii) short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of Rab5a is associated with reduced lung pathology in RSV A2-challenged mice; (iii) Rab5a expression is correlated with disease severity of RSV infection of infants.

The RSV attachment glycoprotein (G) is not required for infection, as G-null RSV replicates efficiently in several cell lines. Our laboratory previously reported that the viral fusion (F) protein is a determinant of strain-dependent pathogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that virus dependence on G is determined by the strain specificity of F. We generated recombinant viruses expressing G and F, or null for G, from the laboratory A2 strain (Katushka RSV-A2GA2F [kRSV-A2GA2F] and kRSV-GstopA2F) or the clinical isolate A2001/2-20 (kRSV-2-20G2-20F and kRSV-Gstop2-20F). We quantified the virus cell binding, entry kinetics, infectivity, and growth kinetics of these four recombinant viruses in vitro. RSV expressing the 2-20 G protein exhibited the greatest binding activity. Compared to the parental viruses expressing G and F, removal of 2-20 G had more deleterious effects on binding, entry, infectivity, and growth than removal of A2 G. Overall, RSV expressing 2-20 F had a high dependence on G for binding, entry, and infection. IMPORTANCE RSV is the leading cause of childhood acute respiratory disease requiring hospitalization. As with other paramyxoviruses, two major RSV surface viral glycoproteins, the G attachment protein and the F fusion protein, mediate virus binding and subsequent membrane fusion, respectively. Previous work on the RSV A2 prototypical strain demonstrated that the G protein is functionally dispensable for in vitro replication. This is in contrast to other paramyxoviruses that require attachment protein function as a prerequisite for fusion. We reevaluated this requirement for RSV using G and F proteins from clinical isolate 2-20. Compared to the laboratory A2 strain, the G protein from 2-20 had greater contributions to virus binding, entry, infectivity, and in vitro growth kinetics. Thus, the clinical isolate 2-20 F protein function depended more on its G protein, suggesting that RSV has a higher dependence on G than previously thought.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The clinical isolate 2-20 F protein function depended more on its G protein, suggesting that RSV has a higher dependence on G than previously thought."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":438,"details":{"paperId":"6a968a1367365addddde11f8a42f8cb873278ba7","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4102526","MAG":"2037036613","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102368","CorpusId":"18559313","PubMed":"25033192"},"title":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Can Infect Basal Cells and Alter Human Airway Epithelial Differentiation","abstract":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing severe respiratory illness in infants and immune compromised patients.

Using either mechanical or chemical injury models, we have demonstrated a robust RSV infection of p63+ basal cells in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, proliferating basal cells in 2D culture were also susceptible to RSV infection. We therefore tested the hypothesis that RSV infection of this progenitor cell would influence the differentiation status of the airway epithelium. RSV infection of basal cells on the day of seeding (MOI≤0.0001), resulted in the formation of an epithelium that showed a profound loss of ciliated cells and gain of secretory cells as assessed by acetylated α-tubulin and MUC5AC/MUC5B immunostaining, respectively. The mechanism driving the switch in epithelial phenotype is in part driven by the induced type I and type III interferon response that we demonstrate is triggered early following RSV infection. Neutralization of this response attenuates the RSV-induced loss of ciliated cells. Together, these data show that through infection of proliferating airway basal cells, RSV has the potential to influence the cellular composition of the airway epithelium.

The domain responsible for translocation was then mapped. Unlike most other virus envelope proteins, F is unusual since the target signal is not contained within the cytoplasmic domain nor did it involve fatty acid modified residues.

Thus, neither DC- nor L-SIGN represents a functional receptor for RSV. However, inhibition of these interactions increased DC activation, as evidenced by significantly higher levels of alpha interferon (IFN-α), MIP-1α, and MIP-1β in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) exposed to RSV after neutralization of DC-and L-SIGN. To understand the molecular interactions involved, intracellular signaling events triggered by purified RSV G glycoprotein were examined in DC- and L-SIGN-transfected 3T3 cells.

The host antiviral response to RSV acts via retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). We show here that RSV infection upregulates major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression through the induction of NLRC5, a NOD-like, CARD domain-containing intracellular protein that has recently been identified as a class I MHC transactivator (CITA). RSV infection of A549 cells promotes upregulation of NLRC5 via beta interferon (IFN-β) production, since the NLRC5-inducing activity in a conditioned medium from RSV-infected A549 cells was removed by antibody to IFN-β, but not by antibody to IFN-γ. RSV infection resulted in RIG-I upregulation and induction of NLRC5 and MHC-I. Suppression of RIG-I induction significantly blocked NLRC5, as well as MHC-I, upregulation and diminished IRF3 activation. Importantly, Vero cells deficient in interferon production still upregulated MHC-I following introduction of the RSV genome by infection or transfection, further supporting a key role for RIG-I. A model is therefore proposed in which the host upregulates MHC-I expression during RSV infection directly via the induction of RIG-I and NLRC5 expression. Since elevated expression of MHC-I molecules can sensitize host cells to T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity or immunopathologic damage, the results have significant implications for the modification of immunity in RSV disease. IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide. Infection early in life is linked to persistent wheezing and allergic asthma in later life, possibly related to upregulation of major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) on the cell surface, which facilitates cytotoxic T cell activation and antiviral immunity. Here, we show that RSV infection of lung epithelial cells induces expression of RIG-I, resulting in induction of a class I MHC transactivator, NLRC5, and subsequent upregulation of MHC-I. Suppression of RIG-I induction blocked RSV-induced NLRC5 expression and MHC-I upregulation. Increased MHC-I expression may exacerbate the RSV disease condition due to immunopathologic damage, linking the innate immune response to RSV disease.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that RSV infection of lung epithelial cells induces expression of RIG-I, resulting in induction of a class I MHC transactivator, NLRC5, and subsequent upregulation of MHC-I."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":373,"details":{"paperId":"94b5dd556afaeb337fc4a4157a0ad7628faaab63","externalIds":{"MAG":"2066243349","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.76.11.5654-5666.2002","CorpusId":"14343238","PubMed":"11991994"},"title":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection of Human Airway Epithelial Cells Is Polarized, Specific to Ciliated Cells, and without Obvious Cytopathology","abstract":"ABSTRACT Gene therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease requires efficient gene transfer to airway epithelial cells after intralumenal delivery.

Analyses of the cell types infected by RSV revealed that lumenal columnar cells, specifically ciliated epithelial cells, were targeted by RSV and that cultures became susceptible to infection as they differentiated into a ciliated phenotype. In addition to infection of ciliated cells via the apical membrane, RSV was shed exclusively from the apical surface and spread to neighboring ciliated cells by the motion of the cilial beat. Gross histological examination of cultures infected with RSV revealed no evidence of obvious cytopathology, suggesting that RSV infection in the absence of an immune response can be tolerated for >3 months. Therefore, rgRSV efficiently transduced the airway epithelium via the lumenal surface and specifically targeted ciliated airway epithelial cells.

This study evaluates the role of PI 3-K and its downstream mediators in apoptosis and inflammatory gene induction during RSV infection of airway epithelial cells. Whereas RSV infection alone did not produce significant cytotoxicity until 24–48 h following infection, simultaneous RSV infection and exposure to LY294002, a blocker of PI 3-K activity, resulted in cytotoxicity within 12 h.

The activation of PI 3-K by RSV and its inhibition by LY294002 was confirmed in direct PI 3-K activity assays.

The M2-1 protein has a Cys3His1 zinc binding motif which is essential for function, is phosphorylated, and has been shown to interact with the RS virus nucleocapsid (N) protein. In the work reported here, we determined the sites at which the M2-1 protein was phosphorylated and investigated the importance of these phosphorylated residues for M2-1 function in transcription. By combining protease digestion, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the phosphorylated residues as serines 58 and 61, not threonine 56 and serine 58 as previously reported. Serines 58 and 61 and the surrounding amino acids are in a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by casein kinase I. Consistent with this, we showed that the unphosphorylated M2-1 protein synthesized in Escherichia coli could be phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase I. The effect of eliminating phosphorylation by site-specific mutagenesis of serines 58 and 61 on the function of the M2-1 protein in transcription of RS virus subgenomic replicons was assayed.

Future studies to identify the specific kinase(s) that phosphorylates these residues can lead to kinase inhibitors and antiviral drugs for this important human pathogen. ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus in the family Pneumoviridae and genus Orthopneumovirus that can cause severe disease in infants, immunocompromised adults, and the elderly. The RSV viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp) complex is composed of the phosphoprotein (P) and the large polymerase protein (L). The P protein is constitutively phosphorylated by host kinases and has 41 serine (S) and threonine (T) residues as potential phosphorylation sites. To identify important phosphorylation residues in the P protein, we systematically and individually mutated all S and T residues to alanine (A) and analyzed their effects on genome transcription and replication by using a minigenome system. We found that the mutation of eight residues resulted in minigenome activity significantly lower than that of wild-type (WT) P. We then incorporated these mutations (T210A, S203A, T151A, S156A, T160A, S23A, T188A, and T105A) into full-length genome cDNA to rescue recombinant RSV. We were able to recover four recombinant viruses (with T151A, S156A, T160A, or S23A), suggesting that RSV-P residues T210, S203, T188, and T105 are essential for viral RNA replication. Among the four recombinant viruses rescued, rRSV-T160A caused a minor growth defect relative to its parental virus while rRSV-S156A had severely restricted replication due to decreased levels of genomic RNA. During infection, P-S156A phosphorylation was decreased, and when passaged, the S156A virus acquired a known compensatory mutation in L (L795I) that enhanced both WT-P and P-S156A minigenome activity and was able to partially rescue the S156A viral growth defect. This work demonstrates that residues T210, S203, T188, and T105 are critical for RSV replication and that S156 plays a critical role in viral RNA synthesis.

We confirm that both bRSV and human RSV viral RNA replication takes place in these inclusion bodies, likely meaning these organelles are a functionally conserved feature of this group of viruses (the orthopneumoviruses). Importantly, we also showed that these organelles are able to capture important innate immune transcription factors (in this case NF-KB), blocking the normal signaling processes that tell the nucleus the cell is infected, which may help us to understand how these viruses cause disease. ABSTRACT Viruses routinely employ strategies to prevent the activation of innate immune signaling in infected cells. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is no exception, as it encodes two accessory proteins (NS1 and NS2) which are well established to block interferon signaling. However, RSV-encoded mechanisms for inhibiting NF-κB signaling are less well characterized. In this study, we identified RSV-mediated antagonism of this pathway, independent of the NS1 and NS2 proteins and indeed distinct from other known viral mechanisms of NF-κB inhibition. In both human and bovine RSV-infected cells, we demonstrated that the p65 subunit of NF-κB is rerouted to perinuclear puncta in the cytoplasm, which are synonymous with viral inclusion bodies (IBs), the site for viral RNA replication. Captured p65 was unable to translocate to the nucleus or transactivate a NF-κB reporter following tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) stimulation, confirming the immune-antagonistic nature of this sequestration. Subsequently, we used correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) to colocalize the RSV N protein and p65 within bovine RSV (bRSV) IBs, which are granular, membraneless regions of cytoplasm with liquid organelle-like properties. Additional characterization of bRSV IBs indicated that although they are likely formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), they have a differential sensitivity to hypotonic shock proportional to their size. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism for viral antagonism of innate immune signaling which relies on sequestration of the NF-κB subunit p65 to a biomolecular condensate—a mechanism conserved across the Orthopneumovirus genus and not host-cell specific. More generally, they provide additional evidence that RNA virus IBs are important immunomodulatory complexes within infected cells.

The exacerbated production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the airways in response to RSV is an important pillar in the development of these pathologies. As such, a keen understanding of the mechanisms that modulate the inflammatory response during RSV infection is of pivotal importance to developing effective treatment. The NF-κB transcription factor is a major regulator of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes. However, RSV-mediated activation of NF-κB is far from characterized. We recently demonstrated that aside from the well-characterized IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 is an essential event regulating the RSV-mediated NF-κB-dependent promoter transactivation. In the present study, using small interfering RNA and pharmacological inhibitors, we now demonstrate that RSV sensing by the RIG-I cytoplasmic receptor triggers a signaling cascade involving the MAVS and TRAF6 adaptors that ultimately leads to p65ser536 phosphorylation by the IKKβ kinase. In a previous study, we highlighted a critical role of the NOX2-containing NADPH oxidase enzyme as an upstream regulator of both the IκBαSer32 and p65Ser536 in human airway epithelial cells. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of NOX2 significantly decreases IKKβ activation. Taken together, our data identify a new RIG-I/MAVS/TRAF6/IKKβ/p65Ser536 pathway placed under the control of NOX2, thus characterizing a novel regulatory pathway involved in NF-κB-driven proinflammatory response in the context of RSV infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that RSV sensing by the RIG-I cytoplasmic receptor triggers a signaling cascade involving the MAVS and TRAF6 adaptors that ultimately leads to p65ser536 phosphorylation by the IKKβ kinase, thus characterizing a novel regulatory pathway involved in NF-κB-driven proinflammatory response in the context of RSV infection."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":297,"details":{"paperId":"5da3e64a4cdd42bf37f365759059eac1b90f688f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2767754527","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.01302-17","CorpusId":"4867300","PubMed":"29118126"},"title":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Targeting the G Protein Provides a New Approach for an Old Problem","abstract":"ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) annually affecting >2 million children in the United States <5 years old.

There is no approved RSV vaccine, and treatments are limited. Recently, a phase 3 trial in the elderly using a recombinant RSV F protein vaccine failed to meet its efficacy objectives, namely, prevention of moderate-to-severe RSV-associated LRTI and reduced incidence of acute respiratory disease. Moreover, a recent phase 3 trial evaluating suptavumab (REGN2222), an antibody to RSV F protein, did not meet its primary endpoint of preventing medically attended RSV infections in preterm infants. Despite these setbacks, numerous efforts targeting the RSV F protein with vaccines, antibodies, and small molecules continue based on the commercial success of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the RSV F protein (palivizumab).

This analysis revealed that M2-1 interacts specifically with positive sense RSV RNA, but not negative sense genome RNA.

Recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that RSV infection can prevent T cell activation, a phenomenon attributed in part to cytokines and chemokines secreted by RSV-infected cells. Efficient immunity against viruses is promoted by dendritic cells (DCs), professional antigen-presenting cells, that prime antigen-specific helper and cytotoxic T cells. Therefore, it would be to the advantage of RSV to impair DC function and prevent the induction of T cell immunity.

Inhibition of T cell activation by RSV was observed independently of the type of TCR ligand on the DC surface and applied to cognate-, allo-, and superantigen stimulation. As a result of exposure to RSV-infected DCs, T cells became unresponsive to subsequent TCR engagement.

As a first line of defense against respiratory infections, innate immune responses, including the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs), play an important role. Upon infection with RSV, multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize RSV-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mount innate immune responses. Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) have been identified as important innate receptors to mount type I IFNs during RSV infection. However, type I IFN levels remain surprisingly low during RSV infection despite strong viral replication. The poor induction of type I IFNs can be attributed to the cooperative activity of 2 unique, nonstructural (NS) proteins of RSV, i.e., NS1 and NS2. These viral proteins have been shown to suppress both the production and signaling of type I and III IFNs by counteracting a plethora of key host innate signaling proteins. Moreover, increasing numbers of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are being identified as targets of the NS proteins in recent years, highlighting an underexplored protein family in the identification of NS target proteins. To understand the diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2, Goswami and colleagues proposed the hypothesis of the NS degradasome (NSD) complex, a multiprotein complex made up of, at least, NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, the crystal structure of NS1 was resolved recently and, remarkably, identified NS1 as a structural paralogue of the RSV matrix protein. Unfortunately, no structural data on NS2 have been published so far. In this review, we briefly describe the PRRs that mount innate immune responses upon RSV infection and provide an overview of the various effector functions of NS1 and NS2.

The viral glycoprotein G binds to GAGs and was thought to be the viral attachment protein, but more recently virus lacking the G protein was shown to be infectious in cell culture. We have compared the GAG dependence of a recombinant, green fluorescent protein-expressing virus containing the F protein as its only viral glycoprotein (rgRSV-F) to isogenic complete virus containing all three viral glycoproteins (rgRSV-SGF). Attachment and infection by each virus was found to be largely dependent on cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) based on the finding that both activities were inhibited by preincubation of virus with soluble HS, by removal of HS from target cells by enzymatic treatment or mutation, or by pretreatment of the target cells with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which binds HS. These results, coupled with the previous finding that SH is not involved in virion binding (S. Techaarpornkul, N. Barretto, and M. Peeples, 2001, J. Virol. 75, 6825-6834), suggest that, in the context of the virion, both the G and F proteins bind to HS. Interestingly, both rgRSV-F and rgRSV-SGF retained significant binding activity and infectivity despite these treatments, suggesting an alternate productive attachment and infection pathway. This property of GAG independence was particularly apparent for rgRSV-F virions, which retained nearly half of its attachment and infection activities in most of these experiments. Comparison of the attachment and infection activities of rgRSV-SGF and rgRSV-F virions with a Chinese hamster ovary cell line and a derivative thereof that is defective in GAG synthesis indicated that approximately 50% of rgRSV-SGF attachment is due to G protein-GAG binding, 25% to F protein-GAG binding, and 25% to an independent pathway. This alternative pathway presumably is mediated by the sole remaining viral surface protein, F, although the formal possibility exists that some other virion-associated protein is involved.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Compared with a recombinant, green fluorescent protein-expressing virus containing the F protein as its only viral glycoprotein, both the G and F proteins bind to HS, suggesting an alternate productive attachment and infection pathway in the context of the virion."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":151,"details":{"paperId":"caad0169ab3f9230183c75f36e81e42b02de95eb","externalIds":{"MAG":"1997527149","DOI":"10.1053/JINF.2002.1015","CorpusId":"21339621","PubMed":"12217726"},"title":"Respiratory syncytial virus--viral biology and the host response.","abstract":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of respiratory tract infection in infants.

RSV infection of HEp-2 cells induces the activation of RhoA, a small GTPase. We therefore asked whether RhoA signaling is important for RSV replication or syncytium formation. The treatment of HEp-2 cells with Clostridium botulinum C3, an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates and specifically inactivates RhoA, inhibited RSV-induced syncytium formation and cell-to-cell fusion, although similar levels of PFU were released into the medium and viral protein expression levels were equivalent. Treatment with another inhibitor of RhoA signaling, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, yielded similar results. Scanning electron microscopy of C3-treated infected cells showed reduced numbers of single blunted filaments, in contrast to the large clumps of long filaments in untreated infected cells. These data suggest that RhoA signaling is associated with filamentous virus morphology, cell-to-cell fusion, and syncytium formation but is dispensable for the efficient infection and production of infectious virus in vitro. Next, we developed a semiquantitative method to measure spherical and filamentous virus particles by using sucrose gradient velocity sedimentation. Fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the separation of spherical and filamentous forms of infectious virus into two identifiable peaks. The C3 treatment of RSV-infected cells resulted in a shift to relatively more spherical virions than those from untreated cells.

The contributions of these effects to RSV sequential transcription were investigated with minigenomes which contained one to five genes which were either foreign marker genes or authentic RSV genes. When evaluated on a promoter-proximal gene, the effect of M2-1 on the synthesis of full-length mRNA was much greater for a long (1,212- or 1,780-nucleotide) gene (up to a 615-fold increase) than for a short (274-nucleotide) gene (less than a 2-fold increase). This was independent of whether the gene contained non-RSV or RSV-specific sequence. Once the polymerase had terminated prematurely, it was unable to reinitiate at a downstream gene. These studies also confirmed that M2-1 enhances the synthesis of polycistronic mRNAs and that the magnitude of this effect varied greatly among different naturally occurring gene junctions. The synthesis of polycistronic mRNAs, which presumably involves antitermination at the gene-end signal, required a higher level of M2-1 than did the synthesis of the corresponding monocistronic mRNAs. M2-1 did not have a comparable antitermination effect at the junction between the leader region and the first gene. In a minigenome containing the NS1 and NS2 genes in their authentic sequence context, synthesis of full-length NS1 and NS2 mRNAs in the absence of M2-1 was remarkably high (36 and 57%, respectively, of the maximum levels observed in the presence of M2-1). In contrast, synthesis of mRNA from additional downstream genes was highly dependent on M2-1. Thus, RSV has the potential for two transcription programs: one in the absence of M2-1, in which only the NS1 and NS2 genes are transcribed, and one in the presence of M2-1, in which sequential transcription of the complete genome occurs. The dependence on M2-1 for transcription was greater for a gene in the fifth position from the promoter than for one in the third position. This indicates that under conditions where M2-1 is limiting, its concentration affects the gradient of transcription. Although M2-1 was found to have profound effects on transcription, it had no effect on replication of any minigenome tested, suggesting that it is not an active participant in RNA replication or regulation of RNA replication. Finally, since a permissive RSV infection is marked by a gradual increase in the intracellular accumulation of viral proteins including M2-1, we examined the relative abundances of various mRNAs during RSV infection for evidence of temporal regulation of transcription. None was found, implying that the availability of M2-1 during a permissive infection is sufficient at all times such that its concentration does not mediate temporal regulation of gene transcription.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Although M2-1 was found to have profound effects on transcription, it had no effect on replication of any minigenome tested, suggesting that it is not an active participant in RNA replication or regulation of RNA replication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":475,"details":{"paperId":"3088aaedef9164b562bbe45f522ddbb6e532e42a","externalIds":{"MAG":"3147748326","DOI":"10.26502/ACBR.50170159","CorpusId":"234161042"},"title":"Roles of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Proteins in Immune Responses","abstract":"Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) has evaded active vaccination or effective antiviral therapy for decades and continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization in infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised worldwide.

This aggregation apparently occurs by interaction of the fusion peptides of F(TM-) molecules that are exposed after cleavage. Since exposure of the fusion peptide is a key event in the process of membrane fusion, changes associated with F(TM-) cleavage may reflect those occurring in full-length F during membrane fusion. Deletions or substitutions that changed either the length, charge or hydrophobicity of the fusion peptide inhibited aggregation of F(TM-), and these mutants remained as unaggregated cones after cleavage. In contrast, more conservative changes did not inhibit the change of shape and aggregation of F(TM-).

Although the molecular mechanism of this extrinsic functional mode of the RSV G glycoprotein (G protein) remains undetermined, G proteins may neutralize the fusion glycoprotein function that promotes IFN-mediated mDC modulation via TLR4 and may cause insufficient raising cell-mediated immunity against RSV.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"G proteins may neutralize the fusion glycoprotein function that promotes IFN-mediated mDC modulation via TLR4 and may cause insufficient raising cell-mediated immunity against RSV."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":308,"details":{"paperId":"d859f0aa423aad4abbeee3a7cb078abe1664b714","externalIds":{"MAG":"2133134586","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.01813-10","CorpusId":"7097869","PubMed":"21307202"},"title":"Soluble Respiratory Syncytial Virus Fusion Protein in the Fully Cleaved, Pretriggered State Is Triggered by Exposure to Low-Molarity Buffer","abstract":"ABSTRACT The paramyxovirus fusion (F) glycoprotein is anchored in the virion membrane in a metastable, pretriggered form. Once triggered, the F protein undergoes a dramatic conformational extension that inserts its hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, then folds back on itself to bring the membranes together and initiate fusion. Unlike most other paramyxoviruses, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein alone is sufficient to mediate membrane fusion and virus infection. To study the triggering mechanism of the RSV F protein, we have generated a soluble F (sF) protein by replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains with a 6His tag. The sF protein is secreted efficiently from 293T cells in a fully cleaved form. It is recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, appears spherical by electron microscopic analysis, and is not aggregated, all consistent with a native, pretriggered trimer. The sF protein was purified on a Ni+2 column and eluted with 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole. Dialysis against 10 mM buffer caused the sF protein to trigger, forming “hat pin”-shaped molecules that aggregated as rosettes, characteristic of the posttriggered form. Further dialysis experiments indicated that the efficiency of triggering correlated well with the reduction of buffer molarity. Reduction of buffer molarity by dilution also resulted in exposure of the fusion peptide, as detected by liposome association, confirming sF protein triggering. Mutation of the furin cleavage site adjacent to the fusion peptide prevented liposome association, further confirming that association is via the fusion peptide.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":23,"details":{"paperId":"876353f51b5c3409a763ee9862747466e87bf2da","externalIds":{"MAG":"2043021763","DOI":"10.1006/VIRO.2002.1540","CorpusId":"25372054","PubMed":"12350355"},"title":"Sorting of the respiratory syncytial virus matrix protein into detergent-resistant structures is dependent on cell-surface expression of the glycoproteins.","abstract":"The interaction of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Matrix (M) protein with the plasma membrane was investigated using polyclonal and monoclonal antisera raised against recombinant M expressed in bacteria.

There are many open questions regarding the processes that regulate human RSV (hRSV) assembly and budding. Here, using cryo-electron tomography, we identified virus particles that were spherical, filamentous, and asymmetric in structure, all within the same virus preparation. The three particle morphologies maintained a similar organization of the surface glycoproteins, matrix protein (M), M2-1, and the ribonucleoprotein (RNP). RNP filaments were traced in three dimensions (3D), and their total length was calculated. The measurements revealed the inclusion of multiple full-length genome copies per particle. RNP was associated with the membrane whenever the M layer was present. The amount of M coverage ranged from 24% to 86% in the different morphologies. Using fluorescence light microscopy (fLM), direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), and a proximity ligation assay (PLA), we provide evidence illustrating that M2-1 is located between RNP and M in isolated viral particles. In addition, regular spacing of the M2-1 densities was resolved when hRSV viruses were imaged using Zernike phase contrast (ZPC) cryo-electron tomography.

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) inhibits host interferon (IFN) responses stimulated by RSV infection by targeting early steps in the IFN-signaling pathway. But the molecular mechanisms related to how NS2 regulates these processes remain incompletely understood. To address this gap, here we solved the X-ray crystal structure of NS2. This structure revealed a unique fold that is distinct from other known viral IFN antagonists, including RSV NS1. We also show that NS2 directly interacts with an inactive conformation of the RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and MDA5. NS2 binding prevents RLR ubiquitination, a process critical for prolonged activation of downstream signaling.

Single mutations of these residues disrupted specifically either P or RNA binding to M2-1 in vitro. M2-1 recruitment to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which are regarded as sites of viral RNA synthesis, was impaired by mutations affecting only binding to P, but not to RNA, suggesting that M2-1 is associated to the holonucleocapsid by interacting with P. These results reveal that RNA and P binding to M2-1 can be uncoupled and that both are critical for the transcriptional antitermination function of M2-1.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The NMR structure of the RSV M2-158–177 core domain is reported, which is structurally homologous to the C-terminal domain of Ebola virus VP30, a transcription co-factor sharing functional similarity with M1-1."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":334,"details":{"paperId":"99e8bd40c7ba445e2042515ec40d08ac1d13df55","externalIds":{"MAG":"1583974749","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.63.11.4767-4776.1989","CorpusId":"22176194","PubMed":"2677404"},"title":"Structure and cell surface maturation of the attachment glycoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus in a cell line deficient in O glycosylation","abstract":"The synthesis of the extensively O-glycosylated attachment protein, G, of human respiratory syncytial virus and its expression on the cell surface were examined in a mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, ldlD, which has a defect in protein O glycosylation.

A recombinant vaccinia virus expression vector for the G protein was constructed which, as well as containing the human respiratory syncytial virus G gene, contained a portion of the cowpox virus genome that circumvents the normal host range restriction of vaccinia virus in CHO cells. The recombinant vector expressed high levels of G protein in both mutant ldlD and wild-type CHO cells. Several immature forms of the G protein were identified that contained exclusively N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Metabolic pulse-chase studies indicated that the pathway of maturation for the G protein proceeds from synthesis of the 32-kilodalton (kDa) polypeptide accompanied by cotranslational attachment of high-mannose N-linked sugars to form an intermediate with an apparent mass of 45 kDa. This step is followed by the Golgi-associated conversion of the N-linked sugars to the complex type and the completion of the O-linked oligosaccharides to achieve the mature 90-kDa form of G. Maturation from the 45-kDa N-linked form to the mature 90-kDa form occurred only in the presence of O-linked sugar addition, confirming that O-linked oligosaccharides constitute a significant proportion of the mass of the mature G protein. In the absence of O glycosylation, forms of G bearing galactose-deficient truncated N-linked and fully mature N-linked oligosaccharides were observed. The effects of N- and O-linked sugar addition on the transport of G to the cell surface were measured.

The induction of poor T-cell immunological memory causes a high susceptibility to reinfections, which contributes to hRSV spread. Previously, we showed that hRSV inhibits T-cell activation by impairing the assembly of the dendritic cell (DC)−T-cell immunological synapse (IS). Here, we show that the nucleoprotein (N) of hRSV—a canonical cytosolic protein—is expressed on the surface of infected DCs. Further, using the supported-lipid-bilayer system (that mimics the DC/ antigen-presenting cells-membrane composition), we observed that the hRSV N interfered with pMHC−T-cell receptor interactions and inhibited IS assembly. We conclude that hRSV N may therefore be instrumental in impairing the host immune response during infection with this virus. Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children worldwide. The recurrent hRSV outbreaks and reinfections are the cause of a significant public health burden and associate with an inefficient antiviral immunity, even after disease resolution. Although several mouse- and human cell-based studies have shown that hRSV infection prevents naïve T-cell activation by antigen-presenting cells, the mechanism underlying such inhibition remains unknown. Here, we show that the hRSV nucleoprotein (N) could be at least partially responsible for inhibiting T-cell activation during infection by this virus. Early after infection, the N protein was expressed on the surface of epithelial and dendritic cells, after interacting with trans-Golgi and lysosomal compartments. Further, experiments on supported lipid bilayers loaded with peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes showed that surface-anchored N protein prevented immunological synapse assembly by naive CD4+ T cells and, to a lesser extent, by antigen-experienced T-cell blasts. Synapse assembly inhibition was in part due to reduced T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and pMHC clustering at the T-cell−bilayer interface, suggesting that N protein interferes with pMHC−TCR interactions. Moreover, N protein colocalized with the TCR independently of pMHC, consistent with a possible interaction with TCR complex components. Based on these data, we conclude that hRSV N protein expression at the surface of infected cells inhibits T-cell activation.

No vaccines against this virus are currently available. RSV infection of a cell is initiated by fusion between the virion membrane and a cellular membrane, but it is not clear if the fusion process takes place at the plasma membrane or within an endosome. Most such experiments have been initiated at the traditional synchronization temperature of 4°C, an abnormal temperature for animal cells and one at which cellular homeostasis may be negatively affected. We have compared two synchronization temperatures (4°C and 22°C) to determine the kinetics of RSV entry into human bronchial epithelial cells. Following inoculation, virus entry was halted at different times by the addition of neutralizing antibody or temperature reduction to 4°C. We engineered a virus that encodes an extra viral gene, beta-lactamase fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P), to enable rapid detection after infection initiation. We found that the synchronization temperature used during inoculation determines the site of fusion. Transition from 4°C to 37°C resulted in RSV entry via the endosomal pathway but also induced F-actin disruption and plasma membrane blebbing, whether the cells were inoculated with RSV or not. Transition from 22°C to 37°C resulted in RSV entry by fusion at the plasma membrane and without the F-actin and plasma membrane disruptions. These results suggest that RSV normally enters cells by fusion at the plasma membrane and that the induction of endocytosis by infection synchronization at 4°C may be an artefact caused by distortion of the plasma membrane-supporting cytoskeleton. Author Summary In order to understand the overall mechanism driving infection, it is important to determine how the virus enters cells. The pathway that RSV uses to infect cells is unclear. It is a common practice to attach the virions at 4°C to synchronize the viral infection. In this report, we found that warming up primary cultures of undifferentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells to 37°C from 4°C triggered dramatic changes in their cell membrane and cytoskeleton totally unrelated to the presence of the virions. The assessment of viral content delivery to the cytoplasm using RSV engineered to express BlaM allowed us to find that the virions attached at 4°C or 22°C fused their envelope with endosome or plasma membrane, respectively. Consequently, the entry via endosome after attachment at 4°C is an experimental artefact and RSV infects by fusing its envelope with the plasma membrane.

Most of the naturally occurring differences in the GE signals of the various RSV genes occur in the \"middle\" and \"poly(U)\" regions. We mutated a copy of the fusion protein (F) GE signal that was positioned at the end of the promoter-proximal gene of a tricistronic minigenome and evaluated the effect of these mutations on RSV transcription in a plasmid-initiated, intracellular assay. Mutations confirmed the importance of the middle region's AU-rich nature and 3-nt length, and the poly(U) tract's 4-nt minimum functional length, with maximal termination efficiency observed at five U residues. Nt assignments other than U at position 13 also affected the efficiency of termination, showing that this position is part of the functional 13-nt GE signal. These results indicate that differences in nt assignments in the middle and poly(U) regions of the GE signal, which occur frequently in nature, affect the efficiency of termination. Unexpectedly, the ability of certain mutations to inhibit termination was completely dependent on coexpression of the M2-1 protein, and in many other cases the inhibitory effect of the mutation was greatly enhanced in the presence of M2-1. Thus, M2-1 appears to have the effect of altering the polymerase such that it ignores suboptimal GE signals.

ABSTRACT It was shown previously that the matrix (M), phosphoprotein (P), and fusion (F) proteins of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are sufficient to produce virus-like particles (VLPs) that resemble the RSV infection-induced virions. However, the exact mechanism and interactions among the three proteins are not known. This work examines the interaction between P and M during RSV assembly and budding. We show that M interacts with P in the absence of other viral proteins in cells by using a split Nano luciferase assay. By using recombinant proteins, we demonstrate a direct interaction between M and P. By using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we identify three novel M interaction sites on P, namely, site I in the αN2 region, site II in the 115 to 125 region, and the oligomerization domain (OD). We show that the OD, and likely the tetrameric structural organization of P, is required for virus-like filament formation and VLP release. Although sites I and II are not required for VLP formation, they appear to modulate P levels in RSV VLPs.

It is a major unmet target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. The lack of knowledge of the RSV budding mechanism presents a continuing challenge for virus-like particle (VLP) production for vaccine purposes.

The four species of 1A were: (i) the previously described, nonglycosylated 7.5-kDa species that appeared to be the full-length, unmodified 1A protein; (ii) a nonglycosylated 4.8-kDa species that was carboxy-coterminal with the 7.5-kDa species and might be generated by translational initiation at the second AUG in the sequence; (iii) a 13- to 15-kDa species that contained one or two N-linked carbohydrate side chains of the high-mannose type; and (iv) a 21- to 30-kDa glycosylated species that appeared to be generated from the 13- to 15-kDa species by further modification of the N-linked carbohydrate. All four forms of the 1A protein were synthesized and processed on intracellular membranes, and several lines of biochemical evidence showed that all four species were integral membrane proteins. Thus, the 1A protein is a third RSV integral membrane protein and is present as such in both glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. With the use of antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide representing the C terminus of the 1A protein, indirect immunofluorescence showed that the 1A protein was expressed at the cell surface. Antibody-antigen complexes formed at the surface of intact infected cells were immunoprecipitated, showing that the 7.5-kDa, 13- to 15-kDa, and 21- to 30-kDa, but not the 4.8-kDa, species, were accessible to extracellular antibodies. Thus, the 1A protein is a candidate to be a viral surface antigen. The small size, gene map location integral membrane association, and cell surface expression of the 1A protein strongly suggested that it is a counterpart to the SH protein that has been described for simian virus type 5.

Although we and others recently showed that G is not essential for replication in vitro, it does affect the efficiency of replication in a cell type-dependent fashion and is required for efficient replication in vivo. The ectodomain of G is composed of two heavily glycosylated domains with mucin-like characteristics that are separated by a short central region that is relatively devoid of glycosylation sites. This central region contains a 13-amino acid segment that is conserved in the same form among RSV isolates and is overlapped by a second segment containing four cysteine residues whose spacings are conserved in the same form and which create a cystine noose. The conserved nature of the cystine noose and flanking 13-amino acid segment suggested that this region likely was important for attachment activity. To test this hypothesis, we constructed recombinant RSVs from which the region containing the cysteine residues was deleted together with part or all of the conserved 13-amino acid segment. Surprisingly, each deletion had little or no effect on the intracellular synthesis and processing of the G protein, the kinetics or efficiency of virus replication in vitro, or sensitivity to neutralization by soluble heparin in vitro. In addition, neither deletion had any discernible effect on the ability of RSV to infect the upper respiratory tract of mice and both resulted in a 3- to 10-fold reduction in the lower respiratory tract.

Many of these proteins share a fold comprising a trimer of antiparallel coiled-coil heterodimers, where the heterodimers are formed by two discontinuous heptad repeat motifs within the proteolytically processed chain. The F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; the major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants) contains two corresponding regions that are predicted to form coiled coils (HR1 and HR2), together with a third predicted heptad repeat (HR3) located in a nonhomologous position. In order to probe the structures of these three domains and ascertain the nature of the interactions between them, we have studied the isolated HR1, HR2, and HR3 domains of RSV F by using a range of biophysical techniques, including circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and sedimentation equilibrium. HR1 forms a symmetrical, trimeric coiled coil in solution (K 3 ≈ 2.2 × 1011 M−2) which interacts with HR2 to form a 3:3 hexamer. The HR1-HR2 interaction domains have been mapped using limited proteolysis, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and electrospray-mass spectrometry. HR2 in isolation exists as a largely unstructured monomer, although it exhibits a tendency to form aggregates with β-sheet-like characteristics. Only a small increase in α-helical content was observed upon the formation of the hexamer. This suggests that the RSV F glycoprotein contains a domain that closely resembles the core structure of the simian parainfluenza virus 5 fusion protein (K. A. Baker, R. E. Dutch, R. A. Lamb, and T. S. Jardetzky, Mol. Cell 3:309–319, 1999). Finally, HR3 forms weak α-helical homodimers that do not appear to interact with HR1, HR2, or the HR1-HR2 complex.

ORF1 encodes a 22-kDa protein termed M2-1. The M2-1 protein contains a Cys3-His1 motif (C-X7-C-X5-C-X3-H) near the amino terminus. This motif is conserved in all human, bovine, and ovine strains of RS virus. A similar motif found in the mammalian transcription factor Nup475 has been shown to bind zinc. The M2-1 protein of human RS virus functions as a transcription factor which increases polymerase processivity, and it enhances readthrough of intergenic junctions during RS virus transcription, thereby acting as a transcription antiterminator. The M2-1 protein also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein. We examined the effects of mutations of cysteine and histidine residues predicted to coordinate zinc in the Cys3-His1 motif on transcription antitermination and N protein binding. We found that mutating the predicted zinc-coordinating residues, the cysteine residues at amino acid positions 7 and 15 and the histidine residue at position 25, prevented M2-1 from enhancing transcriptional readthrough. In contrast, mutations of amino acids within this motif not predicted to coordinate zinc had no effect. Mutations of the predicted zinc-coordinating residues in the Cys3-His1 motif also prevented M2-1 from interacting with the nucleocapsid protein. One mutation of a noncoordinating residue in the motif which did not affect readthrough during transcription, E10G, prevented interaction with the nucleocapsid protein. This suggests that M2-1 does not require interaction with the nucleocapsid protein in order to function during transcription. Analysis of the M2-1 protein in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed two major forms distinguished by their mobilities. The slower migrating form was shown to be phosphorylated, whereas the faster migrating form was not.

The effect of the F protein modifications was then examined in the context of a viral infection in standard cell types (Vero and HEp-2).

A monoclonal antibody directed against F protein inhibited apoptosis and was also effective if administered to A549 lung epithelial cells postinfection. F protein expression in epithelial cells caused phosphorylation of tumor suppressor p53 at serine 15, activation of p53 transcriptional activity, and conformational activation of proapoptotic Bax.

The efficiency of encapsidation of the plasmid-derived minigenome was not altered by coexpression of NS1, indicating that the inhibition occurs at a later step. In two different dicistronic minigenomes, transcription of each gene was equally sensitive to inhibition by NS1. This suggested that the gradient of transcriptional polarity was unaffected and that the effect of NS1 instead probably involves an early event such as polymerase entry on the genome.

However, two transitions were observed in the chemical perturbation of NS1SOs: the first, from 2.0 to 3.0 M of denaturant, corresponds to a conformational transition and dissociation of the oligomers to the native monomer, indicating a substantial energy barrier. The second transition (2.0 to 3.5 M denaturant) corresponds to full unfolding of the native NS1 monomer. In addition, different cosolvent perturbations converged on the formation of ß-sheet enriched soluble oligomeric species, with secondary structure resembling those obtained after mild temperature treatment.

Two CT regions with impact on infectious progeny production were identified: residues 557 to 566 (CT-R1) and 569 to 572 (CT-R2). Substitutions in CT-R1 decreased infectivity by 40 to 85% and increased the level of F-induced cell-cell fusion but had little impact on assembly of viral surface filaments, which are believed to be virions. Substitutions in CT-R2, as well as deletion of the entire CT, abrogated infectious progeny production and impaired viral filament formation. However, CT-R2 mutations did not block but rather delayed the formation of viral filaments, which continued to form at a low rate and contained the viral M protein and nucleoprotein (N). Microscopy analysis revealed that substitutions in CT-R2 but not CT-R1 led to accumulation of M and F proteins within and at the perimeter of viral inclusion bodies (IBs), respectively. The accumulation of M and F at IBs and coincident strong decrease in filament formation and infectivity upon CT-R2 mutations suggest that F interaction with IBs is an important step in the virion assembly process and that CT residues 569 to 572 act to facilitate release of M-ribonucleoprotein complexes from IBs.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A complementation assay was developed to systematically examine the role of the F protein CT in infectious virus production and suggested that F interaction with IBs is an important step in the virion assembly process and that CT residues 569 to 572 act to facilitate release of M-ribonucleoprotein complexes from IBs."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":298,"details":{"paperId":"5934674f07df36a91356f2b260a2c841611d7391","externalIds":{"MAG":"1979400047","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.01347-13","CorpusId":"37712763","PubMed":"23843644"},"title":"The Respiratory Syncytial Virus Fusion Protein and Neutrophils Mediate the Airway Mucin Response to Pathogenic Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection","abstract":"ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of death due to a viral etiology in infants.

During infection, M2-2 has been described as the polymerase cofactor responsible for promoting genome replication. This function was first inferred by infection with a mutant virus lacking the M2-2 ORF, in which viral genome presented delayed accumulation in comparison to wild-type virus. In accordance with this phenotype, it has been recently shown that M2-2 promotes changes in interactions between the polymerase and other viral proteins at early stages of infection. Despite its well-explored role in the regulation of the polymerase activity, little has been made to investigate the relationship of M2-2 with cellular proteins. In fact, a previous report showed poor recruitment of M2-2 to viral structures, with the protein being mainly localized to the nucleus and cytoplasmic granules. To unravel which other functions M2-2 exerts during infection, we expressed the protein in HEK293T cells and performed proteomic analysis of co-immunoprecipitated partners, identifying enrichment of proteins involved with regulation of translation, protein folding and mRNA splicing. In approaches based on these data, we found that M2-2 expression downregulates eiF2α phosphorylation and inhibits stress granules assembly under arsenite induction. In addition, we also verified that M2-2 inhibits translation initiation, and is targeted for proteasome degradation, being localized to granules composed by defective ribosomal products at the cytoplasm. These results suggest that besides its functions in the regulation of genome replication, M2-2 may exert additional functions to contribute to successful RSV infection.

Although this virus is an important pathogen responsible for respiratory infections in immunocompromised individuals, currently there are no vaccines or effective treatments to inhibit its infection. Our findings showed that the protein M2-2 interferes with protein synthesis, being able to downregulate the assembly of stress granules during stress stimuli. Besides, we verified the relationship between M2-2 and the proteasome machinery, which is responsible for protein degradation and is also involved with protein synthesis.

Specific inhibition of Crm1-mediated nuclear export by leptomycin B increased M nuclear accumulation. Analysis of truncated and point-mutated M derivatives indicated that Crm1-dependent nuclear export of M is attributable to a nuclear export signal (NES) within residues 194 to 206. Importantly, inhibition of M nuclear export resulted in reduced virus production, and a recombinant RSV carrying a mutated NES could not be rescued by reverse genetics. That this is likely to be due to the inability of a nuclear export deficient M to localize to regions of virus assembly is indicated by the fact that a nuclear-export-deficient GFP-M fails to localize to regions of virus assembly when expressed in cells infected with wild-type RSV.

For human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), VLP assembly is poorly understood and appears inefficient. Hence, hRSV antigens are often incorporated into foreign VLP systems to generate anti-RSV vaccine candidates. To better understand the assembly, and ultimately to enable efficient production, of authentic hRSV VLPs, we examined the associated requirements and mechanisms. In a previous analysis in HEp-2 cells, the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), and fusion protein (F) were required for formation of filamentous VLPs, which, similar to those of wild-type virus, were associated with the cell surface. Using fluorescence and electron microscopy combined with immunogold labeling, we examined the surfaces of transfected HEp-2 cells and further dissected the process of filamentous VLP formation. Our results show that N is not required. Coexpression of P plus M plus F, but not P plus M, M plus F, or P plus F, induced both viral protein coalescence and formation of filamentous VLPs that resembled wild-type virions. Despite suboptimal coalescence in the absence of P, the M and F proteins, when coexpressed, formed cell surface-associated filaments with abnormal morphology, appearing longer and thinner than wild-type virions. For F, only the carboxy terminus (Fstem) was required, and addition of foreign protein sequences to Fstem allowed incorporation into VLPs. Together, the data show that P, M, and the F carboxy terminus are sufficient for robust viral protein coalescence and filamentous VLP formation and suggest that M-F interaction drives viral filament formation, with P acting as a type of cofactor facilitating the process and exerting control over particle morphology.

Among the potential anti-hRSV approaches are virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines, which, based on resemblance to virus or viral components, can induce protective immunity. For hRSV, few reports are available concerning authentic VLP production or testing, in large part because VLP production is inefficient and the mechanisms underlying particle assembly are poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of the cell-associated nature of RSV particles and used high-resolution microscopy analyses to examine the viral proteins required for formation of wild-type-virus-resembling VLPs, the contributions of these proteins to morphology, and the domains involved in incorporation of the antigenically important viral F protein.

We investigated whether sG might act as a decoy for neutralizing antibodies by comparing the in vitro neutralization of wild-type (wt) RSV versus recombinant mG RSV expressing only mG. wt RSV indeed was less susceptible than mG RSV to monovalent G-specific and polyvalent RSV-specific antibodies, whereas susceptibility to F-specific antibodies was equivalent. This difference disappeared when the virus preparations were purified to remove sG. Thus, sG appears to function as a neutralization decoy. We evaluated this effect in vivo in mice by comparing the effects of passively transferred antibodies on the pulmonary replication of wt RSV versus mG RSV. Again, wt RSV was less sensitive than mG RSV to G-specific and RSV-specific antibodies; however, a similar difference was also observed with F-specific antibodies. This confirmed that sG helps wt RSV evade the antibody-dependent restriction of replication but indicated that in mice, it is not acting primarily as a decoy for G-specific antibodies, perhaps because sG is produced in insufficient quantities in this poorly permissive animal. Rather, we found that the greater sensitivity of mG versus wt RSV to the antiviral effect of passively transferred RSV antibodies required the presence of inflammatory cells in the lung and was Fcγ receptor dependent.

The absence of small hydrophobic (SH) protein in RSV leads to viral attenuation. Results: SH protein forms pentamers and shows pH-dependent ion channel activity. Conclusion: SH protein forms pentameric ion channels. Significance: The SH protein and its channel activity constitute a potential drug target. The small hydrophobic (SH) protein is encoded by the human respiratory syncytial virus. Its absence leads to viral attenuation in the context of whole organisms, and it prevents apoptosis in infected cells. Herein, we have examined the structure of SH protein in detergent micelles and in lipid bilayers, by solution NMR and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. We found that SH protein has a single α-helical transmembrane domain and forms homopentamers in several detergents. In detergent micelles, the transmembrane domain is flanked N-terminally by an α-helix that forms a ring around the lumen of the pore and C-terminally by an extended β-turn. SH protein was found in the plasma membrane of transiently expressing HEK 293 cells, which showed pH-dependent (acid-activated) channel activity. Channel activity was abolished in mutants lacking both native His residues, His22 and His51, but not when either His was present. Herein, we propose that the pentameric model of SH protein presented is a physiologically relevant conformation, albeit probably not the only one, in which SH contributes to RSV infection and replication. Viroporins are short (∼100 amino acids) viral membrane proteins that form oligomers of a defined size, act as proton or ion channels, and in general enhance membrane permeability in the host. However, with some exceptions, their precise biological role of their channel activity is not understood. In general, viroporins resemble poorly specialized proteins but are nevertheless critical for viral fitness. In vivo, viruses lacking viroporins usually exhibit an attenuated or weakened phenotype, altered tropism, and diminished pathological effects. We have chosen to study the SH protein, 64 amino acids long, found in the human respiratory syncytial virus because of the effect of RSV on human health and the lack of adequate antivirals. We show that SH protein forms oligomers that behave as ion channels when activated at low pH. This study adds SH protein to a growing group of viroporins that have been structurally characterized.

ABSTRACT Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a negative-stranded RNA virus that causes a globally prevalent respiratory infection, which can cause life-threatening illness, particularly in the young, elderly, and immunocompromised. HRSV multiplication depends on replication and transcription of the HRSV genes by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). For replication, this complex comprises the phosphoprotein (P) and the large protein (L), whereas for transcription, the M2-1 protein is also required. M2-1 is recruited to the RdRp by interaction with P and also interacts with RNA at overlapping binding sites on the M2-1 surface, such that binding of these partners is mutually exclusive. The molecular basis for the transcriptional requirement of M2-1 is unclear, as is the consequence of competition between P and RNA for M2-1 binding, which is likely a critical step in the transcription mechanism. Here, we report the crystal structure at 2.4 Å of M2-1 bound to the P interaction domain, which comprises P residues 90 to 110. The P90–110 peptide is alpha helical, and its position on the surface of M2-1 defines the orientation of the three transcriptase components within the complex. The M2-1/P interface includes ionic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and the critical contribution of these contacts to complex formation was assessed using a minigenome assay. The affinity of M2-1 for RNA and P ligands was quantified using fluorescence anisotropy, which showed high-affinity RNAs could outcompete P. This has important implications for the mechanism of transcription, particularly the events surrounding transcription termination and synthesis of poly(A) sequences.

The RSV matrix (M) protein plays key roles in virus assembly and budding, but the protein interactions that govern budding of infectious virus are not known. In this study, we focus on M protein and identify a key phosphorylation site (Thr205) in M that is critical for RSV infectious virus production. Recombinant virus with a nonphosphorylatable alanine (Ala) residue at the site was markedly attenuated, whereas virus with a phosphomimetic aspartate (Asp) resulted in a nonviable virus which could only be recovered with an additional mutation in M (serine to asparagine at position 220), strongly implying that Thr205 is critical for viral infectivity. Experiments in vitro showed that mutation of Thr205 does not affect M stability or the ability to form dimers but implicate an effect on higher-order oligomer assembly. In transfected and infected cells, Asp substitution of Thr205 appeared to impair M oligomerization; typical filamentous structures still formed at the plasma membrane, but M assembly during the ensuing elongation process seemed to be impaired, resulting in shorter and more branched filaments as observed using electron microscopy (EM). Our data thus imply for the first time that M oligomerization, regulated by a negative charge at Thr205, may be critical to production of infectious RSV. IMPORTANCE We show here for the first time that RSV M's role in virus assembly/release is strongly dependent on threonine 205 (Thr205), a consensus site for CK2, which appears to play a key regulatory role in modulating M oligomerization and association with virus filaments.

To gain insight into virus-host interactions, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen. The expression of over 20,000 cellular genes was individually knocked down in human airway epithelial A549 cells, followed by infection with RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Knockdown of expression of the cellular ATP1A1 protein, which is the major subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase of the plasma membrane, had one of the strongest inhibitory effects on GFP expression and viral titer. Inhibition was not observed for vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that it was RSV-specific rather than a general effect. ATP1A1 formed clusters in the plasma membrane very early following RSV infection, which was independent of replication but dependent on the attachment glycoprotein G. RSV also triggered activation of ATP1A1, resulting in signaling by c-Src-kinase activity that transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by Tyr845 phosphorylation. ATP1A1 signaling and activation of both c-Src and EGFR were found to be required for efficient RSV uptake. Signaling events downstream of EGFR culminated in the formation of macropinosomes. There was extensive uptake of RSV virions into macropinosomes at the beginning of infection, suggesting that this is a major route of RSV uptake, with fusion presumably occurring in the macropinosomes rather than at the plasma membrane. Important findings were validated in primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC). In A549 cells and HSAEC, RSV uptake could be inhibited by the cardiotonic steroid ouabain and the digitoxigenin derivative PST2238 (rostafuroxin) that bind specifically to the ATP1A1 extracellular domain and block RSV-triggered EGFR Tyr845 phosphorylation.

The RSV attachment (G) glycoprotein in virions produced by HEp-2 cells is a highly glycosylated 95 kDa protein with a 32 kDa peptide core. However, virions produced in HBE cultures, RSV (HBE), contain an even larger, 170 kDa, G protein (LgG). Here we show that LgG is found in virions from both subgroups A and B lab-adapted and clinical isolates. Unexpectedly, RSV (HBE) virions were approximately 100-fold more infectious for HBE cultures than for HEp-2 cells. Surprisingly, the cause of this differential infectivity, was reduced infectivity of RSV (HBE) on HEp-2 cells rather than enhanced infectivity on HBE cultures. The lower infectivity of RSV(HBE) for HEp-2 cells is caused by the reduced ability of LgG to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), the RSV receptor on HEp-2 cells.

The MTase-CTD of Mononegavirales forms a clamp to accommodate RNA that is subsequently methylated on the cap structure and depending on the virus, on internal positions. These enzymatic activities are essential for efficient viral mRNA translation into proteins, and to prevent the recognition of uncapped viral RNA by innate immunity sensors.

This analysis showed that a large proportion of the SH protein exhibited detergent-solubility characteristics that were consistent with an association with lipid-raft membranes. Analysis of virus-infected cells by immuno-transmission electron microscopy revealed SH protein clusters on the cell surface, but only very low levels of the protein appeared to be associated with mature virus filaments and inclusion bodies. These data suggest that during virus infection, the compartments in the secretory pathway, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex, are major sites of accumulation of the SH protein.

These foreign ORFs were flanked by the RSV gene-start (GS) and gene-end (GE) transcription signals and separated by the naturally occurring G/F intergenic region. The RSV-CAT-LUC minigenome was synthesized in vitro and transfected into RSV-infected cells, and synthesis of the CAT and LUC mRNAs was monitored by enzyme assay and Northern (RNA) blot hybridization. Surprisingly, substitution of each of the other naturally occurring RSV intergenic regions in turn did not significantly alter the absolute or relative amounts of the two mRNAs. Substitution of a nonnatural 10-nucleotide intergenic region, or elimination of the intergenic region altogether, also had little effect on the level of expression of the two genes. Four of the minigenome variants containing naturally occurring intergenic regions were modified further by replacing part of the LUC ORF with a second copy of the CAT ORF, so that each of the two mRNAs would hybridize equally with a CAT-specific probe and their relative molar amounts could be determined. The level of expression of the downstream gene was 0.30 to 0.36 that of the upstream one. This determined the magnitude of RSV transcriptional polarity across a gene pair and confirmed that this value was very similar among the various intergenic regions. Minigenome transcription also yielded a CAT-LUC readthrough mRNA at a level 0.10 to 0.13 that of the LUC mRNA.

At a higher level, coexpression of the M2 gene inhibited transcription and RNA replication. The M2 mRNA contains two overlapping translational open reading frames (ORFs), which were segregated for further analysis.
