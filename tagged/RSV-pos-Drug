CONTEXT: Palivizumab prophylaxis is used as passive immunization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, because of its high cost, the value of this intervention is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis in infants <24 months of age. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to August 2018. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently screened results to include economic evaluations conducted between 2000 and 2018 from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted outcomes. Quality appraisal was completed by using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. Costs were adjusted to 2017 US dollars. RESULTS: We identified 28 economic evaluations (20 cost-utility analyses and 8 cost-effectiveness analyses); most were from the United States (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). Study quality was high; 23 studies met >80% of the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Palivizumab prophylaxis ranged from a dominant strategy to having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2 526 203 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) depending on study perspective and targeted population. From the payer perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for preterm infants (29–35 weeks’ gestational age) was between $5188 and $791 265 per QALY, with 90% of estimates <$50 000 per QALY. Influential parameters were RSV hospitalization reduction rates, palivizumab cost, and discount rate. LIMITATIONS: Model design heterogeneity, model parameters, and study settings were barriers to definitive conclusions on palivizumab’s economic value. CONCLUSIONS: Palivizumab as RSV prophylaxis was considered cost-effective in prematurely born infants, infants with lung complications, and infants from remote communities.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Palivizumab as RSV prophylaxis was considered cost-effective in prematurely born infants, infants with lung complications, and infants from remote communities."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":186,"details":{"paperId":"2ba968dea9349f112c75df965540d92886389ccb","externalIds":{"MAG":"2900694504","DOI":"10.1080/14712598.2018.1544239","CorpusId":"53304125","PubMed":"30426788"},"title":"Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine: where are we now and what comes next?","abstract":"ABSTRACT Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and elderly and to date, there is no safe or effective vaccine against RSV. Areas Covered: This review provides a roadmap to RSV vaccine development. It is a journey spanning over more than half a century from the initial disappointment with inactivated formalin vaccine to the current advancements in vaccine technology. We highlight the important aspects of RSV structural biology and protective immune response. We include discussion of newer fusion glycoprotein immune targets and current vaccine candidates. We used Pub Med and Medline resources for literature search. Expert opinion: A resurgence of information on the burden related to RSV infection coupled with the newer understanding of the molecular mechanism of RSV infection has reignited a tremendous activity in RSV vaccine discovery. The vaccine pipeline is diverse and target populations are varied, thus making the goal of a safe and effective RSV vaccine in the future within reach.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review provides a roadmap to RSV vaccine development, highlighting the important aspects of RSV structural biology and protective immune response and including discussion of newer fusion glycoprotein immune targets and current vaccine candidates."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":123,"details":{"paperId":"5443869dbe5aff104cb8749996bc0c5608adeabd","externalIds":{"MAG":"2900396794","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01361","CorpusId":"53243639","PubMed":"30411898"},"title":"State of the Art in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Drug Discovery and Development.","abstract":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent viral infection with limited treatment options which hospitalizes millions each year. Treatment options have been limited to palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, approved for prophylaxis in high-risk infants and ribavirin with very limited efficacy and significant safety concerns. This Perspective surveys the range of direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that target key steps in the viral life cycle. A number of approaches to DAAs have produced landmark clinical studies over the past few years, notably in fusion and nucleoside inhibitors, and an update of the clinical status of these compounds is provided. Non-nucleoside inhibitors of replication are reviewed in addition to inhibitors of other mechanisms, notably the RSV N and G proteins. This article will provide an informative perspective of the current status of drug discovery targeted at providing an effective therapy for RSV infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An informative perspective of the current status of drug discovery targeted at providing an effective therapy for RSV infection is provided."}},"tag":"DRUG"}]
