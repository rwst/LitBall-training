A principle of rotavirus pathogenesis has been that the infection remains localized to epithelial cells in the small intestine. This dogma was challenged by recent findings of rotavirus in the serum of experimentally infected animals and children with diarrhea. Repeated associations of rotavirus infections with a wide range of nongastroenteric clinical manifestations in humans were considered spurious because of lack of proof that rotavirus escaped the intestine. New data outlined in this review, however, show that rotavirus routinely infects systemically and highlight controversies and future research questions. Recent findings Rotavirus antigens (antigenemia), RNA, or infectious virus (viremia) has been demonstrated in the serum and many extraintestinal tissues in all experimental animal models. Rotavirus antigens and RNA have been detected in the sera of children with rotavirus diarrhea. The tissues and cell types that support rotavirus replication outside the intestine and the consequences of extraintestinal reservoirs of infection are beginning to be examined. Summary Rotavirus infection is systemic, with an acute active viremia and extraintestinal replication. The impact of systemic rotavirus on disease burden remains to be determined.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Rotavirus infection is systemic, with an acute active viremia and extraintestinal replication and the impact of systemic rotavirus on disease burden remains to be determined."}},"tag":"OTHER"},{"id":544,"details":{"paperId":"cb8d87b09ddc6507c2eaf4d0bf8c1f2069d5d372","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7819889","DOI":"10.3389/fcimb.2020.586751","CorpusId":"231148663","PubMed":"33489932"},"title":"The Complex Interactions Between Rotavirus and the Gut Microbiota","abstract":"Human rotavirus (HRV) is the leading worldwide cause of acute diarrhea-related death in children under the age of five. RV infects the small intestine, an important site of colonization by the microbiota, and studies over the past decade have begun to reveal a complex set of interactions between RV and the gut microbiota. RV infection can temporarily alter the composition of the gut microbiota and probiotic administration alleviates some symptoms of infection in vivo, suggesting reciprocal effects between the virus and the gut microbiota. While development of effective RV vaccines has offered significant protection against RV-associated mortality, vaccine effectiveness in low-income countries has been limited, potentially due to regional differences in the gut microbiota. In this mini review, we briefly detail research findings to date related to HRV vaccine cohorts, studies of natural infection, explorations of RV-microbiota interactions in gnotobiotic pig models, and highlight various in vivo and in vitro models that could be used in future studies to better define how the microbiota may regulate RV infection and host antiviral immune responses.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Research findings to date related to HRV vaccine cohorts, studies of natural infection, explorations of RV-microbiota interactions in gnotobiotic pig models, and various in vivo and in vitro models that could be used in future studies to better define how the microbiota may regulate RV infection and host antiviral immune responses are detailed."}},"tag":"OTHER"},{"id":110,"details":{"paperId":"d17f1a951ce0bcea1b9add1fc4411ff6ea90f783","externalIds":{"MAG":"2015631630","DOI":"10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.08.028","CorpusId":"205617588","PubMed":"19781872"},"title":"Zoonotic aspects of rotaviruses.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Genetic heterogeneity in the 11 double stranded RNA segments across different rotavirus strains has provided evidence for frequent intersections between the evolution of human and animal rotaviruses, as a result of multiple, repeated events of interspecies transmission and subsequent adaptation."}},"tag":"OTHER"}]
