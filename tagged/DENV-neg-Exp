Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes N-7 and 2′-O methyltransferase activities that are required for the formation of 5′ type I cap (m7GpppAm) of viral RNA genome. Here we reported, for the first time, that flavivirus NS5 has a novel internal RNA methylation activity. Recombinant NS5 proteins of West Nile virus and Dengue virus (serotype 4; DENV-4) specifically methylates polyA, but not polyG, polyC, or polyU, indicating that the methylation occurs at adenosine residue. RNAs with internal adenosines substituted with 2′-O-methyladenosines are not active substrates for internal methylation, whereas RNAs with adenosines substituted with N6-methyladenosines can be efficiently methylated, suggesting that the internal methylation occurs at the 2′-OH position of adenosine. Mass spectroscopic analysis further demonstrated that the internal methylation product is 2′-O-methyladenosine. Importantly, genomic RNA purified from DENV virion contains 2′-O-methyladenosine. The 2′-O methylation of internal adenosine does not require specific RNA sequence since recombinant methyltransferase of DENV-4 can efficiently methylate RNAs spanning different regions of viral genome, host ribosomal RNAs, and polyA. Structure-based mutagenesis results indicate that K61-D146-K181-E217 tetrad of DENV-4 methyltransferase forms the active site of internal methylation activity; in addition, distinct residues within the methyl donor (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) pocket, GTP pocket, and RNA-binding site are critical for the internal methylation activity. Functional analysis using flavivirus replicon and genome-length RNAs showed that internal methylation attenuated viral RNA translation and replication.

Approved vaccines are not available, and targets suitable for the development of antiviral drugs are lacking. One possible drug target is nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B), because it is absolutely required for virus replication; however, its exact role in the DENV replication cycle is largely unknown. With the aim of mapping NS4B determinants critical for DENV replication, we performed a reverse genetic screening of 33 NS4B mutants in the context of an infectious DENV genome. While the majority of these mutations were lethal, for several of them, we were able to select for second-site pseudoreversions, most often residing in NS4B and restoring replication competence. To identify all viral NS4B interaction partners, we engineered a fully viable DENV genome encoding an affinity-tagged NS4B. Mass spectrometry-based analysis of the NS4B complex isolated from infected cells identified the NS3 protease/helicase as a major interaction partner of NS4B. By combining the genetic complementation map of NS4B with a replication-independent expression system, we identified the NS4B cytosolic loop—more precisely, amino acid residue Q134—as a critical determinant for NS4B-NS3 interaction. An alanine substitution at this site completely abrogated the interaction and DENV RNA replication, and both were restored by pseudoreversions A69S and A137V. This strict correlation between the degree of NS4B-NS3 interaction and DENV replication provides strong evidence that this viral protein complex plays a pivotal role during the DENV replication cycle, hence representing a promising target for novel antiviral strategies. IMPORTANCE With no approved therapy or vaccine against dengue virus infection, the viral nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) represents a possible drug target, because it is indispensable for virus replication. However, little is known about its precise structure and function. Here, we established the first comprehensive genetic interaction map of NS4B, identifying amino acid residues that are essential for virus replication, as well as second-site mutations compensating for their defects. Additionally, we determined the NS4B viral interactome in infected cells and identified the NS3 protease/helicase as a major interaction partner of NS4B. We mapped residues in the cytosolic loop of NS4B as critical determinants for interaction with NS3, as well as RNA replication.

It is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viruses, infecting globally 390 million individuals per year. The clinical spectrum of DV infection ranges from an asymptomatic course to severe complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the latter because of severe plasma leakage. Given that the outcome of infection is likely determined by the kinetics of viral replication and the antiviral host cell immune response (HIR) it is of importance to understand the interaction between these two parameters. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to characterize and understand the complex interplay between intracellular DV replication and the host cells' defense mechanisms. We first measured viral RNA, viral protein, and virus particle production in Huh7 cells, which exhibit a notoriously weak intrinsic antiviral response. Based on these measurements, we developed a detailed intracellular DV replication model. We then measured replication in IFN competent A549 cells and used this data to couple the replication model with a model describing IFN activation and production of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), as well as their interplay with DV replication. By comparing the cell line specific DV replication, we found that host factors involved in replication complex formation and virus particle production are crucial for replication efficiency. Regarding possible modes of action of the HIR, our model fits suggest that the HIR mainly affects DV RNA translation initiation, cytosolic DV RNA degradation, and naïve cell infection.

Blood vessels of the microvasculature are composed of a tubular structure of endothelial cells ensheathed by perivascular cells (pericytes). Pericytes support endothelial cell barrier formation and maintenance through paracrine and contact-mediated signalling, and are critical to microvascular integrity. Pericyte dysfunction has been linked to vascular leakage in noncommunicable pathologies such as diabetic retinopathy, but has never been linked to infection-related vascular leakage. Dengue vascular leakage has been shown to result in part from the direct action of the secreted dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein NS1 on endothelial cells. Using primary human vascular cells, we show here that NS1 also causes pericyte dysfunction, and that NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability is more pronounced in the presence of pericytes. Notably, NS1 specifically disrupted the ability of pericytes to support endothelial cell function in a 3D microvascular assay, with no effect on pericyte viability or physiology. These effects are mediated at least in part through contact-independent paracrine signals involved in endothelial barrier maintenance by pericytes. We therefore identify a role for pericytes in amplifying NS1-induced microvascular hyperpermeability in severe dengue, and thus show that pericytes can play a critical role in the aetiology of an infectious vascular leakage syndrome. These findings open new avenues of research for the development of drugs and diagnostic assays for combating infection-induced vascular leakage, such as severe dengue. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The World Health Organisation considers dengue one of the top ten global public health problems. There is no specific antiviral therapy to treat dengue virus and no way of predicting which patients will develop potentially fatal severe dengue, typified by vascular leakage and circulatory shock. We show here that perivascular cells (pericytes) amplify the vascular leakage-inducing effects of the dengue viral protein NS1 through contact-independent signalling to endothelial cells.

As the largest protein component within the flavivirus RC, NS5 plays key enzymatic roles through its N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) and C-terminal RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains, and constitutes a major target for antivirals. We determined a crystal structure of the full-length NS5 protein from Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) at a resolution of 2.3 Å in the presence of bound SAH and GTP. Although the overall molecular shape of NS5 from DENV3 resembles that of NS5 from Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), the relative orientation between the MTase and RdRp domains differs between the two structures, providing direct evidence for the existence of a set of discrete stable molecular conformations that may be required for its function. While the inter-domain region is mostly disordered in NS5 from JEV, the NS5 structure from DENV3 reveals a well-ordered linker region comprising a short 310 helix that may act as a swivel. Solution Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis reveals an increased mobility of the thumb subdomain of RdRp in the context of the full length NS5 protein which correlates well with the analysis of the crystallographic temperature factors.

This results in exposure of the ∼15 residue fusion peptide (FP) region, freeing it to induce fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes. A better understanding of the conformational dynamics of the FP in the presence of membranes, and the basis for its selectivity for anionic lipid species present within the endosome, would facilitate its therapeutic targeting with antiviral drugs and antibodies. In this work, multiscale modeling, simulations, and free energy calculations (including a total of ∼75 μs of atomic-resolution sampling), combined with imaging total internal reflection fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments, were employed to investigate the mechanisms of interaction of FP variants with lipid bilayers. Wild-type FPs (in the presence or absence of a fluorescein isothiocyanate tag) were shown to possess a funneled conformational landscape governing their exit from solvent and penetration into the lipid phase and to exhibit an electrostatically favored >2-fold affinity for membranes containing anionic species over purely zwitterionic ones.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for dengue disease, a major human health concern for which no specific therapies are available. Like other viruses, DENV relies heavily on the host cellular machinery for productive infection. In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen using haploid HAP1 cells to identify host genes important for DENV infection. We identified DPM1 and -3, two subunits of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS) complex, as host dependency factors for DENV and other related flaviviruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV). The DPMS complex catalyzes the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM), which serves as mannosyl donor in pathways leading to N-glycosylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, and C- or O-mannosylation of proteins in the ER lumen. Mutation in the DXD motif of DPM1, which is essential for its catalytic activity, abolished DPMS-mediated DENV infection. Similarly, genetic ablation of ALG3, a mannosyltransferase that transfers mannose to lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), rendered cells poorly susceptible to DENV. We also established that in cells deficient for DPMS activity, viral RNA amplification is hampered and truncated oligosaccharides are transferred to the viral prM and E glycoproteins, affecting their proper folding. Overall, our study provides new insights into the host-dependent mechanisms of DENV infection and supports current therapeutic approaches using glycosylation inhibitors to treat DENV infection.

The recent reemergence and spread of flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), highlight the importance of performing basic research on this important group of pathogens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that modulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and have been demonstrated to regulate a broad range of cellular processes. Our research is focused on identifying pro- and antiflaviviral miRNAs as a means of characterizing cellular pathways that support or limit viral replication. We have screened a library of known human miRNA mimics for their effect on the replication of three flaviviruses, DENV, WNV, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), using a high-content immunofluorescence screen. Several families of miRNAs were identified as inhibiting multiple flaviviruses, including the miRNA miR-34, miR-15, and miR-517 families. Members of the miR-34 family, which have been extensively characterized for their ability to repress Wnt/β-catenin signaling, demonstrated strong antiflaviviral effects, and this inhibitory activity extended to other viruses, including ZIKV, alphaviruses, and herpesviruses. Previous research suggested a possible link between the Wnt and type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. Therefore, we investigated the role of type I IFN induction in the antiviral effects of the miR-34 family and confirmed that these miRNAs potentiate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus, the induction of IFN-responsive genes, and the release of type I IFN from transfected cells. We further demonstrate that the intersection between the Wnt and IFN signaling pathways occurs at the point of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)–TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) binding, inducing TBK1 to phosphorylate IRF3 and initiate downstream IFN signaling. In this way, we have identified a novel cellular signaling network with a critical role in regulating the replication of multiple virus families. These findings highlight the opportunities for using miRNAs as tools to discover and characterize unique cellular factors involved in supporting or limiting virus replication, opening up new avenues for antiviral research. IMPORTANCE MicroRNAs are a class of small regulatory RNAs that modulate cellular processes through the posttranscriptional repression of multiple transcripts. We hypothesized that individual miRNAs may be capable of inhibiting viral replication through their effects on host proteins or pathways. To test this, we performed a high-content screen for miRNAs that inhibit the replication of three medically relevant members of the flavivirus family: West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus 2. The results of this screen identify multiple miRNAs that inhibit one or more of these viruses. Extensive follow-up on members of the miR-34 family of miRNAs, which are active against all three viruses as well as the closely related Zika virus, demonstrated that miR-34 functions through increasing the infected cell's ability to respond to infection through the interferon-based innate immune pathway. Our results not only add to the knowledge of how viruses interact with cellular pathways but also provide a basis for more extensive data mining by providing a comprehensive list of miRNAs capable of inhibiting flavivirus replication. Finally, the miRNAs themselves or cellular pathways identified as modulating virus infection may prove to be novel candidates for the development of therapeutic interventions.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work investigated the role of type I IFN induction in the antiviral effects of the miR-34 family and confirmed that these miRNAs potentiate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus, the induction of IFN-responsive genes, and the release of typeI IFN from transfected cells."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6132,"details":{"paperId":"bc4e8cde3b58cc0bd65a1936e3252b0899a0b28b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2021305380","PubMedCentral":"3362616","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0001663","CorpusId":"18267481","PubMed":"22666512"},"title":"A Model of DENV-3 Infection That Recapitulates Severe Disease and Highlights the Importance of IFN-γ in Host Resistance to Infection","abstract":"There are few animal models of dengue infection, especially in immunocompetent mice.

IFN-γ expression increased after DENV-3 infection of WT mice and this was preceded by increase in expression of IL-12 and IL-18. In DENV-3-inoculated IFN-γ−/− mice, there was enhanced lethality, which was preceded by severe disease manifestation and virus replication.

Mosquito-borne flaviviruses can persistently infect the mosquito central nervous system without causing dramatic pathology or influencing the mosquito behavior and lifespan. The mechanism by which the mosquito nervous system resists flaviviral infection is still largely unknown. Here we report that an Aedes aegypti homologue of the neural factor Hikaru genki (AaHig) efficiently restricts flavivirus infection of the central nervous system. AaHig was predominantly expressed in the mosquito nervous system and localized to the plasma membrane of neural cells. Functional blockade of AaHig enhanced Dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but not Sindbis virus (SINV), replication in mosquito heads and consequently caused neural apoptosis and a dramatic reduction in the mosquito lifespan. Consistently, delivery of recombinant AaHig to mosquitoes reduced viral infection. Furthermore, the membrane-localized AaHig directly interfaced with a highly conserved motif in the surface envelope proteins of DENV and JEV, and consequently interrupted endocytic viral entry into mosquito cells. Loss of either plasma membrane targeting or virion-binding ability rendered AaHig nonfunctional. Interestingly, Culex pipien pallens Hig also demonstrated a prominent anti-flavivirus activity, suggesting a functionally conserved function for Hig.

ABSTRACT Viruses have developed innovative strategies to exploit the cellular machinery and overcome the antiviral defenses of the host, often using specifically structured RNA elements. Examples are found in the Flavivirus genus (in the family Flaviviridae), where during flaviviral infection, pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) accumulate in the cell. These sfRNAs are formed when a host cell 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease degrades the viral genomic RNA but is blocked by an exoribonuclease-resistant RNA structure (xrRNA) located in the viral genome’s 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Although known to exist in several Flaviviridae genera, the full distribution and diversity of xrRNAs in this family were unknown. Using the recently solved high-resolution structure of an xrRNA from the divergent flavivirus Tamana bat virus (TABV) as a reference, we used bioinformatic searches to identify xrRNAs in the remaining three genera of Flaviviridae: Pegivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus. We biochemically and structurally characterized several examples, determining that they are genuine xrRNAs with a conserved fold. These new xrRNAs look superficially similar to the previously described xrRNAs but possess structural differences making them distinct from previous classes of xrRNAs. Overall, we have identified the presence of xrRNA in all four genera of Flaviviridae, but not in all species. Our findings thus require adjustments of previous xrRNA classification schemes and expand the previously known distribution of xrRNA in Flaviviridae.

The type I interferon (IFN) system has evolved in vertebrates to generate tissue responses that actively block replication of multiple known and potentially zoonotic viruses. As such, its control and activation through pharmacological agents may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for simultaneously impairing growth of multiple virus types and rendering host populations resistant to virus spread. In light of this strategy’s potential, we undertook a screen to identify novel interferon-activating small molecules. Here, we describe 1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-(5-isopropyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-1,2-dihydrochromeno[2,3-c]pyrrole-3,9-dione, which we termed AV-C. Treatment of human cells with AV-C activates innate and interferon-associated responses that strongly inhibit replication of Zika, Chikungunya, and dengue viruses. By utilizing genome editing, we investigated the host proteins essential to AV-C-induced cellular states. This showed that the compound requires a TRIF-dependent signaling cascade that culminates in IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent expression and secretion of type I interferon to elicit antiviral responses. The other canonical IRF3-terminal adaptor proteins STING and IPS-1/MAVS were dispensable for AV-C-induced phenotypes. However, our work revealed an important inhibitory role for IPS-1/MAVS, but not TRIF, in flavivirus replication, implying that TRIF-directed viral evasion may not occur. Additionally, we show that in response to AV-C, primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines that are linked with establishment of adaptive immunity to viral pathogens. Ultimately, synthetic innate immune activators such as AV-C may serve multiple therapeutic purposes, including direct antimicrobial responses and facilitation of pathogen-directed adaptive immunity. IMPORTANCE The type I interferon system is part of the innate immune response that has evolved in vertebrates as a first line of broad-spectrum immunological defense against an unknowable diversity of microbial, especially viral, pathogens. Here, we characterize a novel small molecule that artificially activates this response and in so doing generates a cellular state antagonistic to growth of currently emerging viruses: Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue virus. We also show that this molecule is capable of eliciting cellular responses that are predictive of establishment of adaptive immunity. As such, this agent may represent a powerful and multipronged therapeutic tool to combat emerging and other viral diseases.

Innate immune activation by Nod-like receptors (NLRs) is a critical part of host defense against viral infection. Here, we revealed a key mechanism of NLRP12-mediated regulation in DENV infection. Firstly, NLRP12 expression was inhibited in human macrophage following DENV or other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) infection. Positive regulatory domain 1 (PRDM1) was induced by DENV or poly(I:C) and suppressed NLRP12 expression, which was dependent on TBK-1/IRF3 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Moreover, NLRP12 inhibited DENV and other flaviviruses (JEV, YFV, ZIKV) replication, which relied on the well-conserved nucleotide binding structures of its NACHT domain. Furthermore, NLRP12 could interact with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) dependent on its Walker A and Walker B sites.

However, few interactions between DENV and human proteins have been reported to date. To identify DENV-human protein interactions, we used high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assays to screen the 10 DENV proteins against a human liver activation domain library. From 45 DNA-binding domain clones containing either full-length viral genes or partially overlapping gene fragments, we identified 139 interactions between DENV and human proteins, the vast majority of which are novel. These interactions involved 105 human proteins, including six previously implicated in DENV infection and 45 linked to the replication of other viruses. Human proteins with functions related to the complement and coagulation cascade, the centrosome, and the cytoskeleton were enriched among the DENV interaction partners. To determine if the cellular proteins were required for DENV infection, we used small interfering RNAs to inhibit their expression. Six of 12 proteins targeted (CALR, DDX3X, ERC1, GOLGA2, TRIP11, and UBE2I) caused a significant decrease in the replication of a DENV replicon. We further showed that calreticulin colocalized with viral dsRNA and with the viral NS3 and NS5 proteins in DENV-infected cells, consistent with a direct role for calreticulin in DENV replication. Human proteins that interacted with DENV had significantly higher average degree and betweenness than expected by chance, which provides additional support for the hypothesis that viruses preferentially target cellular proteins that occupy central position in the human protein interaction network.

Viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is a key component of the viral replication machinery that performs multiple functions during viral replication and participates in antiviral evasion. Using dengue virus infectious clones and reporter systems to dissect each step of the viral life cycle, we examined the requirements of different domains of NS3 on viral particle assembly. A thorough site-directed mutagenesis study based on solvent-accessible surface areas of NS3 revealed that, in addition to being essential for RNA replication, different domains of dengue virus NS3 are critically required for production of infectious viral particles. Unexpectedly, point mutations in the protease, interdomain linker, or helicase domain were sufficient to abolish infectious particle formation without affecting translation, polyprotein processing, or RNA replication. In particular, we identified a novel proline-rich N-terminal unstructured region of NS3 that contains several amino acid residues involved in infectious particle formation. We also showed a new role for the interdomain linker of NS3 in virion assembly. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive genetic map of novel NS3 determinants for viral particle assembly. Importantly, our results provide evidence of a central role of NS3 in the coordination of both dengue virus RNA replication and particle formation.

ABSTRACT While the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood, little is known about the postfusion events that precede RNA replication, such as nucleocapsid disassembly. We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFVΔSK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFVΔSK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways and cellular factors, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E and RPLP1 expression. The initial round of YFV translation was shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur. Importantly, translation of incoming YFV genomes also required valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large complexes.

The lack of an appropriate animal model of DEN has greatly impeded the study of its pathogenesis and the development of vaccines/antivirals. We recently reported a DEN virus 2 (DENV-2) strain (D2Y98P) that lethally infects immunocompromised AG129 mice, resulting in organ damage or dysfunction and increased vascular permeability, hallmarks of severe DEN in patients (G.

By mutagenesis, we showed that a Phe-to-Leu alteration at amino acid position 52 in nonstructural protein NS4B completely abolished the pathogenicity of the D2Y98P virus, as evidenced by a lack of lethality and the absence of histological signs of disease, which correlated with reduced viral titers and intact vascular permeability. Conversely, a Leu-to-Phe alteration at position 52 of NS4B in nonvirulent DENV-2 strain TSV01 led to 80% lethality and increased viremia. The NS4B(Phe52) viruses displayed enhanced RNA synthesis in mammalian cells but not in mosquito cells. The increased viral RNA synthesis was independent of the ability of NS4B to interfere with the host type I interferon response. Overall, our results demonstrate that Phe at position 52 in NS4B confers virulence in mice on two independent DENV-2 strains through enhancement of viral RNA synthesis.

The investigators reverse engineered this mutation into the NS1 protein of a dengue virus serotype 2 mildly infectious strain. The resulting T164S mutant dengue virus produced more secreted NS1 than wild-type virus in infected mammalian cell lines, mosquitoes, and mice. Gene expression analysis and direct measurement of factors promoting disease severity in mice revealed an association between the T164S mutation in NS1 and its lipoprotein structure.

Data from in vitro polymerase assays further demonstrate that perturbing the JEV-mode but not the DENV3-mode intra-molecular interactions inhibits catalysis only at initiation, while the cell-based virological analysis suggests that both modes of interactions are important for virus proliferation. Our work highlights the role of MTase as a unique intra-molecular initiation factor specifically only through the JEV-mode conformation, providing an example of conformation-based crosstalk between naturally fused protein functional modules.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Two forms of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) NS5 crystal structures representing two conformational states with defined analogies to the JEV-mode and DENV3-mode conformations are reported, demonstrating the conservation of both conformation modes and providing clues for how different conformationalStates may be interconnected."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5748,"details":{"paperId":"9ce1056ace4a0b181ca34fd53b7fa42081ee1f05","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"2657137","MAG":"1987560159","DOI":"10.1186/1743-422X-6-14","CorpusId":"3629602","PubMed":"19196463"},"title":"A conserved predicted pseudoknot in the NS2A-encoding sequence of West Nile and Japanese encephalitis flaviviruses suggests NS1' may derive from ribosomal frameshifting","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is hypothesized that the functional importance of the pseudoknot is to stimulate a portion of ribosomes to shift -1 nt into a short (45 codon), conserved, overlapping open reading frame, termed foo."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4218,"details":{"paperId":"c95d4a140db5fc61e49f043ed03d85a59bd721ce","externalIds":{"MAG":"2143069589","DOI":"10.1099/vir.0.035964-0","CorpusId":"5618540","PubMed":"21957123"},"title":"A conserved region in the prM protein is a critical determinant in the assembly of flavivirus particles.","abstract":"Flaviviruses are assembled to bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are secreted through the vesicle transport pathway, but the details of the molecular mechanism of virion assembly remain largely unknown.

However, this is precluded by limitations of current cell-based systems for monitoring flavivirus infection in living cells. In the present study, we report the construction of fluorescence-activatable sensors to detect the activities of flavivirus NS2B–NS3 serine proteases in living cells. The system consists of GFP-based reporters that become fluorescent upon cleavage by recombinant DENV-2/ZIKV proteases in vitro. A version of this sensor containing the flavivirus internal NS3 cleavage site linker reported the highest fluorescence activation in stably transduced mammalian cells upon DENV-2/ZIKV infection. Moreover, the onset of fluorescence correlated with viral protease activity. A far-red version of this flavivirus sensor had the best signal-to-noise ratio in a fluorescent Dulbecco's plaque assay, leading to the construction of a multireporter platform combining the flavivirus sensor with reporter dyes for detection of chromatin condensation and cell death, enabling studies of viral plaque formation with single-cell resolution. Finally, the application of this platform enabled the study of cell-population kinetics of infection and cell death by DENV-2, ZIKV, and yellow fever virus.

In infected cells, flaviviruses first assemble into an immature form within the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), and then undergo further processing by furin protease in the trans-Golgi. Despite substantial efforts, previous cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of immature flaviviruses were restricted to low to medium resolutions, limiting our understanding of maturation. To better grasp the process of maturation, we have carried out cryo-EM reconstructions of immature Spondweni virus (SPOV), an emerging human flavivirus belonging to the same serogroup as ZIKV (~75% amino acid identity). By combining localized reconstruction and focused refinement, we were able to improve the resolution to 3.8 Å, yielding unprecedented insight into the immature form. The structure elucidates how, at neutral pH, polar interactions conceal the furin recognition site within trimeric envelope (E) protein spikes. Furthermore, we identify how a strictly conserved pH sensor anchors the precursor membrane (prM) protein to immature E. We reconstructed mature forms of SPONV and DENV to 2.6Å and 3.1Å, respectively. Comparison with immature virus shows a conserved binding pocket for a lipid headgroup, which forms as a consequence of the rearrangement of amphipathic stem-helices of E.

Examples are found in flaviviruses; during flaviviral infection, pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) accumulate in the cell. These sfRNAs are formed when a host cell 5’ to 3’ exoribonuclease degrades the viral genomic RNA but is blocked by an exoribonuclease resistant RNA structure (xrRNA) located in the viral genome’s 3’untranslated region (UTR). Although known to exist in several Flaviviridae genera the full distribution and diversity of xRNAs in this virus family was unknown. Using the recent high-resolution structure of an xrRNA from the divergent flavivirus Tamana bat virus (TABV) as a reference, we used bioinformatic searches to identify xrRNA in the Pegivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus genera. We biochemically and structurally characterized several examples, determining that they are genuine xrRNAs with a conserved fold. These new xrRNAs look superficially similar to the previously described xrRNAs but possess structural differences making them distinct from previous classes of xrRNAs. Our findings thus require adjustments of previous xrRNA classification schemes and expand on the previously known distribution of the xrRNA in Flaviviridae, indicating their widespread distribution and illustrating their importance. IMPORTANCE The Flaviviridae comprise one of the largest families of positive sense single stranded (+ssRNA) and it is divided into the Flavivirus, Pestivirus, Pegivirus, and Hepacivirus genera. The genus Flavivirus contains many medically relevant viruses such as Zika Virus, Dengue Virus, and Powassan Virus. In these, a part of the virus’s RNA twists up into a very special three-dimensional shape called an xrRNA that blocks the ability of the cell to “chew up” the viral RNA. Hence, part of the virus’ RNA remains intact, and this protected part is important for viral infection. This was known to occur in Flaviviruses but whether it existed in the other members of the family was not known. In this study, we not only identified a new subclass of xrRNA found in Flavivirus but also in the remaining three genera. The fact that this process of viral RNA maturation exists throughout the entire Flaviviridae family makes it clear that this is an important but underappreciated part of the infection strategy of these diverse human pathogens.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A new subclass of xrRNA is identified found in Flavivirus but also in the remaining three genera of the Flaviviridae, indicating their widespread distribution and illustrating their importance."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5969,"details":{"paperId":"fe5a02ff2a266a813fb1f2fc4fd04d8fdd508486","externalIds":{"MAG":"2118614072","DOI":"10.1261/rna.034330.112","CorpusId":"13076131","PubMed":"23006624"},"title":"A noncoding RNA produced by arthropod-borne flaviviruses inhibits the cellular exoribonuclease XRN1 and alters host mRNA stability.","abstract":"All arthropod-borne flaviviruses generate a short noncoding RNA (sfRNA) from the viral 3' untranslated region during infection due to stalling of the cellular 5'-to-3' exonuclease XRN1.

XRN1 repression also resulted in the increased overall stability of cellular mRNAs in flavivirus-infected cells. Importantly, a mutant Kunjin virus that cannot form sfRNA but replicates to normal levels failed to affect host mRNA stability or XRN1 activity. Expression of sfRNA in the absence of viral infection demonstrated that sfRNA formation was directly responsible for the stabilization of cellular mRNAs.

Despite the serious socio-economic impact of DENV-associated diseases, antiviral therapy is missing. DENV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells and induces a membranous replication organelle, formed by invaginations of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and designated vesicle packets (VPs). Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of DENV is a multifunctional protein. It is secreted from cells to counteract antiviral immune responses, but also critically contributes to the severe clinical manifestations of dengue. In addition, NS1 is indispensable for viral RNA replication, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we employed a combination of genetic, biochemical and imaging approaches to dissect the determinants in NS1 contributing to its various functions in the viral replication cycle. Several important observations were made. First, we identified a cluster of amino acid residues in the exposed region of the β-ladder domain of NS1 that are essential for NS1 secretion. Second, we revealed a novel interaction of NS1 with the NS4A-2K-4B cleavage intermediate, but not with mature NS4A or NS4B. This interaction is required for RNA replication, with two residues within the connector region of the NS1 “Wing” domain being crucial for binding of the NS4A-2K-4B precursor. By using a polyprotein expression system allowing the formation of VPs in the absence of viral RNA replication, we show that the NS1 –NS4A-2K-4B interaction is not required for VP formation, arguing that the association between these two proteins plays a more direct role in the RNA amplification process. Third, through analysis of polyproteins containing deletions in NS1, and employing a trans-complementation assay, we show that both cis and trans acting elements within NS1 contribute to VP formation, with the capability of NS1 mutants to form VPs correlating with their capability to support RNA replication. In conclusion, these results reveal a direct role of NS1 in VP formation that is independent from RNA replication, and argue for a critical function of a previously unrecognized NS4A-2K-NS4B precursor specifically interacting with NS1 and promoting viral RNA replication.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results reveal a direct role of NS1 in VP formation that is independent from RNA replication, and argue for a critical function of a previously unrecognized NS4A-2K-NS4B precursor specifically interacting with NS1 and promoting viral RNA replication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2163,"details":{"paperId":"8998e2c6d21721626937f8fd9eb899c08fd83836","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3985287","MAG":"1994199697","DOI":"10.1016/j.tim.2014.01.008","CorpusId":"205401172","PubMed":"24569295"},"title":"A novel membrane fusion protein family in Flaviviridae?","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is proposed that the membrane fusion machinery of the closely related pestivirus and hepatitis C virus defines a new structural class, which would shift the paradigm for how these proteins evolved."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1250,"details":{"paperId":"9514f5389ec88703698395b06e49ba3ad6704f14","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4949077","MAG":"2406133044","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.05.033","CorpusId":"205816381","PubMed":"27241849"},"title":"A novel mosquito ubiquitin targets viral envelope protein for degradation and reduces virion production during dengue virus infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The overexpression of Ub3881, but not related ubiquitin proteins, decreased DENV infection in mosquito cells and live Ae."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2479,"details":{"paperId":"871ffeeae74919caee3176b227d56c261b553cd0","externalIds":{"MAG":"2803009426","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2018.04.011","CorpusId":"13682414","PubMed":"29727815"},"title":"A novel p53 paralogue mediates antioxidant defense of mosquito cells to survive dengue virus replication.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A novel p53 paralogue (p53-2) was identified and proved to be regulated in C6/36 cells with DENV2 infection and was demonstrated to transcribe catalase which plays a critical role in reducing ROS accumulation and the death rate of infected cells."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2509,"details":{"paperId":"7725a9008aa56ce3ab7b3f35149de1e572e6e305","externalIds":{"MAG":"2029896292","DOI":"10.1016/J.VIRUSRES.2006.11.002","CorpusId":"37362358","PubMed":"17156880"},"title":"A novel tetraspanin C189 upregulated in C6/36 mosquito cells following dengue 2 virus infection.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Based on semi-quantitative and real-time RT-PCR, one novel gene, named C189, was significantly upregulated in infected C6/36 cells, suggesting that tetraspanin upregulation is not related to virus binding to the cell surface, and that C189 does not function as a receptor for dengue virus entry."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":3026,"details":{"paperId":"91a6cf9c3634f7fc727bb00f5ee1bd7b6c18853f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4837045","MAG":"2307244008","DOI":"10.1038/ni.3393","CorpusId":"15196201","PubMed":"26998762"},"title":"A phosphomimetic-based mechanism of dengue virus to antagonize innate immunity","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work finds that the NS3 protein of dengue virus (DV) bound to 14-3-3ɛ and prevented translocation of RIG-I to the adaptor MAVS and thereby blocked antiviral signaling."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6050,"details":{"paperId":"f031d690fc859e822bef93f0755f1b0ea1d2a735","externalIds":{"MAG":"2901031282","PubMedCentral":"6872170","DBLP":"journals/ploscb/MapderCAB19","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006668","CorpusId":"91944749","PubMed":"31710599"},"title":"A population of bang-bang switches of defective interfering particles makes within-host dynamics of dengue virus controllable","abstract":"The titre of virus in a dengue patient and the duration of this viraemia has a profound effect on whether or not a mosquito will become infected when it feeds on the patient and this, in turn is a key driver of the magnitude of a dengue outbreak. As mosquitoes require 100-1000 times more virus to become infected than a patient, the transmission of dengue virus from a patient to a mosquito is a vulnerability that may be able to be targeted to improve disease control. The intrinsic variability in the within-host dynamics of viraemias is explored for a population of patients using the method of population of models (POMs). A dataset from 207 patients is used to calibrate 20,000 models for the infection kinetics for each of the four dengue virus serotypes.

These defective viruses can only replicate with the assistance of fully functional viruses and they reduce the yield of the fully functional viruses. They are known as defective interfering (DI) particles. By administering additional, defined, DI particles to patients it may be possible to reduce the titre and duration of their viraemia. This, in turn may reduce the severity of the disease and the likelihood that dengue virus will be passed from the patient to a mosquito vector.

Although recombination between flavivirus genomes has never been demonstrated experimentally, the potential risk of generating undesirable recombinants has nevertheless been a matter of concern and controversy with respect to the development of live flavivirus vaccines. As an experimental system for investigating the ability of flavivirus genomes to recombine, we developed a “recombination trap,” which was designed to allow the products of rare recombination events to be selected and amplified. To do this, we established reciprocal packaging systems consisting of pairs of self-replicating subgenomic RNAs (replicons) derived from tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) that could complement each other in trans and thus be propagated together in cell culture over multiple passages. Any infectious viruses with intact, full-length genomes that were generated by recombination of the two replicons would be selected and enriched by end point dilution passage, as was demonstrated in a spiking experiment in which a small amount of wild-type virus was mixed with the packaged replicons. Using the recombination trap and the JEV system, we detected two aberrant recombination events, both of which yielded unnatural genomes containing duplications. Infectious clones of both of these genomes yielded viruses with impaired growth properties. Despite the fact that the replicon pairs shared approximately 600 nucleotides of identical sequence where a precise homologous crossover event would have yielded a wild-type genome, this was not observed in any of these systems, and the TBEV and WNV systems did not yield any viable recombinant genomes at all.

We exposed specimens to either a dengue or naïve blood meal, and then characterized the response in ten gene co-expression modules based on their transcriptional associations with environmental stress and time. We further analyzed the top 30 hub or master regulatory genes in each of the modules, and validated our results via qRT-PCR.

To reach the fetal brain, a virus must be transported from the maternal to the fetal circulation, which requires crossing of the placental barrier. Our studies demonstrate that mammalian cell-derived ZIKV, but not two other globally relevant flaviviruses, efficiently infects fetal endothelial cells, a key component of the placental barrier, because only ZIKV can efficiently use the cell-surface receptor AXL. These data suggest that use of AXL allows ZIKV to enter the fetal bloodstream to gain access to other fetal tissues. Thus, this study provides insight into the unique properties of ZIKV that contribute to its ability to cause microcephaly and other congenital infections and diseases. Although a causal relationship between Zika virus (ZIKV) and microcephaly has been established, it remains unclear why ZIKV, but not other pathogenic flaviviruses, causes congenital defects. Here we show that when viruses are produced in mammalian cells, ZIKV, but not the closely related dengue virus (DENV) or West Nile virus (WNV), can efficiently infect key placental barrier cells that directly contact the fetal bloodstream. We show that AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is the primary ZIKV entry cofactor on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and that ZIKV uses AXL with much greater efficiency than does DENV or WNV. Consistent with this observation, only ZIKV, but not WNV or DENV, bound the AXL ligand Gas6. In comparison, when DENV and WNV were produced in insect cells, they also infected HUVECs in an AXL-dependent manner.

Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs blocked virus secretion, most significantly upon Lyn-deficiency. Lyn-/- cells were severely impaired in virus release, and were rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We further established that Lyn, via its palmitoylation-dependent membrane association, triggered post-Golgi virus transport in specialised Rab11 and Transferrin receptor positive organelles resembling secretory autophagosomes, and distinct from conventional exocytic vesicles. In the absence of Lyn activity or its aberrant membrane association, virions were sorted into the lysosomal pathway for degradation. This mode of export was specifically triggered by processed, and mature, but not by furin-resistant virus particles, and occurred with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway.

We have shown in the present study that DV can productively infect primary human MO/Mφ regardless of the stage of cell differentiation.

Secretion of these mediators was highlighted by distinct magnitude, onset, kinetics, duration, and induction potential. A chemokine-to-cytokine hierarchy was noted in the magnitude and induction potential of secretion, and a chemokine-to-cytokine-to-chemokine/Th1 cytokine cascade could be seen in the production kinetics. Furthermore, we found that terminally differentiated MO/Mφ cultured for more than 45 days could support productive DV infection and produce innate cytokines and chemokines, indicating that these mature cells were functionally competent in the context of a viral infection. In addition, DV replication in primary differentiated human MO/Mφ was enhanced and prolonged in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and LPS-mediated synergistic production of IFN-α could be seen in DV-infected MO/Mφ. The secretion of innate cytokines and chemokines by differentiated MO/Mφ suggests that regional accumulation of these mediators may occur in various tissues to which DV has disseminated and may thus result in local inflammation.

However, important questions are whether more abundant non-hematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts become infected, and whether they play any role in antiviral innate immunity in the very early stages of infection, or even if they might be used by DENV as primary replication cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Fibroblasts freshly released from healthy skin and infected 12 hours after their isolation show a positive signal for DENV. In addition, when primary skin fibroblast cultures were established and subsequently infected, we showed DENV-2 antigen-positive intracellular signal at 24 hours and 48 hours post-infection. Moreover, the fibroblasts showed productive infection in a conventional plaque assay. The skin fibroblasts infected with DENV-2 underwent potent signaling through both TLR3 and RIG- 1, but not Mda5, triggering up-regulation of IFNβ, TNFα, defensin 5 (HB5) and β defensin 2 (HβD2).

AP-1A was not involved in DENV entry into cells. However, it facilitated DENV RNA replication. Viral RNA level was reduced significantly in Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A small interfering RNA (siRNA) compared with control siRNA. Transfection of naked DENV viral RNA into Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A siRNA resulted in less viral RNA and virion production than transfection into Huh7 cells transfected with control siRNA. Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A siRNA showed greater modification of membrane structures and fewer vesicular packets compared with cells transfected with control siRNA.

Habitat expansion of Aedes, mainly due to climate change and increasing overlap between urban and wild habitats, places nearly half of the world’s population at risk for DENV infection. After a bloodmeal from a DENV-infected host, the virus enters the mosquito midgut. Next, the virus migrates to, and replicates in, other tissues, like salivary glands. Successful viral transmission occurs when the infected mosquito takes another blood meal on a susceptible host and DENV is released from the salivary gland via saliva into the skin. During viral dissemination in the mosquito and transmission to a new mammalian host, DENV interacts with a variety of vector proteins, which are uniquely important during each phase of the viral cycle. Our study focuses on the interaction between DENV particles and protein components in the A. aegypti vector. We performed a mass spectrometry assay where we identified a set of A aegypti salivary gland proteins which potentially interact with the DENV virion. Using dsRNA to silence gene expression, we analyzed the role of these proteins in viral infectivity. Two of these candidates, a synaptosomal-associated protein (AeSNAP) and a calcium transporter ATPase (ATPase) appear to play a role in viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that AeSNAP plays a protective role during DENV infection of mosquitoes and that ATPase protein is required for DENV during amplification within the vector. Importance Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the major vector of different flaviviruses that cause human diseases, including dengue virus. There is a great need for better therapeutics and preventive vaccines against flaviviruses. Flaviviruses create complex virus-host and virus-vector interactions.

Similar to many furin substrates, prM in vector-borne flaviviruses contains basic residues at positions P1, P2, and P4 proximal to the cleavage site; in addition, a number of charged residues are found at position P3 and between positions P5 and P13 that are conserved for each flavivirus antigenic complex. The influence of additional charged residues on pr-M cleavage and virus replication was investigated by replacing the 13-amino-acid, cleavage-proximal region of a dengue virus (strain 16681) with those of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and by comparing the resultant chimeric viruses generated from RNA-transfected mosquito cells. Among the three chimeric viruses, cleavage of prM was enhanced to a larger extent in JEVpr/16681 than in YFVpr/16681 but was slightly reduced in TBEVpr/16681. Unexpectedly, JEVpr/16681 exhibited decreased focus size, reduced peak titer, and depressed replication in C6/36, PS, and Vero cell lines. The reduction of JEVpr/16681 multiplication correlated with delayed export of infectious virions out of infected cells but not with changes in specific infectivity.

Thus, diverse pr-M junction-proximal sequences of flaviviruses differentially influence pr-M cleavage when tested in a dengue virus prM background. More importantly, greatly enhanced prM cleavability adversely affects dengue virus export while exerting a minimal effect on infectivity. Because extensive changes of charged residues at the pr-M junction, as in JEVpr/16681, were not observed among a large number of dengue virus isolates, these results provide a possible mechanism by which the sequence conservation of the pr-M junction of dengue virus is maintained in nature.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Diverse pr-M junction-proximal sequences of flaviviruses differentially influencePrM cleavage when tested in a dengue virus prM background and greatly enhanced prM cleavability adversely affects d Dengue virus export while exerting a minimal effect on infectivity."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7892,"details":{"paperId":"632d22a22e9fbb0663cb08a22d7f15186b5617e6","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8537470","DOI":"10.3390/v13102042","CorpusId":"239616904","PubMed":"34696472"},"title":"Altered Moesin and Actin Cytoskeleton Protein Rearrangements Affect Transendothelial Permeability in Human Endothelial Cells upon Dengue Virus Infection and TNF-α Treatment","abstract":"It has been hypothesized that the host, viral factors, and secreted cytokines (especially TNF-α) play roles in the pathogenesis of secondary dengue infections.

Moreover, DENV infection under non-neutralizing conditions prompted upregulation of CD83 and CD86 but not HLA-DR, and triggered production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In mature flavivirus particles, the stem is composed of two or three mostly amphipathic α-helices and a conserved sequence element (CS) with an undefined role in the viral life cycle. A tryptophan is the only residue within this region which is not only conserved in all vector-borne flaviviruses, but also in the group with no known vector. We investigated the importance of this residue in different stages of the viral life cycle by a mutagenesis-based approach using tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Replacing W421 by alanine or histidine strongly reduced the release of infectious virions and their thermostability, whereas fusion-related entry functions and virus maturation were still intact. Serial passaging of the mutants led to the emergence of a same-site compensatory mutation to leucine that largely restored these properties of the wildtype.

Recombinant EIII interferes with DV infection to BHK21 and C6/36 cells by blocking dengue virion adsorption to these cells. Inhibition of EIII on BHK21 cells was broad with no serotype specificity; however, inhibition of EIII on C6/36 cells was relatively serotype specific. Soluble heparin completely blocks binding of EIII to BHK21 cells, suggesting that domain III binds mainly to cell surface heparan sulfates. This suggestion is supported by the observation that EIII binds very weakly to gro2C and sog9 mutant mammalian cell lines that lack heparan sulfate. In contrast, heparin does not block binding of EIII to mosquito cells. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide that includes amino acids (aa) 380 to 389 of EIII, IGVEPGQLKL, inhibits binding of EIII to C6/36 but not BHK21 cells. This peptide corresponds to a lateral loop region on domain III of E protein, indicating a possible role of this loop in binding to mosquito cells.

Some of these adaptive mutations (e.g., in hepatitis C virus) increase the ability of RNA replication to resist the antiviral action of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β); others (e.g., in Sindbis virus) may also lead to more efficient IFN production. Using puromycin-selectable Kunjin virus (KUN) replicon RNA, we identified two adaptive mutations in the NS2A gene (producing Ala30-to-Pro and Asn101-to-Asp mutations in the gene product; for simplicity, these will be referred to hereafter as Ala30-to-Pro and Asn101-to-Asp mutations) that, when introduced individually or together into the original wild-type (wt) replicon RNA, resulted in ∼15- to 50-fold more efficient establishment of persistent replication in hamster (BHK21) and human (HEK293 and HEp-2) cell lines. Transfection with a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene under the control of the IFN-β promoter resulted in ∼6- to 7-fold-higher luciferase expression in HEp-2 cells stably expressing KUN replicon RNA with an Ala30-to-Pro mutation in the NS2A gene compared to that observed in HEp-2 cells stably expressing KUN replicon RNA with the wt NS2A gene. Moreover, cotransfection of plasmids expressing individual wt or Ala30-to-Pro-mutated NS2A genes with the IFN-β promoter reporter plasmid, followed by infection with Semliki Forest virus to activate IFN-β promoter-driven transcription, showed ∼7-fold inhibition of luciferase expression by the wt but not by the Ala30-to-Pro-mutated NS2A protein. The results show for the first time a role for the flavivirus nonstructural protein NS2A in inhibition of IFN-β promoter-driven transcription and identify a single-amino-acid mutation in NS2A that dramatically reduces this inhibitory activity. The findings determine a new function for NS2A in virus-host interactions, extend the range of KUN replicon vectors for noncytopathic gene expression, and identify NS2A as a new target for attenuation in the development of live flavivirus vaccines.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results show for the first time a role for the flavivirus nonstructural protein NS2A in inhibition of IFN-β promoter-driven transcription and identify a single-amino-acid mutation inNS2A that dramatically reduces this inhibitory activity."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4102,"details":{"paperId":"0e39170f41072b64e5c932f6880ab73bf9321fe3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2163143680","DOI":"10.1099/0022-1317-75-7-1569","CorpusId":"16768237","PubMed":"8021588"},"title":"Analysis of C-terminally truncated dengue 2 and dengue 3 virus envelope glycoproteins: processing in insect cells and immunogenic properties in mice.","abstract":"We constructed two recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis baculoviruses.

Dengue virus and other related flaviviruses have evolved RNA capping enzymes to form the viral RNA cap structure that protects the viral genome and directs efficient viral polyprotein translation. The N-terminal domain of NS5 possesses the methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities necessary for forming mature RNA cap structures. The mechanism for flavivirus guanylyltransferase activity is currently unknown, and how the capping enzyme binds its diphosphorylated RNA substrate is important for deciphering how the flavivirus guanylyltransferase functions. In this report we examine how flavivirus NS5 N-terminal capping enzymes bind to the 5′ end of the viral RNA using a fluorescence polarization-based RNA binding assay. We observed that the KD for RNA binding is approximately 200 nM Dengue, Yellow Fever, and West Nile virus capping enzymes. Removal of one or both of the 5′ phosphates reduces binding affinity, indicating that the terminal phosphates contribute significantly to binding. RNA binding affinity is negatively affected by the presence of GTP or ATP and positively affected by S-adensyl methoninine (SAM). Structural superpositioning of the dengue virus capping enzyme with the Vaccinia virus VP39 protein bound to RNA suggests how the flavivirus capping enzyme may bind RNA, and mutagenesis analysis of residues in the putative RNA binding site demonstrate that several basic residues are critical for RNA binding.

Results The overall extent of codon usage bias in 65 Flaviviridae viruses is low with the average value of GC contents being 50.5% and the highest value being 55.9%; the lowest value is 40.2%. ENC values of Flaviviridae virus genes vary from 48.75 to 57.83 with a mean value of 55.56. U- and A-ended codons are preferred in the Flaviviridae virus. Correlation analysis shows that the positive correlation between ENC value and GC content at the third nucleotide positions was significant in this family virus. The result of analysis of ENC, neutrality plot analysis, and correlation analysis revealed that codon usage bias of all the viruses was affected mainly by natural selection.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is among the most important human arboviruses and is clinically and experimentally associated with lipid metabolism disorders. Using high-resolution respirometry, we analyzed the metabolic switches induced by DENV in a human hepatic cell line. This experimental approach allowed us to determine the contribution of fatty acids, glutamine, glucose, and pyruvate to mitochondrial bioenergetics, shedding light on the mechanisms involved in DENV-induced metabolic alterations. We found that while infection strongly inhibits glutamine oxidation, it increases the cellular capacity of metabolizing glucose; remarkably, though, this substrate, instead being used as an energy source, performs an anaplerotic role in the oxidation of endogenous lipids. Fatty acids become the main energetic substrate in infected cell, and through the pharmacological modulation of β-oxidation we demonstrated that this pathway is essential for virus replication. Interestingly, infected cells were much less susceptible to the Crabtree effect, i.e., the glucose-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, suggesting that infection favors cellular respiration by increasing ADP availability.

Flavivirus NS1 is a secreted nonstructural glycoprotein that accumulates in blood, is displayed on the surface of infected cells, and has been hypothesized to have immune evasion functions. Herein, we demonstrate that dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) NS1 attenuate classical and lectin pathway activation by directly interacting with C4. Binding of NS1 to C4 reduced C4b deposition and C3 convertase (C4b2a) activity. Although NS1 bound C4b, it lacked intrinsic cofactor activity to degrade C4b, and did not block C3 convertase formation or accelerate decay of the C3 and C5 convertases.

The hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia include decreased production and increased destruction or consumption of platelets. We previously suggested a mechanism of molecular mimicry in which antibodies (Abs) directed against dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) cross-react with platelets. Furthermore, several lines of evidence show activation of endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages are related to dengue disease severity. Previous studies also suggested that Ab-opsonised platelets facilitate the engulfment of platelets by macrophages. Here we show that TNF-α-activated ECs upregulate adhesion molecule expression to enhance the binding of platelets and macrophages and lead to anti-DENV NS1 Ab-mediated platelet phagocytosis. We further demonstrate that the interaction between macrophages and TNF-α-activated ECs requires binding of FcγR with the Fc region of platelet-bound anti-DENV NS1 Abs. Importantly, the binding of anti-DENV NS1 Abs to platelets did not interfere with platelet adhesion to ECs. The adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and β3 integrin expressed on ECs as well as the FcγR expressed on macrophages were critical in anti-DENV NS1 Ab-mediated platelet phagocytosis on activated ECs. Moreover, anti-DENV NS1 Abs dramatically enhanced platelet engulfment by macrophages in a murine model of DENV infection.

Although a DENV vaccine has already been approved, its potential side effects have hampered its use in large-scale immunizations. ABSTRACT Dengue is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is highly endemic in tropical and subtropical countries. Symptomatic patients can rapidly progress to severe conditions of hemorrhage, plasma extravasation, and hypovolemic shock, which leads to death. The blood tests of patients with severe dengue typically reveal low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is responsible for reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and regulation of the lipid composition in peripheral tissues. It is well known that dengue virus (DENV) depends on membrane cholesterol rafts to infect and to replicate in mammalian cells. Here, we describe the interaction of DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) with apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), which is the major protein component of HDL. NS1 is secreted by infected cells and can be found circulating in the serum of patients with the onset of symptoms. NS1 concentrations in plasma are related to dengue severity, which is attributed to immune evasion and an acute inflammatory response. Our data show that the DENV NS1 protein induces an increase of lipid rafts in noninfected cell membranes and enhances further DENV infection. We also show that ApoA1-mediated lipid raft depletion inhibits DENV attachment to the cell surface. In addition, ApoA1 is able to neutralize NS1-induced cell activation and to prevent NS1-mediated enhancement of DENV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ApoA1 mimetic peptide 4F is also capable of mediating lipid raft depletion to control DENV infection. Taken together, our results suggest the potential of RCT-based therapies for dengue treatment. These results should motivate studies to assess the importance of RCT in DENV infection in vivo. IMPORTANCE DENV is one of the most relevant mosquito-transmitted viruses worldwide, infecting more than 390 million people every year and leading to more than 20 thousand deaths. Although a DENV vaccine has already been approved, its potential side effects have hampered its use in large-scale immunizations. Therefore, new treatment options are urgently needed to prevent disease worsening or to improve current clinical management of severe cases. In this study, we describe a new interaction of the NS1 protein, one of the major viral components, with a key component of HDL, ApoA1. This interaction seems to alter membrane susceptibility to virus infection and modulates the mechanisms triggered by DENV to evade the immune response. We also propose the use of a mimetic peptide named 4F, which was originally developed for atherosclerosis, as a potential therapy for relieving DENV symptoms.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A new interaction of the NS1 protein, one of the major viral components, with a key component of high-density lipoprotein, the Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) seems to alter membrane susceptibility to virus infection and modulates the mechanisms triggered by DENV to evade immune response."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":3173,"details":{"paperId":"60f13ff2c0e80475df7ebdc7c43559de2f7c43b2","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-62776-4","CorpusId":"257028499"},"title":"Apoptosis characterization in mononuclear blood leukocytes of HIV patients during dengue acute disease","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Findings provide evidence of apoptosis triggering during DENV/HIV coinfection, which may contribute to knowledge of immunological response duringDENV acute infection in HIV-patients treated with ART."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":110,"details":{"paperId":"987a6e3736d47cf4e22e5d2b2f5f0409796c6e80","externalIds":{"MAG":"2082580788","DOI":"10.1002/JMV.20004","CorpusId":"39788712","PubMed":"14748067"},"title":"Apoptosis in dengue virus infected liver cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B","abstract":"While both in vivo and in vitro evidence has suggested that liver cells undergo apoptosis in response to dengue virus infection, little is known about the mechanism of induction. Given that the p53 tumour suppressor gene is a key mediator of apoptosis, we sought to define the role of this gene in response to dengue virus infection. After infection, a p53 wild type liver cell line (HepG2) showed changes consistent with apoptosis including alterations of cell morphology, cellular detachment and DNA laddering. However, p53 was neither up‐regulated, nor showed any evidence of complexing with dengue virus proteins as determined by immunoprecipitation. Infection of a p53 null liver cell line (Hep3B) also produced changes consistent with the induction of apoptosis. While the profile of the cells undergoing apoptosis in each cell line was similar as determined by flow cytometry, the absolute levels were markedly different with up to 90% of Hep3B cells undergoing apoptosis compared to only 20% of HepG2 cells at day 5 post infection. By day 7, all Hep3B infected cells were dead. In contrast, it proved possible to culture dengue virus infected HepG2 cells for 3 months. Viral progeny released from the p53 null cell line were nine‐fold higher per attached cell than from the p53 wild type cell line. These results suggest that, while induction of apoptosis in liver cells is mediated by a non‐p53 regulated pathway, p53 may play a role in restricting the level of viral progeny to below a critical level at which apoptosis is triggered.

CBLL1 has emerged as a major hit in a recent RNA interference screen designed to identify cellular factors required for the early stages of the WNV life cycle. Follow-up experiments showed that HeLa cells knocked down for CBLL1 by a small interfering RNA (siRNA) failed to internalize WNV particles and resisted infection. Furthermore, depletion of a free-ubiquitin pool by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished WNV endocytosis, suggesting that CBLL1 acts in concert with the ubiquitin proteasome system to mediate virus internalization. Here, we examined the effect of CBLL1 knockdown and proteasome inhibitors on infection by WNV and other flaviviruses. We identified new siRNAs that repress the CBLL1 protein and strongly inhibit the endocytosis of Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterial pathogen known to require CBLL1 to invade host cells. Strikingly, however, we detected efficient WNV, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus infection of human cells, despite potent downregulation of CBLL1 by RNA interference.

Like in vertebrates, virus-host protein-protein interactions are essential for viral replication and immune evasion in the mosquito vector. Here, 79 mosquito host proteins interacting with DENV non-structural proteins NS1 and NS5 were identified by label-free mass spectrometry, followed by a functional screening. We confirmed interactions with host factors previously observed in mammals, such as the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, and we identified protein-protein interactions that seem to be specific for mosquitoes. Among the interactors, the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein Loquacious (Loqs), an RNA interference (RNAi) cofactor, was found to be essential for efficient replication of DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) in mosquito cells. Loqs did not affect viral RNA stability or translation of a DENV replicon and its proviral activity was independent of its RNAi regulatory activity. Interestingly, Loqs colocalized with DENV dsRNA in viral replication organelles in infected cells and directly interacted with high affinity with DENV RNA in the 3’ untranslated region in vitro (KD = 100-200 nM). Our study provides an interactome for DENV NS1 and NS5 and identifies Loqs as a key proviral host factor in mosquitoes. We propose that DENV hijacks a factor of the RNAi mechanism for replication of its own RNA. AUTHOR SUMMARY Dengue virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus endemic to the tropics and subtropics, affecting an estimated 390 million people yearly. While the mechanisms of infection, pathogenesis and immune evasion have been extensively studied in humans, replication in Aedes mosquitoes has received much less attention, despite being a critical step in the arbovirus transmission cycle. Here, we used a proteomic approach to identify Aedes mosquito proteins recruited by dengue virus non- structural proteins NS1 and NS5.

Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes dengue fever in humans, worldwide. Using in vitro cell lines derived from Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti, the primary vectors of DENV, we report that DENV2/DENV3-infected cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, containing infectious viral RNA and proteins. A full-length DENV2 genome, detected in arthropod EVs, was infectious to naïve mosquito and mammalian cells, including human-skin keratinocytes and blood endothelial cells. Cryo-electron microscopy showed mosquito EVs with a size range from 30 to 250 nm. Treatments with RNase A, Triton X-100, and 4G2 antibody-bead binding assays showed that infectious DENV2-RNA and proteins are contained inside EVs. Viral plaque formation and dilution assays also showed securely contained infectious viral RNA and proteins in EVs are transmitted to human cells. Up-regulated HSP70 upon DENV2 infection showed no role in viral replication and transmission through EVs. In addition, qRT-PCR and immunoblotting results revealed that DENV2 up-regulates expression of a mosquito tetraspanin-domain–containing glycoprotein, designated as Tsp29Fb, in A. aegypti mosquitoes, cells, and EVs. RNAi-mediated silencing and antibody blocking of Tsp29Fb resulted in reduced DENV2 loads in both mosquito cells and EVs. Immunoprecipitation showed Tsp29Fb to directly interact with DENV2 E-protein.

Building on previous studies involving immunofluorescence (IF) and cryoimmunoelectron microscopy of Kunjin virus (KUN)-infected cells, we sought to identify the steps involved in the assembly and maturation of KUN. Thus, using antibodies directed against envelope protein E in IF analysis, we found the accumulation of E within regions coincident with the RER and endosomal compartments. Immunogold labeling of cryosections of infected cells indicated that E and minor envelope protein prM were localized to reticulum membranes continuous with KUN-induced convoluted membranes (CM) or paracrystalline arrays (PC) and that sometimes the RER contained immunogold-labeled virus particles. Both proteins were also observed to be labeled in membranes at the periphery of the induced CM or PC structures, but the latter were very seldom labeled internally. Utilizing drugs that inhibit protein and/or membrane traffic throughout the cell, we found that the secretion of KUN particles late in infection was significantly affected in the presence of brefeldin A and that the infectivity of secreted particles was severely affected in the presence of monensin and N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin. Nocodazole did not appear to affect maturation, suggesting that microtubules play no role in assembly or maturation processes.

Although the pathogenic mechanisms underlying severe DENV disease remain unclear, one of the possible contributing factors is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) which occurs when sub-neutralizing antibodies derived from a previous DENV infection enhance viral infection through interaction between virus-antibody complexes and FcR-bearing cells, such as macrophages and basophil/mast cells. Although recent reports showed that DENV induces autophagy, the relationship between antibody-enhanced DENV infection and autophagy is not clear. Methodology/Principal Findings We showed that sub-neutralizing antibodies derived from dengue patient sera enhanced DENV infection and autophagy in the KU812 pre-basophil-like cell line as well as the HMC-1 immature mast cell line. Antibody-enhanced DENV infection of KU812 cells increased the number of autophagosome vesicles, LC3 punctation, LC3-II accumulation, and p62 degradation over that seen in cells infected with DENV alone. The percentages of DENV envelope (E) protein-positive cells and LC3 puncta following antibody-enhanced DENV infection of KU812 cells were reduced by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. Antibody-enhanced DENV infection of HMC-1 cells showed co-localization of DENV E protein and dsRNA with autophagosomes, which was inhibited by 3-MA treatment. Furthermore, DENV infection and replication were reduced when KU812 cells were transfected with the autophagy-inhibiting Atg4BC74A mutant.

In this study, DTMUV entry into BHK-21 cells was found to be inhibited by noncytotoxic concentrations of the agents chloroquine, NH4Cl, and Bafilomycin A1, which blocked the acidification of the endosomes.

Exposure of DTMUV virions to pH 5.0 in the absence of host cell membranes decreased entry into cells by 65%. Furthermore, DTMUV infection was significantly decreased by chlorpromazine treatment, or by knockdown of the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) through RNA interference, which suggested that DTMUV entry depends on clathrin.

Our study highlights the importance of the host factor BPIFB3 in regulating flavivirus replication and further confirms that the RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy pathway is antiviral to both DENV and ZIKV. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), rely heavily on the availability of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes throughout their life cycle, and degradation of ER membranes restricts flavivirus replication. Accordingly, DENV and ZIKV restrict ER turnover by protease-mediated cleavage of reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), also known as FAM134B, an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation. Given that the induction of autophagy may play an important role in flavivirus replication, the antiviral role of RETREG1 suggests that specialized autophagic pathways may have differential effects on the flavivirus life cycle. We previously identified BPI fold-containing family B member 3 (BPIFB3) as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication. Here, we show that in contrast to enteroviruses, BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNA interference-mediated silencing inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles. Mechanistically, we show that depletion of BPIFB3 enhances RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy, leading to enhanced ER turnover and the suppression of viral replication. Consistent with this, the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion can be reversed by RETREG1 silencing, suggesting a specific role for BPIFB3 in regulating ER turnover. These studies define BPIFB3 as a required host factor for both DENV and ZIKV replication and further contribute to our understanding of the requirements for autophagy during flavivirus infection.

Both DENV and ZIKV rely on expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of autophagy to establish a productive viral infection. However, little is known regarding the interplay between the requirements for autophagy initiation during infection and the mechanisms used by these viruses to avoid clearance through the autophagic pathway. We recently showed that DENV and ZIKV inhibit reticulophagy (specific degradation of the ER through autophagy) by cleaving reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation. These data suggest that DENV and ZIKV require specific autophagic pathways for their replication, while other autophagic pathways are antiviral. We previously identified BPI Fold Containing Family B Member 3 (BPIFB3) as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication. Here, we show that in contrast to enteroviruses, BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNAi-mediated silencing drastically inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles. We show that BPIFB3 depletion enhances ER fragmentation, while its overexpression protects against autophagy-induced ER degradation, demonstrating that BPIFB3 serves as a specific regulator of ER turnover. We further show that the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion on flavivirus infection are reversed in RETREG1-depleted cells, and that BPIFB3 associates with RETREG1 within the ER, suggesting that BPIFB3 regulates a RETREG1-specific reticulophagy pathway. Collectively, these studies identify BPIFB3 as a regulator of the reticulophagy pathway and define the requirements for a novel host regulator of flavivirus infection. Author Summary Flaviviruses and other arthropod transmitted viruses represent a widespread global health problem with limited treatment options currently available. Thus, greater knowledge of the host factors required for replication and transmission is needed to provide a better understanding of the cellular requirements for infection. Here, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, BPIFB3 is required to facilitate flavivirus infection. Depletion of BPIFB3 in cells inhibits dengue virus and Zika virus infection prior to replication of the viral genome. Mechanistically, we show that BPIFB3 inhibits ER degradation in an autophagy-specific manner and that loss of BPIFB3 decreases the availability of ER membranes needed for flavivirus replication. We further show that BPIFB3 specifically regulates the RETREG1 pathway, but not other pathways of ER turnover.

Identifying IFN-induced cellular proteins are essential for understanding its mechanisms against DENV. Here we established stable Huh7-derived cell lines expressing the IFN-induced cell membrane protein BST2 (Huh7-BST2) or its variant bearing a V5 tag at the C-terminal (Huh7-BST5CV5). These cell lines were infected with DENV to determine proteins modulating their anti-DENV response. We found that expression of BST2 did not affect the efficiency of DENV infection and intracellular replication. Rather, it significantly reduced the virion yield of the infected cells, particularly at low MOI infection. In addition, BST2 also decreased the foci formation and the size of infectious foci in cultured Huh7 monolayers with media containing methocellulose. The addition of the V5 tag at C-terminal inhibited the GPI modification of BST2 and blocked its shift from endoplasm to cytoplastic membrane. BST2CV5 did not affect DENV infection and foci formation in Huh7 cells but reduced virion yield by 1 log at low MOI infection. Interestingly, intracellular BST2CV5 expression was reduced by high level of DENV production. Conclusion Our results imply that BST2 is a functional mediator of the IFN response against DENV infection.

Many of the flaviviruses that are pathogenic in humans are transmitted specifically through mosquito vectors. Over the past century, many mosquito-borne flavivirus infections have emerged and re-emerged, and are of global importance with hundreds of millions of infections occurring yearly. There is a need for novel, effective, and accessible vaccines and antivirals capable of inhibiting flavivirus infection and ameliorating disease. The development of therapeutics targeting viral entry has long been a goal of antiviral research, but most efforts are hindered by the lack of broad-spectrum potency or toxicities associated with on-target effects, since many host proteins necessary for viral entry are also essential for host cell biology. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses generally enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and recent studies suggest that a subset of these viruses can be internalized through a specialized form of CME that has additional dependencies distinct from canonical CME pathways, and antivirals targeting this pathway have been discovered.

The brains of CXCR3−/− mice showed higher viral loads than those of WT mice, and quantitative analysis using real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry revealed fewer T cells, CD8+ T cells in particular, in the brains of CXCR3−/− mice.

However, the absence of E protein glycosylation among numerous natural isolates of different flaviviruses suggests that the glycan, per se, is not critically important in the virus life cycle. Consistent with this notion, we show that ablation of both glycans from the DENV-2 E protein reduces but does not prevent growth of the variant in mammalian and mosquito cells. We found a pronounced and opposing effect of glycan ablation on two stages of the virus growth cycle: infectivity and release. Loss of either of the two DENV E protein glycans markedly enhanced infectivity of variants for mosquito cells at the expense of efficient virion release. The variants also displayed reduced release in mammalian cells, which was more prominent for viruses lacking the Asn 67-linked glycan than for those lacking the Asn 153-linked glycan, without a marked change in infectivity. Mutations, which compensated for the defect in virus morphogenesis associated with ablation of the Asn 67-linked glycan in mammalian cells but interestingly not in mosquito cells, were identified at the glycosylation acceptor motif and a second site in E protein domain II.

We constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing various portions of the NS region of the dengue virus type 4 polyprotein.

At the C-terminus are two α-helices (EH1 and EH2) and two transmembrane domains (ET1 and ET2). After synthesis, E protein forms a heterodimer with the precursor membrane (prM) protein, which has been shown as a chaperone for E protein and could prevent premature fusion of E protein during maturation. Recent reports of enhancement of DENV infectivity by anti-prM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest the presence of prM protein in dengue vaccine is potentially harmful. A better understanding of prM-E interaction and its effect on recognition of E and prM proteins by different antibodies would provide important information for future design of safe and effective subunit dengue vaccines. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we examined a series of C-terminal truncation constructs of DENV4 prME, E and prM. In the absence of E protein, prM protein expressed poorly. In the presence of E protein, the expression of prM protein increased in a dose-dependent manner. Radioimmunoprecipitation, sucrose gradient sedimentation and pulse-chase experiments revealed ET1 and EH2 were involved in prM-E interaction and EH2 in maintaining the stability of prM protein. Dot blot assay revealed E protein affected the recognition of prM protein by an anti-prM mAb; truncation of EH2 or EH1 affected the recognition of E protein by several anti-E mAbs, which was further verified by capture ELISA. The E protein ectodomain alone can be recognized well by all anti-E mAbs tested. Conclusions/Significance A C-terminal domain (EH2) of DENV E protein can affect the expression and stability of its chaperone prM protein.

All cells undergoing ADE secreted proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) at enhancement titers, but distinct cell-type-specific patterns were observed for other relevant proteins (alpha/beta interferon [IFN-α/β] and IL-10). Macrophages produced type I interferons (IFN-α/β) that were modulated by ADE. Mature DC mainly secreted IFN-β. Interestingly, only monocytes secreted IL-10, and only upon antibody-enhanced infection. While ADE infection rates were remarkably consistent in monocytes (10 to 15%) across donors, IL-10 protein levels varied according to previously described regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-10 promoter region. The homozygous GCC haplotype was associated with high-level IL-10 secretion, while the ACC and ATA haplotypes produced intermediate and low levels of IL-10, respectively. Our data suggest that ADE effects are cell type specific, are influenced by host genetics, and, depending on relative infection rates, may further contribute to the complexity of DV pathogenesis.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data suggest that ADE effects are cell type specific, influenced by host genetics, and, depending on relative infection rates, may further contribute to the complexity of DV pathogenesis."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6794,"details":{"paperId":"9c47e7f7492273d476f611b28399df00a8fc15e7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2344888629","DOI":"10.15562/GNC.25","CorpusId":"87346281"},"title":"Cell and Molecular Pathology of Dengue Viral Infection","abstract":"Dengue viral infection has been threatened to almost all Pakistanis and its reemergence in last few years has posed a major health challenge to the health policy makers of Pakistan.

Membrane-bound vacuoles carrying DENV particles have been documented in mosquito cells and play a role in the cell-to-cell transmission of DENV2. C189 is one member of the tetraspanin family and generally increases its expression as one component of the vacuoles (C189-VCs) within C6/36 cells infected with DENV2.

In addition, viral RNA was shown to spread from donor to recipient cells in a coculture assay even when 20 mM NH4Cl was added to inhibit virus replication in the culture. In an alternate assay using the transwell system, viral RNA was only detected in recipient cells in the absence of 40 mM NH4Cl, suggesting that cell-cell contact is required for the intercellular spread of DENV2. In turn, the formation of viral synapse (VS) derived from aggregates of viral particles was frequently observed at sites of cell contact.

Because dendritic cells (DC) in the skin and blood are the first target cells for DENV, we sought to investigate the early molecular events involved in the host response to the virus in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC). Using a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of DENV2-infected human Mo-DC, three major responses were identified within hours of infection - the activation of IRF3/7/STAT1 and NF-κB-driven antiviral and inflammatory networks, as well as the stimulation of an oxidative stress response that included the stimulation of an Nrf2-dependent antioxidant gene transcriptional program. DENV2 infection resulted in the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was dependent on NADPH-oxidase (NOX). A decrease in ROS levels through chemical or genetic inhibition of the NOX-complex dampened the innate immune responses to DENV infection and facilitated DENV replication; ROS were also essential in driving mitochondrial apoptosis in infected Mo-DC. In addition to stimulating innate immune responses to DENV, increased ROS led to the activation of bystander Mo-DC which up-regulated maturation/activation markers and were less susceptible to viral replication. We have identified a critical role for the transcription factor Nrf2 in limiting both antiviral and cell death responses to the virus by feedback modulation of oxidative stress. Silencing of Nrf2 by RNA interference increased DENV-associated immune and apoptotic responses.

The dengue 4 virus genome, a single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA, is flanked by two untranslated regions (UTR) located in the 5′ and 3′ ends. The 3′UTR in the minus-strand RNA [3′UTR (−)] has been thought to function as a promoter for the synthesis of plus-strand RNA. To study the initial interaction between this 3′UTR and cellular and viral proteins, mobility shift assays were performed, and four ribonucleoprotein complexes (I through IV) were formed when uninfected and infected U937 cells (human monocyte cell line) interacted with the 3′UTR (−) of dengue 4 virus. Cross-linking assays with RNAs containing the complete 3′UTR (−) (nucleotides [nt] 101 to 1) or a partial sequence from nt 101 to 45 and nt 44 to 1 resulted in specific binding of some cellular proteins. Supermobility shift and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the La protein forms part of these complexes. To determine the region in the 3′ UTR that interacted with the La protein, two deletion mutants were generated. The mutant (del-96), with a deletion of nt 96 to 101, was unable to interact with the La protein, suggesting that La interacted with the 5′ portion of the 3′UTR (−).

However, the involvement of cellular vimentin intermediate filaments in DENV replication has been explored less. Here, we revealed the direct interaction between host cellular vimentin and DENV nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A), a known component of the viral replication complex (RC), during DENV infection using tandem affinity purification, coimmunoprecipitation, and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the dynamics of vimentin-NS4A interaction were demonstrated by using confocal three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and proximity ligation assay. Most importantly, we report for the first time the discovery of the specific region of NS4A that interacts with vimentin lies within the first 50 amino acid residues at the cytosolic N-terminal domain of NS4A (N50 region). Besides identifying vimentin-NS4A interaction, vimentin reorganization and phosphorylation by calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II occurs during DENV infection, signifying that vimentin reorganization is important in maintaining and supporting the DENV RCs. Interestingly, we found that gene silencing of vimentin by small interfering RNA induced a significant alteration in the distribution of RCs in DENV-infected cells. This finding further supports the crucial role of intact vimentin scaffold in localizing and concentrating DENV RCs at the perinuclear site, thus facilitating efficient viral RNA replication.

Dengue begins as a febrile condition, and in certain patients, it can evolve severe clinical outcomes, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The reasons why certain patients develop DHF or DSS have not been thoroughly elucidated to date, and both patient and viral factors have been implicated. Previous work has shown that a severe immune dysfunction involving dendritic cells and T cells plays a key role in increasing the disease severity, especially in secondary heterologous infections. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous particles that are secreted by several cell types involved in homeostatic and pathological processes. Secretion of EVs by infected cells can enhance immune responses or favor viral evasion. In this study, we compare the molecular content of EVs that are secreted by human primary dendritic cells under different conditions: uninfected or infected with DENV3 strains isolated from patients with different infection phenotypes (a severe case involving DSS and a mild case). Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs) were infected with the dengue virus strains DENV3 5532 (severe) or DENV3 290 (mild), and the EVs were isolated. The presence of cup-shaped EVs was confirmed by electron microscopy and immunostaining with CD9, CD81, and CD83. The RNA content from the mdDC-infected cells contained several mRNAs and miRNAs related to immune responses compared to the EVs from mock-infected mdDCs. A number of these RNAs were detected exclusively during infection with DENV3 290 or DENV3 5532. This result suggests that the differential immune modulation of mdDCs by dengue strains can be achieved through the EV pathway. Additionally, we observed an association of EVs with DENV-infectious particles that seem to be protected from antibodies targeting the DENV envelope protein. We also showed that EVs derived from cells treated with IFN alpha have a protective effect against DENV infection in other cells. These results suggested that during DENV infection, the EV pathway could be exploited to favor viral viability, although immune mechanisms to counteract viral infection can also involve DC-derived EVs.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that EVs derived from cells treated with IFN alpha have a protective effect against DENV infection in other cells, although immune mechanisms to counteract viral infection can also involve DC-derived EVs."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5122,"details":{"paperId":"74eaa72b009ae8e449475ed27a5bc82dda04bf5b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2061241820","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.03453-14","CorpusId":"39987429","PubMed":"25568208"},"title":"Characterization of Dengue Virus NS4A and NS4B Protein Interaction","abstract":"ABSTRACT Flavivirus replication is mediated by a membrane-associated replication complex where viral membrane proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B serve as the scaffold for the replication complex formation. Here, we used dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) as a model to characterize viral NS4A-NS4B interaction. NS4A interacts with NS4B in virus-infected cells and in cells transiently expressing NS4A and NS4B in the absence of other viral proteins. Recombinant NS4A and NS4B proteins directly bind to each other with an estimated Kd (dissociation constant) of 50 nM. Amino acids 40 to 76 (spanning the first transmembrane domain, consisting of amino acids 50 to 73) of NS4A and amino acids 84 to 146 (also spanning the first transmembrane domain, consisting of amino acids 101 to 129) of NS4B are the determinants for NS4A-NS4B interaction. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis suggests that NS4A residues 17 to 80 form two amphipathic helices (helix α1, comprised of residues 17 to 32, and helix α2, comprised of residues 40 to 47) that associate with the cytosolic side of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and helix α3 (residues 52 to 75) that transverses the ER membrane. In addition, NMR analysis identified NS4A residues that may participate in the NS4A-NS4B interaction. Amino acid substitution of these NS4A residues exhibited distinct effects on viral replication. Three of the four NS4A mutations (L48A, T54A, and L60A) that affected the NS4A-NS4B interaction abolished or severely reduced viral replication; in contrast, two NS4A mutations (F71A and G75A) that did not affect NS4A-NS4B interaction had marginal effects on viral replication, demonstrating the biological relevance of the NS4A-NS4B interaction to DENV-2 replication. Taken together, the study has provided experimental evidence to argue that blocking the NS4A-NS4B interaction could be a potential antiviral approach. IMPORTANCE Flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins are essential components of the ER membrane-associated replication complex. The current study systematically characterizes the interaction between flavivirus NS4A and NS4B. Using DENV-2 as a model, we show that NS4A interacts with NS4B in virus-infected cells, in cells transiently expressing NS4A and NS4B proteins, or in vitro with recombinant NS4A and NS4B proteins.

It is well known that DENV E glycoprotein has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn67 and Asn153. The N-glycans of E glycoprotein have been shown to influence the proper folding of the protein, its cellular localization, its interactions with receptors and its immunogenicity. However, the precise structures of the N-glycans that are attached to E glycoprotein remain elusive, although the crystal structure of DENV E has been determined. This study characterized the structures of envelope protein N-linked glycans on mature DENV-2 particles derived from insect cells via an integrated method that used both lectin microarray and MALDI-TOF-MS. By combining these methods, a high heterogeneity of DENV N-glycans was found. Five types of N-glycan were identified on DENV-2, including mannose, GalNAc, GlcNAc, fucose and sialic acid; high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides and the galactosylation of N-glycans were the major structures that were found. Furthermore, a complex between a glycan on DENV and the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of DC-SIGN was mimicked with computational docking experiments.

Although high-resolution structural snapshots of viral fusion proteins in their prefusion and postfusion conformations are available, it has been difficult to define intermediate structures of the fusion pathway because of their transient nature. Flaviviruses possess a class II viral fusion protein (E) mediating fusion at acidic pH that is converted from a dimer to a trimer with a hairpin-like structure during the fusion process. Here we show for tick-borne encephalitis virus that exposure of virions to alkaline instead of acidic pH traps the particles in an intermediate conformation in which the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to the merger of the membranes. Further treatment to low pH, however, leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. Thus, the use of nonphysiological conditions allows a dissection of the flavivirus fusion process and the identification of two separate steps, in which membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers precedes the formation of hairpin-like trimers.

As RNA viruses, DENV rely on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to complete their life cycle. Alternatively, RBPs can act as restriction factors that prevent DENV multiplication. While the importance of RBPs is well-supported in humans, there is a dearth of information about their influence on DENV transmission by mosquitoes. Such knowledge could be harnessed to design novel, effective interventions against DENV. Here, we successfully adapted RNA-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry – a technique initially developed in mammalian cells – to identify RBPs in Ae. aegypti cells. We identified fourteen RBPs interacting with DENV serotype 2 3’UTR, which is involved in the viral multiplication and produces subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA). We validated the RNA affinity results for two RBPs by confirming that AePur binds the 3’UTR, whereas AeStaufen interacts with both 3’UTR and sfRNA. Using in vivo functional evaluation, we determined that RBPs like AeRan, AeExoRNase, and AeRNase have pro-viral functions, whereas AeGTPase, AeAtu, and AePur have anti-viral functions in mosquitoes. Furthermore, we showed that human and mosquito Pur homologs have a shared affinity to DENV2 RNA, although the anti-viral effect is specific to the mosquito protein. Importantly, we revealed that AeStaufen mediates a reduction of gRNA and sfRNA copies in several mosquito tissues, including the salivary glands and that AeStaufen-mediated sfRNA reduction diminishes the concentration of transmission-enhancing sfRNA in saliva, thereby revealing AeStaufen’s role in DENV transmission. By characterizing the first RBPs that bind to DENV2 3’UTR in mosquitoes, our study unravels new pro- and anti-viral targets for the design of novel therapeutic interventions as well as provides foundation for studying the role of RBPs in virus-vector interactions. Author abstract Dengue viruses are important human pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes. Currently, there are no effective control measures for dengue. The RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in mosquitoes, which bind to the dengue virus genome to regulate viral multiplication, could serve as new targets for developing therapeutic interventions. In this study, we pioneered the use of RNA-affinity chromatography – a technique that identifies proteins binding to specific RNA sequences – in mosquito cells. This led to the detection of fourteen RBPs that bind to the 3’UTR of dengue virus serotype 2. We validated our results using immunoprecipitation method. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 6 of the 14 RBPs influence viral multiplication in mosquitoes. Among these six RBPs, we showed that the AePur mosquito and human homologs share an affinity to dengue virus RNA, whereas the anti-viral function is specific to the mosquito homolog. Importantly, we revealed that AeStaufen mediates a reduction of genomic and subgenomic flaviviral RNAs in multiple mosquito tissues. We also showed that the reduction of subgenomic flaviviral RNA in salivary glands diminishes the secretion of salivary subgenomic RNA, which facilitates infection at the bite site, thereby unveiling the function of AeStaufen in the virus transmission.

The surface density of the DiD dye in the viral membrane was sufficiently high to largely quench the fluorescence intensity but still allowed clear detection of single virus particles. Fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane was evident as fluorescence dequenching. It was observed that DENV binds very inefficiently to the cells used, explaining at least in part the high infectious unit-to-particle ratio.

After biosynthesis E protein forms a heterodimer with precursor membrane (prM) protein.

Previously, we studied a series of C-terminal truncation constructs expressing DENV type 4 prM/E or E proteins and found the ectodomain of E protein alone could be recognized by all 12 mAbs tested, suggesting E protein ectodomain as a potential subunit immunogen without inducing anti-prM response. The characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated the expression, membrane association, glycosylation pattern, secretion and particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4 in the presence or absence of prM protein. E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi and contained primarily complex glycans, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane and contained high mannose glycans. In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter, as revealed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation with or without detergent and electron microscopy. Mutational analysis revealed that the secretion of E protein ectodomain was affected by N-linked glycosylation and could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride.

Dengue virus (DENV) occurs as four distinct serotypes, called DENV 1,2,3,and 4. Symptomatic DENV infection ranges from a self limited febrile illness, dengue fever (DF), to a more severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). DHF is characterized by increased capillary permeability resulting in decreased plasma volume, which may be accompanied by hemorrhagic manifestations. Many factors including T cell cross reactivity, viral burden, antibody dependent enhancement and induction of chemokines and cytokines have been reported in DHF and may play a role in the pathogenesis of DENV infection. Cytokines have been shown to modulate endothelial cell permeability [1-3]. Recent studies have shown that DENV-infected endothelial cells secrete the chemokine, interleukin (IL)-8 in vitro [4]. In addition, the permeability of an endothelial cell monolayer was found to be increased by interleukin-8 (IL-8) in vitro [5]. This thesis examines the effects of DEN2V infection on the induction of chemokines, and specifically, which DEN2V viral protein(s) are involved in the induction of IL-8. The chemokine induction profile following DEN2V infection was initially assessed in various cell lines that may represent potential targets in vivo , including monocytes, liver cells and endothelial cells. We hypothesized that distinct profiles of chemokine secretion can be induced by DEN2V infection of various cell types in vitro . We found RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted) and IL-8 were induced in two of the five cell lines. DEN2V infection of primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells induced RANTES and IL-8 along with macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), MIP-1β and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) but at an earlier time post infection than in the cell lines. These results showed that DEN2V infection induces distinct chemokine profiles in many cell types. In addition, monocytic-derived DCs can secrete chemokines upon infection with DEN2V. Characterization of the signaling pathways induced by DEN2V revealed that DEN2V induction of chemokines in human embryonic kidney (HEK293A) cells is mainly through the nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB) pathway, as previously reported for endothelial cells and 293T cells [4,6]. Alternatively, the liver cell line (HepG2) activated mainly activator protein (AP)-l. In addition, DENV infection can induce the activation of the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) driven promoter. IL-8 has been shown to have multiple effects on the immune system ranging from recruiting cells to the site of infection to countering the antiviral effects of type I interferon (IFN) [7,8].

Chronic depletion of vertebrate lipids reduced cell size and proliferation, although cells retained equivalent total intracellular lipids per cell by reducing lipolysis and modifying gene expression related to sugar and lipid metabolism.

Following infection, flaviviral RNA genomes are translated to produce the viral replication machinery but must then serve as a template for the transcription of new genomes. However, the ribosome and viral polymerase proceed in opposite directions along the RNA, risking collisions and abortive replication. Whilst generally linear, flavivirus genomes can adopt a circular conformation facilitated by long-range RNA–RNA interactions, shown to be essential for replication.

Dengue glycoprotein prM interacts with Arf4 and Arf5. Conclusion: Arf4 and Arf5 play a crucial role in dengue flavivirus secretion. Significance: Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism of dengue flavivirus secretion. Identification and characterization of virus-host interactions are very important steps toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression and pathogenesis. To date, very few cellular factors involved in the life cycle of flaviviruses, which are important human pathogens, have been described. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for class II Arf proteins (Arf4 and Arf5) in the dengue flavivirus life cycle. We show that simultaneous depletion of Arf4 and Arf5 blocks recombinant subviral particle secretion for all four dengue serotypes. Immunostaining analysis suggests that class II Arf proteins are required at an early pre-Golgi step for dengue virus secretion. Using a horseradish peroxidase protein fused to a signal peptide, we show that class II Arfs act specifically on dengue virus secretion without altering the secretion of proteins through the constitutive secretory pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate that the dengue prM glycoprotein interacts with class II Arf proteins but not through its C-terminal VXPX motif. Finally, experiments performed with replication-competent dengue and yellow fever viruses demonstrate that the depletion of class II Arfs inhibits virus secretion, thus confirming their implication in the virus life cycle, although data obtained with West Nile virus pointed out the differences in virus-host interactions among flaviviruses.

The flavivirus NS4A/NS4B cleavage site follows a long hydrophobic sequence. The polyprotein NS4A-NS4B-NS5 was cleaved at the NS4A/NS4B junction in the absence of other dengue virus functions. One interpretation for this finding is that NS4A/NS4B cleavage is mediated by a host protease, presumably a signal peptidase.

In addition, several key signaling genes were expressed as common responsive genes in both susceptible and refractory mosquitoes that may be necessary for signal transduction to trigger the appropriate host response to the viral infection. These are coordinately expressed in the form of tight gene networks and expression clusters that may be necessary to differentially contribute to the progression of dengue infection between the two strains.

Prior studies showed that MBL-dependent activation of the complement cascade neutralized insect cell-derived West Nile virus (WNV) in cell culture and restricted pathogenesis in mice. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of MBL in infection by dengue virus (DENV), a related flavivirus. Using a panel of naïve sera from mouse strains deficient in different complement components, we showed that inhibition of infection by insect cell- and mammalian cell-derived DENV was primarily dependent on the lectin pathway. Human MBL also bound to DENV and neutralized infection of all four DENV serotypes through complement activation-dependent and -independent pathways. Experiments with human serum from naïve individuals with inherent variation in the levels of MBL in blood showed a direct correlation between the concentration of MBL and neutralization of DENV; samples with high levels of MBL in blood neutralized DENV more efficiently than those with lower levels. Our studies suggest that allelic variation of MBL in humans may impact complement-dependent control of DENV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes a spectrum of clinical disease in humans ranging from subclinical infection to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Four serotypes of DENV exist, and severe illness is usually associated with secondary infection by a different serotype. Here, we show that mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a pattern recognition molecule that initiates the lectin pathway of complement activation, neutralized infection of all four DENV serotypes through complement activation-dependent and -independent pathways. Moreover, we observed a direct correlation with the concentration of MBL in human serum and neutralization of DENV infection. Our studies suggest that common genetic polymorphisms that result in disparate levels and function of MBL in humans may impact DENV infection, pathogenesis, and disease severity.

Herein, we report that a viral recognition cascade composed of two complement-related proteins limits the flaviviral infection of Aedes aegypti. An A. aegypti macroglobulin complement-related factor (AaMCR), belonging to the insect TEP family, is a crucial effector in opposing the flaviviral infection of A. aegypti. However, AaMCR does not directly interact with DENV, and its antiviral effect requires an A. aegypti homologue of scavenger receptor-C (AaSR-C), which interacts with DENV and AaMCR simultaneously in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, recognition of DENV by the AaSR-C/AaMCR axis regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which exerts potent anti-DENV activity.

This demonstration of the protective role of T-cell responses points the way forward to identifying robust correlates of protection in natural immunity and vaccination against dengue virus. The role of CD8+ T cells in dengue virus infection and subsequent disease manifestations is not fully understood. According to the original antigenic sin theory, skewing of T-cell responses induced by primary infection with one serotype causes less effective response upon secondary infection with a different serotype, predisposing individuals to severe disease. A comprehensive analysis of CD8+ responses in the general population from the Sri Lankan hyperendemic area, involving the measurement of ex vivo IFNγ responses associated with more than 400 epitopes, challenges the original antigenic sin theory. Although skewing of responses toward primary infecting viruses was detected, this was not associated with impairment of responses either qualitatively or quantitatively.

The helicase performs the unwinding of the viral RNA intermediate structure in an ATP‐dependent manner.

We have studied the contributions to translational expression of 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of the DEN serotype 2 genome by using luciferase reporter mRNAs transfected into Vero cells. DCLD RNA contained the entire DEN 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), as well as the first 36 codons of the capsid coding region fused to the luciferase reporter gene. Capped DCLD RNA was as efficiently translated in Vero cells as capped GLGpA RNA, a reporter with UTRs from the highly expressed α-globin mRNA and a 72-residue poly(A) tail. Analogous reporter RNAs with regulatory sequences from West Nile and Sindbis viruses were also strongly expressed. Although capped DCLD RNA was expressed much more efficiently than its uncapped form, uncapped DCLD RNA was translated 6 to 12 times more efficiently than uncapped RNAs with UTRs from globin mRNA. The 5′ cap and DEN 3′ UTR were the main sources of the translational efficiency of DCLD RNA, and they acted synergistically in enhancing translation. The DEN 3′ UTR increased mRNA stability, although this effect was considerably weaker than the enhancement of translational efficiency. The DEN 3′ UTR thus has translational regulatory properties similar to those of a poly(A) tail. Its translation-enhancing effect was observed for RNAs with globin or DEN 5′ sequences, indicating no codependency between viral 5′ and 3′ sequences. Deletion studies showed that translational enhancement provided by the DEN 3′ UTR is attributable to the cumulative contributions of several conserved elements, as well as a nonconserved domain adjacent to the stop codon. One of the conserved elements was the conserved sequence (CS) CS1 that is complementary to cCS1 present in the 5′ end of the DEN polyprotein open reading frame.

As expected, transfection of pKUN1 plasmid DNA into BHK cells resulted in the recovery of secreted infectious Kunjin virions. Transfection of pKUN1dGDD DNA into BHK cells, however, did not result in the recovery of any secreted virus particles containing encapsidated dGDD RNA, despite an apparent accumulation of this RNA in cells demonstrated by Northern blot analysis and its efficient translation demonstrated by detection of correctly processed labeled structural proteins (at least prM and E) both in cells and in the culture fluid using coimmunoprecipitation analysis with anti-E antibodies. In contrast, when dGDD RNA was produced even in much smaller amounts in pKUN1dGDD DNA-transfected repBHK cells (where it was replicated via complementation), it was packaged into secreted virus particles. Thus, packaging of defective Kunjin virus RNA could occur only when it was replicated. Our results with genome-length Kunjin virus RNA and the results with poliovirus replicon RNA (C. I. Nugent et al., J.

In endothelial cells (HMEC-1), a cell model for DENV-2 infection, alpha 5 beta 3 integrin has been identified as a putative receptor for the virus. Previous work had suggested that the actin cytoskeleton of HMEC-1 cells plays an important role in virus entry and infection. In the present work, fixed and living HMEC-1 cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-actin were monitored for actin reorganization after virus inoculation, utilizing fluorescence and time lapse microscopy. Cell infection and production of infective viruses were quantified using an anti-E protein antibody and by measuring the p.f.u. ml(-1). Specific drugs that antagonize actin organization and regulate actin-signalling pathways were tested in viral adhesion and infection assays, as were the expression of dominant-negative Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins. Disorganization of actin precluded infection, while microtubule depolymerization had no effect. Activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 signalling, which occurs upon virus binding, induced reorganization of actin to form filopodia in the cellular periphery. Formation of filopodia was a requirement for virus entry and further cell infection.

ABSTRACT The positive-sense flavivirus RNA genome bears a cap 1 structure essential for RNA stability and viral protein translation, and the formation of cap 1 requires the virally encoded nonstructural protein NS5 harboring guanylyltransferase (GTase), cap guanine N7 methyltransferase (N7 MTase), and 5′-nucleotide ribose 2′-O MTase activities in its single-domain MTase module. Despite numerous MTase-containing structures reported, the structural evidence for a critical GMP-enzyme intermediate formation and RNA repositioning when transitioning among different reactions is missing. Here, we report 10 high-resolution MTase crystal structures of Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), a representative high-consequence tick-borne flavivirus, capturing previously unidentified GMP-arginine adduct structures and a rarely observed capped RNA conformation. These structures help us thread capping events in the canonical model with a structure-based hypothesis involving the flipping of the 5′ nucleotide, while the observation of an m7GMP-arginine adduct is compatible with an alternate capping model that decouples the N7 and 2′-O methylation steps.

However, the detailed mechanisms of the multistep capping process remain elusive. Here, we report 10 crystal structures of a flavivirus MTase to help understand the guanylyl transfer from GTP to the GTase itself and the transition between guanylyl transfer and methylation steps. In particular, a previously unobserved GMP-arginine covalent intermediate was captured multiple times in MTase crystal soaking trials with GTP present in the soaking solution, supporting its role in bridging the guanylyl transfer from GTP to the GTase and subsequent transfer to the 5′-diphosphate RNA.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"10 crystal structures of a flavivirus MTase are reported to help understand the guanylyl transfer from GTP to the GTase itself and the transition between guanyl transfer and methylation steps and thread capping events in the canonical model with a structure-based hypothesis."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1280,"details":{"paperId":"3ce2e141034a1a89e65ab4decafc4beb19023ee0","externalIds":{"MAG":"2007449377","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.03.008","CorpusId":"34053307","PubMed":"19275894"},"title":"Crystal structure of a methyltransferase from a no-known-vector Flavivirus.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Analysis of the conserved residues throughout all the sequenced flaviviral methyltransferases reveals that, besides the central cleft hosting the substrate and cofactor binding sites, a second patch is conserved and points away from active site towards the back of the protein."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1130,"details":{"paperId":"26e82cce03469abfec5db32853ecc9787c89150c","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7113791","MAG":"2069296387","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.09.003","CorpusId":"128341","PubMed":"25241250"},"title":"Crystal structure of dengue virus methyltransferase without S-adenosyl-L-methionine","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results clearly indicate that the SAM molecule is not an essential component for the correct folding of DENV methyltransferase, and imply a potential antiviral approach to search for inhibitors that can bind to the SAM-binding pocket and compete against SAM binding."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4289,"details":{"paperId":"e2119fac29a2d5fd76b0bf28ab648875cd12f1da","externalIds":{"MAG":"3101601515","DOI":"10.1101/2020.01.27.907089","CorpusId":"213249687"},"title":"Crystal structures of full length DENV4 NS2B-NS3 reveal the dynamic interaction between NS2B and NS3","abstract":"Flavivirus is a genus of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses which include many significant human pathogens.

A number of studies indicate that NS2B-NS3pro undergoes a transition between two widely different conformational states: an \"open\" (inactive) conformation and a \"closed\" (active) conformation. For the past several years, the equilibrium between these states and the resting conformation of NS2B-NS3pro have been debated, although a strong consensus is emerging. To investigate the importance of such conformational states, we developed versions of NS2B-NS3pro that allow us to trap the enzyme in various distinct conformations. Our data from these variants suggest that the enzymatic activity appears to be dependent on the movement of NS2B and may rely on the flexibility of the protease core. Locking the enzyme into the \"closed\" conformation dramatically increased activity, strongly suggesting that the \"closed\" conformation is the active conformation. The observed resting state of the enzyme depends largely on the construct used to express the NS2B-NS3pro complex. In an \"unlinked\" construct, in which the NS2B and NS3 regions exist as independent, co-expressed polypeptides, the enzyme rests predominantly in a \"closed\", active conformation. In contrast, in a \"linked\" construct, in which NS2B and NS3 are attached by a nine-amino acid linker, NS2B-NS3pro adopts a more relaxed, alternative conformation. Nevertheless, even the unlinked construct samples both the \"closed\" and other alternative conformations. Given our findings, and the more realistic resemblance of NS2B-NS3pro to the native enzyme, these data strongly suggest that studies should focus on the \"unlinked\" constructs moving forward.

T cells provide protective immunity against various viral infections by generating effector cells that cooperate to eliminate antigens and memory cells that can survive for long periods with enhanced abilities to control recurring pathogens.

Importantly, accumulating studies demonstrate that cytotoxic CD4 T cells develop following DENV infections and may play a crucial role in protecting the host from severe dengue disease.

We reason that variations in the DC-SIGN gene might have a broad influence on viral replication and host immune responses. Methods and Findings We studied whether the rs4804803 SNP was associated with a susceptibility to dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) through genotyping analysis in a Taiwanese cohort. We generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 to study the viral replication and immune responses for functional validation. A total of 574 DNA samples were genotyped, including 176 DF, 135 DHF, 143 other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) and 120 population controls. A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 and risk of DHF was found when compared among DF, OFI and controls (p = 0.004, 3×10−5 and 0.001, respectively). The AA genotype was associated with protection against dengue infection compared with OFI and controls (p = 0.002 and 0.020, respectively). Moreover, MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype with a higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression had a significantly higher TNFα, IL-12p40, and IP-10 production than those with AA genotype in response to dengue infection. However, the viral replication in MDDCs with AG genotype was significantly lower than those with AA genotype. With both genotypes, MDDCs revealed an increase in viral replication following the addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody.

It replicates in a wide range of cells involved in the immune response. To efficiently infect humans, DENV must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon response. DENV circumvents the host immune response by expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate immunity. We have recently documented the inhibition of type I IFN production by the proteolytic activity of DENV NS2B3 protease complex in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). In the present report we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the NS2B3 protease complex. We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor. Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication. Conversely, mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV.

Vascular leakage is a common clinical crisis in DHF/DSS patients which is closely associated with increased endothelial permeability. The presence of vascular leakage causes hypotension, circulatory failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation as the disease progresses, which can lead to death under such conditions. However, the mechanisms by which DENV infection caused the vascular leakage are not fully understood. This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which DENV induces endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mice tissues. We initially show that DENV2 promotes the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression and secretion in DHF patient serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages, and further reveal that DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) induces MMP-9 expression through activating the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Additionally, NS1 inhibits TIMP-1 expression to facilitates the MMP-9 enzymatic activity which alters the adhesion and tight junctions and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mouse tissues. Moreover, NS1 recruits MMP-9 to interact with β-catenin and Zona occludins protein-1/2 to degrade the important adhesion and tight junction proteins, thereby inducing endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mouse tissues. Thus, we reveal that DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperatively induce vascular leakage by impairing endothelial cell adhesion and tight junction, and suggest that MMP-9 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of hypovolemia in DSS/DHF patients. Author Summary DENV is the most common mosquito-transmitted viral pathogen in humans. In general, DENV-infected patients are either asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms with fever and rash. However, in severe cases of DENV infection, the disease may progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in school-age children in tropical and subtropical regions. DENV-induced vascular leakage is characterized by enhanced vascular permeability without morphological damage to the capillary endothelium. We found that a distinct mechanism of DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperatively induce vascular leakage is the main reason leading to death in severe dengue patients. Also, NS1 recruits MMP-9 to degrade β-catenin, ZO-1, ZO-2 to intervene endothelial hyperpermeability in human endothelial cells and mouse vascular. Finally, we reveal that DENV activating NF-κB signaling pathway induces MMP-9 expression, in patients, mice, PBMC and macrophages though the viral NS1 protein. This study would provide new in signs into the pathogenesis caused by DENV infection, and suggest that MMP-9 may acts as a drug target for the prevention and treatment of DENV-associated diseases.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"DENV-induced vascular leakage is characterized by enhanced vascular permeability without morphological damage to the capillary endothelium, and it is suggested that MMP-9 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of hypovolemia in DSS/DHF patients."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7833,"details":{"paperId":"867d6dfa26606c1f6ceeab99afcf3379e74ebb3d","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7019998","MAG":"2998435200","DOI":"10.3390/v12010027","CorpusId":"209499976","PubMed":"31881703"},"title":"DENV2 Pseudoviral Particles with Unprocessed Capsid Protein Are Assembled and Infectious","abstract":"Proteolytic processing of flavivirus polyprotein is a uniquely controlled process.

Here, we found that STING haplotype frequency varies among different subhuman populations, and different haplotypes respond differently to DENV protease. The cleavage of a DENV protease-sensitive STING can be further enhanced by coculture with neighboring cells producing 2′3′-cGAMP, either by DNA transfection of cGAS or by reactivating Epstein–Barr virus from latent infection. Thus, DENV infection trims down human STING-mediated innate immunity in a haplotype-specific manner. The genetic background of host STING and bystander coinfection of pathogens triggering 2′3′-cGAMP production may be the missing link between STING cleavage and DENV pathogenesis. The cytosolic DNA sensor cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) synthesizes the noncanonical cyclic dinucleotide 2′3′-cGAMP to activate the adaptor protein stimulator of IFN genes (STING), thus awakening host immunity in response to DNA pathogen infection. However, dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus without a DNA stage in its life cycle, also manipulates cGAS-STING–mediated innate immunity by proteolytic degradation of STING. Here, we found that the sensitivity of STING to DENV protease varied with different human STING haplotypes. Exogenous DNA further enhanced DENV protease’s ability to interact and cleave protease-sensitive STING. DNA-enhanced STING cleavage was reduced in cGAS-knockdown cells and triggered by the cGAS product 2′3′-cGAMP. The source of DNA may not be endogenous mitochondrial DNA but rather exogenous reactivated viral DNA. Cells producing 2′3′-cGAMP by overexpressing cGAS or with DNA virus reactivation enhanced STING cleavage in neighboring cells harboring DENV protease. DENV infection reduced host innate immunity in cells with the protease-sensitive STING haplotype, whose homozygote genotype frequency was found significantly reduced in Taiwanese people with dengue fever.

However, no specific treatment has been developed, due to the lack of information about their detailed pathogenic mechanisms. In the current study, we reveal that the transport of viral RNA of tick-borne flavivirus in neuronal dendrites is involved in the development of neurological disease. The virus hijacked the transport system of host mRNA in dendrites, which is important for neuronal functions such as neurogenesis and the plasticity of the synaptic communication. Our finding of this unique virus–host interaction will promote the study of neurodegenerative diseases caused by disruption of dendritic mRNA transport and the development of their treatment. Neurological diseases caused by encephalitic flaviviruses are severe and associated with high levels of mortality. However, little is known about the detailed mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenicity in the brain. Previously, we reported that the genomic RNA of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, is transported and replicated in the dendrites of neurons. In the present study, we analyzed the transport mechanism of the viral genome to dendrites. We identified specific sequences of the 5′ untranslated region of TBEV genomic RNA that act as a cis-acting element for RNA transport. Mutated TBEV with impaired RNA transport in dendrites caused a reduction in neurological symptoms in infected mice. We show that neuronal granules, which regulate the transport and local translation of dendritic mRNAs, are involved in TBEV genomic RNA transport.

Dengue virus (DV) NS3 reverts the GFP expression in GFP-silenced cell lines. Pull-down assays of dvNS3 revealed that it interacts with the host factor human heat shock cognate 70 (hHSC70). Down-regulation of hHSC70 resulted in accumulation of dengue viral genomic RNA. Also, the interaction of dvNS3 with hHSC70 perturbs the formation of RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)-loading complex (RLC), by displacing TRBP (TAR RNA-binding protein) and possibly impairing the downstream activity of miRNAs. Interestingly, some of these miRNAs have earlier been reported to be down-regulated upon DV infection in Huh7 cells.

Since macrophages are a primary cell target in vivo for DV infection, we investigated the potential antiviral role of TNF-α in regulating DV replication in MDM. While pretreatment of MDM with TNF-α had a minor inhibitory effect, addition of TNF-α to MDM with established DV infection had no effect on DV replication as measured by DV RNA levels or progeny virus production. Blocking endogenous TNF-α using short interfering RNA or inhibitory TNF-α antibodies also had no effect on infectious DV production or viral RNA synthesis. Together, these results demonstrate that DV replication in MDM is not affected by TNF-α. Additionally, normal cellular TNF-α signaling, measured by quantitation of TNF-α-induced stimulation of transcription from an NF-κB-responsive reporter plasmid or NF-κB protein nuclear translocation, was blocked in DV-infected MDM and Huh7 cells.

Plasma leakage/hemorrhages can be caused by a cytokine storm induced by monocytes and dendritic cells during dengue virus (DENV) replication. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are innate immune cells and in response to virus exposure secrete IFN-α and express membrane TRAIL (mTRAIL). We aimed to characterize pDC activation in dengue patients and their function under DENV-2 stimulation in vitro. Methods & Findings Flow cytometry analysis (FCA) revealed that pDCs of mild dengue patients exhibit significantly higher frequencies of mTRAIL compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IFN-α and soluble TRAIL are increased in mild compared to severe dengue patients, positively correlating with pDC activation. FCA experiments showed that in vitro exposure to DENV-2 induced mTRAIL expression on pDC. Furthermore, three dimension microscopy highlighted that TRAIL was relocalized from intracellular compartment to plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited DENV-2-induced mTRAIL relocalization and IFN-α production by pDC. Endosomal viral degradation blockade by chloroquine allowed viral antigens detection inside pDCs. All those data are in favor of endocytosis pathway activation by DENV-2 in pDC. Coculture of pDC/DENV-2-infected monocytes revealed a dramatic decrease of antigen detection by FCA. This viral antigens reduction in monocytes was also observed after exogenous IFN-α treatment. Thus, pDC effect on viral load reduction was mainly dependent on IFN-α production Conclusions This investigation characterizes, during DENV-2 infection, activation of pDCs in vivo and their antiviral role in vitro.

The autophagic mobilization of lipids leads to increased β-oxidation in DENV-infected cells. The mechanism by which DENV induces lipophagy is unknown. Here, we show that infection with DENV activates the metabolic regulator 5′ adenosine-monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), and that the silencing or pharmacological inhibition of AMPK activity decreases DENV replication and the induction of lipophagy. The activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) decreases in DENV-infected cells and is inversely correlated with lipophagy induction. Constitutive activation of mTORC1 by depletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) inhibits lipophagy induction in DENV-infected cells and decreases viral replication. While AMPK normally stimulates TSC2-dependent inactivation of mTORC1 signaling, mTORC1 inactivation is independent of AMPK activation during DENV infection. Thus, DENV stimulates and requires AMPK signaling as well as AMPK-independent suppression of mTORC1 activity for proviral lipophagy. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus alters host cell lipid metabolism to promote its infection. One mechanism for altered metabolism is the induction of a selective autophagy that targets lipid droplets, termed lipophagy. Lipophagy mobilizes lipid stores, resulting in enhanced β-oxidation and viral replication.

Here, we characterized the properties of the interaction between the DENV capsid (C) protein and hepatic lipid droplets (LDs), which was recently shown to be essential for the virus replication cycle. Zeta potential analysis revealed a negative surface charge of LDs, with an average surface charge of −19 mV. The titration of LDs with C protein led to an increase of the surface charge, which reached a plateau at +13.7 mV, suggesting that the viral protein-LD interaction exposes the protein cationic surface to the aqueous environment. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy measurements were performed by using C protein-functionalized AFM tips. The C protein-LD interaction was found to be strong, with a single (un)binding force of 33.6 pN. This binding was dependent on high intracellular concentrations of potassium ions but not sodium. The inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase in DENV-infected cells resulted in the dissociation of C protein from LDs and a 50-fold inhibition of infectious virus production but not of RNA replication, indicating a biological relevance for the potassium-dependent interaction.

Mutagenesis analysis using infectious dengue virus clones has identified specific hydrophobic amino acids, located in the center of the capsid protein, as key elements for lipid droplet association. Substitutions of amino acid L50 or L54 in the capsid protein disrupted lipid droplet targeting and impaired viral particle formation. We also report that dengue virus infection increases the number of lipid droplets per cell, suggesting a link between lipid droplet metabolism and viral replication. In this regard, we found that pharmacological manipulation of the amount of lipid droplets in the cell can be a means to control dengue virus replication.

Despite the prevalence and potential severity of DF and DHF, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics available. An improved understanding of DENV immune evasion is pivotal for the rational development of anti-DENV therapeutics. Antagonism of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is a crucial mechanism of DENV immune evasion. DENV NS5 protein inhibits IFN-I signaling by mediating proteasome-dependent STAT2 degradation. Only proteolytically-processed NS5 can efficiently mediate STAT2 degradation, though both unprocessed and processed NS5 bind STAT2. Here we identify UBR4, a 600-kDa member of the N-recognin family, as an interacting partner of DENV NS5 that preferentially binds to processed NS5.

However, in recent years, it was shown that DENV evades the innate immune response by blocking type I interferon (IFN-I). It has been demonstrated that DENV can inhibit both the production and the signaling of IFN-I. The viral proteins, NS2A and NS3, inhibit IFN-I production by degrading cellular signaling molecules.

Dengue virus (DENV) infection disrupts host innate immune signaling at various checkpoints. Cellular levels and stability of intermediate signaling molecules are a crucial hijacking point for a successful viral pathogenesis. Stability and turnover of all the cellular proteins including intermediate signaling molecules are principally regulated by proteasomal degradation pathway. In this study, we show that how DENV infection and particularly DENV-NS1 can modulate the host extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo to manipulate the deubiquitination machinery of the human microglial cell (CHME3). We have performed EV harvesting, size analysis by nanoparticle tracking analysis, identification of cargo microRNA via quantitative PCR, microRNA target validation by overexpression, and knockdown via mimics and anti-miRs, immunoblotting, dual luciferase reporter assay, in vivo ubiquitination assay, chase assay, and promoter activity assay to reach the conclusion. In this study, we show that DENV-infected monocytes and DENV-NS1–transfected cells release high amounts of EVs loaded with miR-148a. These EVs get internalized by human microglial cells, and miR-148a suppresses the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 33 (USP33) protein expression levels via binding to its 3′ untranslated region. Reduced USP33 in turn decreases the stability of cellular ATF3 protein via deubiquitylation. ATF3 acts as a suppressor of major proinflammatory gene expression pathways of TNF-α, NF-κB, and IFN-β.

Are there any cofactors that time DEN fusion to virion entry into late endosomes? Here we show that DEN utilizes bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a lipid specific to late endosomes, as a co-factor for its endosomal acidification-dependent fusion machinery. Effective virus fusion to plasma- and intracellular- membranes, as well as to protein-free liposomes, requires the target membrane to contain anionic lipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and phosphatidylserine. Anionic lipids act downstream of low-pH-dependent fusion stages and promote the advance from the earliest hemifusion intermediates to the fusion pore opening. To reach anionic lipid-enriched late endosomes, DEN travels through acidified early endosomes, but we found that low pH-dependent loss of fusogenic properties of DEN is relatively slow in the presence of anionic lipid-free target membranes. We propose that anionic lipid-dependence of DEN fusion machinery protects it against premature irreversible restructuring and inactivation and ensures viral fusion in late endosomes, where the virus encounters anionic lipids for the first time during entry.

Flaviviruses are mainly arthropod-borne viruses, including emerging and reemerging pathogens such as dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses. Currently, dengue virus is one of the most significant human viral pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes and is responsible for about 390 million infections every year around the world. Here, we examined for the first time molecular aspects of dengue virus genome uncoating. We followed the fate of the capsid protein and RNA genome early during infection and found that capsid is degraded after viral internalization by the host ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, proteasome activity and capsid degradation were not necessary to free the genome for initial viral translation. Unexpectedly, genome uncoating was blocked by inhibiting ubiquitination. Using different assays to bypass entry and evaluate the first rounds of viral translation, a narrow window of time during infection that requires ubiquitination but not proteasome activity was identified. In this regard, ubiquitin E1-activating enzyme inhibition was sufficient to stabilize the incoming viral genome in the cytoplasm of infected cells, causing its retention in either endosomes or nucleocapsids. Our data support a model in which dengue virus genome uncoating requires a nondegradative ubiquitination step, providing new insights into this crucial but understudied viral process. IMPORTANCE Dengue is the most significant arthropod-borne viral infection in humans. Although the number of cases increases every year, there are no approved therapeutics available for the treatment of dengue infection, and many basic aspects of the viral biology remain elusive. After entry, the viral membrane must fuse with the endosomal membrane to deliver the viral genome into the cytoplasm for translation and replication.

Here, we investigated the fate of nucleocapsid components (capsid protein and viral genome) during the infection process and found that capsid is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, in contrast to that observed for other RNA and DNA viruses, dengue virus capsid degradation was not responsible for genome uncoating.

We employed a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) screen to identify host dependency factors required for DENV propagation and identified the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex as an essential host factor for DENV infection. Mammalian cells express two OSTs containing either STT3A or STT3B. We found that the canonical catalytic function of the OSTs as oligosaccharyltransferases is not necessary for DENV infection, as cells expressing catalytically inactive STT3A or STT3B are able to support DENV propagation. However, the OST subunit MAGT1, which associates with STT3B, is also required for DENV propagation. MAGT1 expression requires STT3B, and a catalytically inactive STT3B also rescues MAGT1 expression, supporting the hypothesis that STT3B serves to stabilize MAGT1 in the context of DENV infection. We found that the oxidoreductase CXXC active site motif of MAGT1 was necessary for DENV propagation, as cells expressing an AXXA MAGT1 mutant were unable to support DENV infection. Interestingly, cells expressing single-cysteine CXXA or AXXC mutants of MAGT1 were able to support DENV propagation. Utilizing the engineered peroxidase APEX2, we demonstrate the close proximity between MAGT1 and NS1 or NS4B during DENV infection. These results reveal that the oxidoreductase activity of the STT3B-containing OST is necessary for DENV infection, which may guide the development of antiviral agents targeting DENV.

Here, the molecular changes in components of the AP during DENV infection in vitro were investigated. mRNA for factor H (FH), a major negative regulator of the AP, was significantly increased in DENV-infected endothelial cells (EC) and macrophages, but, in contrast, production of extracellular FH protein was not. This discord was not seen for the AP activator factor B (FB), with DENV induction of both FB mRNA and protein, nor was it seen with Toll-like receptor 3 or 4 stimulation of EC and macrophages, which induces both FH and FB mRNA and protein. Surface-bound and intracellular FH protein was, however, induced by DENV, but only in DENV antigen-positive cells, while in two other DENV-susceptible immortalized cell lines (ARPE-19 and human retinal endothelial cells), FH protein was induced both intracellularly and extracellularly by DENV infection. Regardless of the cell type, there was an imbalance in AP components and an increase in markers of complement AP activity associated with DENV-infected cells, with lower FH relative to FB protein, an increased ability to promote AP-mediated lytic activity, and increased deposition of complement component C3b on the surface of DENV-infected cells. For EC in particular, these changes are predicted to result in higher complement activity in the local cellular microenvironment, with the potential to induce functional changes that may result in increased vascular permeability, a hallmark of dengue disease.

The pathogenic mechanisms underlying these features remain unclear; however, overactivity of the complement alternative pathway has been suggested to play a role. In this study, we investigate the molecular events that may be responsible for this observed alternative pathway overactivity and provide novel findings of changes in the complement system in response to DENV infection in primary cell types that are a major target for DENV infection (macrophages) and pathogenesis (endothelial cells) in vivo. Our results suggest a new dimension of cellular events that may influence endothelial cell barrier function during DENV infection that could expand strategies for developing therapeutics to prevent or control DENV-mediated vascular disease.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest a new dimension of cellular events that may influence endothelial cell barrier function during DENV infection that could expand strategies for developing therapeutics to prevent or control DENV-mediated vascular disease."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5482,"details":{"paperId":"4aaa70458cfd257e4af819619bad052e3e440ffd","externalIds":{"MAG":"2750792172","PubMedCentral":"5605866","DOI":"10.1155/2017/5649214","CorpusId":"7974709","PubMed":"29038620"},"title":"Dengue Virus Induces NK Cell Activation through TRAIL Expression during Infection","abstract":"Dengue is an acute febrile illness with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms ranging from mild to severe forms characterized by plasma leakage that can be fatal.

Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is one of the most important arthropod-borne human pathogens worldwide. We analyzed global intracellular metabolic changes associated with DENV infection of primary human cells. Our metabolic profiling data suggested that central carbon metabolism, particularly glycolysis, is strikingly altered during a time course of DENV infection. Glucose consumption is increased during DENV infection and depriving DENV-infected cells of exogenous glucose had a pronounced impact on viral replication. Furthermore, the expression of both glucose transporter 1 and hexokinase 2, the first enzyme of glycolysis, is upregulated in DENV-infected cells. Pharmacologically inhibiting the glycolytic pathway dramatically reduced DENV RNA synthesis and infectious virion production, revealing a requirement for glycolysis during DENV infection. Thus, these experiments suggest that DENV induces the glycolytic pathway to support efficient viral replication. This study raises the possibility that metabolic inhibitors, such as those that target glycolysis, could be used to treat DENV infection in the future. IMPORTANCE Approximately 400 million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV) annually, and more than one-third of the global population is at risk of infection. As there are currently no effective vaccines or specific antiviral therapies for DENV, we investigated the impact DENV has on the host cellular metabolome to identify metabolic pathways that are critical for the virus life cycle. We report an essential role for glycolysis during DENV infection. DENV activates the glycolytic pathway, and inhibition of glycolysis significantly blocks infectious DENV production.

A similar phenomenon occurs after exposure of platelets to thrombin, an agonist extensively used for in vitro activation of these cells. It was recently reported that the dengue virus not only interacts with platelets but possibly infects them, which triggers an increased expression of adhesion molecule P-selectin as well as secretion of IL-1β. In the present study, surface molecules of platelets like CD40L, CD42b, CD62P, and MHC class I were evaluated at 4 h of interaction with dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2), finding that DENV-2 induced a sharp rise in the membrane expression of all these molecules. At 2 and 4 h of DENV-2 stimulation of platelets, a significantly greater secretion of soluble CD40L (sCD40L) was found (versus basal levels) as well as cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α.

It produces numerous immune factors, as well as immune-modulatory, vasodilatory, and anti-coagulant molecules that facilitate blood-feeding. To assess the impact of DENV infection on salivary gland physiology and function, we performed a comparative genome-wide microarray analysis of the naïve and DENV infection-responsive A. aegypti salivary gland transcriptomes. DENV infection resulted in the regulation of 147 transcripts that represented a variety of functional classes, including several that are essential for virus transmission, such as immunity, blood-feeding, and host-seeking. RNAi-mediated gene silencing of three DENV infection-responsive genes - a cathepsin B, a putative cystatin, and a hypothetical ankyrin repeat-containing protein - significantly modulated DENV replication in the salivary gland. Furthermore, silencing of two DENV infection-responsive odorant-binding protein genes (OBPs) resulted in an overall compromise in blood acquisition from a single host by increasing the time for initiation of probing and the probing time before a successful bloodmeal. We also show that DENV established an extensive infection in the mosquito's main olfactory organs, the antennae, which resulted in changes of the transcript abundance of key host-seeking genes. DENV infection, however, did not significantly impact probing initiation or probing times in our laboratory infection system.

In this study, the mechanism of hair loss caused by DENV was explored. Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) are essential for hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. Thus, we established an in vitro DENV infection model in HFDPCs. On immunofluorescence analysis, HFDPCs that were susceptible to DENV infection responded to type I interferon (IFN) treatment, and the cells showed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), revealed an inflammatory response in DENV-infected HFDPCs. In particular, DENV infection impaired cell viability, and it activated caspase-associated cell death signaling in HFDPCs. In conclusion, our data indicate that direct infection with DENV causes inflammation and cell death in HFDPCs, which is involved in the mechanisms of hair loss after DENV infection.

Autophagy can either promote or restrict viral replication. In the case of Dengue virus (DENV), several studies report that autophagy supports the viral replication cycle, and describe an increase of autophagic vesicles (AVs) following infection. However, it is unknown how autophagic flux is altered to result in increased AVs. To address this question and gain insight into the role of autophagy during DENV infection, we established an unbiased, image-based flow cytometry approach to quantify autophagic flux under normal growth conditions and in response to activation by nutrient deprivation or the mTOR inhibitor Torin1. We found that DENV induced an initial activation of autophagic flux, followed by inhibition of general and specific autophagy. Early after infection, basal and activated autophagic flux was enhanced. However, during established replication, basal and Torin1-activated autophagic flux was blocked, while autophagic flux activated by nutrient deprivation was reduced, indicating a block to AV formation and reduced AV degradation capacity. During late infection AV levels increased as a result of inefficient fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition, endolysosomal trafficking was suppressed, while lysosomal activities were increased. We further determined that DENV infection progressively reduced levels of the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 via proteasomal degradation. Importantly, stable overexpression of p62 significantly suppressed DENV replication, suggesting a novel role for p62 as a viral restriction factor. Overall, our findings indicate that in the course of DENV infection, autophagy shifts from a supporting to an antiviral role, which is countered by DENV. IMPORTANCE Autophagic flux is a dynamic process starting with the formation of autophagosomes and ending with their degradation after fusion with lysosomes. Autophagy impacts the replication cycle of many viruses. However, thus far the dynamics of autophagy in case of Dengue virus (DENV) infections has not been systematically quantified. Therefore, we used high-content, imaging-based flow cytometry to quantify autophagic flux and endolysosomal trafficking in response to DENV infection. We report that DENV induced an initial activation of autophagic flux, followed by inhibition of general and specific autophagy. Further, lysosomal activity was increased, but endolysosomal trafficking was suppressed confirming the block of autophagic flux. Importantly, we provide evidence that p62, an autophagy receptor, restrict DENV replication and was specifically depleted in DENV-infected cells via increased proteasomal degradation. These results suggest that during DENV infection autophagy shifts from a proviral to an antiviral cellular process, which is counteracted by the virus.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The findings indicate that in the course of DENV infection, autophagy shifts from a supporting to an antiviral role, which is countered by DENV."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5323,"details":{"paperId":"bf8435f91906136a3f9bdfca7146f15bae180025","externalIds":{"MAG":"2111287018","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.79.9.5414-5420.2005","CorpusId":"22168569","PubMed":"15827155"},"title":"Dengue Virus Inhibits Alpha Interferon Signaling by Reducing STAT2 Expression","abstract":"ABSTRACT Alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) is a key mediator of innate antiviral responses but has little effect on the established replication of dengue viruses, which are mosquito-borne flaviviruses of immense global health importance.

In a recent study analyzing the ability of individual dengue virus-encoded proteins to antagonize the IFN response, nonstructural (NS) protein 4B and possibly NS2A and NS4A were identified as candidate IFN antagonists.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes serious clinical symptoms, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Vascular permeability change is the main feature of the diseases, and the abnormal expression of proinflammatory cytokines is the important cause of vascular permeability change. However, the mechanism underlying vascular permeability induced by DENV has not been fully elucidated. Here, we reveal a distinct mechanism by which DENV infection promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) release to induce endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in mice. DENV M protein interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation, which induce proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β activation and release. Notably, M can induce vascular leakage in mouse tissues by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β. More importantly, inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue injuries are induced by M in wild-type (WT) mouse tissues, but they are not affected by M in NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3−/−) mouse tissues. Evans blue intensities in WT mouse tissues are significantly higher than in NLRP3−/− mouse tissues, demonstrating an essential role of NLRP3 in M-induced vascular leakages in mice. Therefore, we propose that upon DENV infection, M interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion, which lead to the induction of endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in mouse tissues. The important role of the DENV-M-NLRP3-IL-1β axis in the induction of vascular leakage provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying DENV pathogenesis and DENV-associated DHF and DSS development.

DENV infection of primary human endothelial cells (ECs) results in a rapid increase in viral titer, which suggests that DENV inhibits replication-restrictive RIG-I/interferon beta (IFN-β) induction pathways within ECs. Our findings demonstrate that DENV serotype 4 (DENV4) nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2A and NS4B inhibited RIG-I-, MDA5-, MAVS-, and TBK1/IKKε-directed IFN-β transcription (>80%) but failed to inhibit IFN-β induction directed by STING or constitutively active IRF3-5D.

NS2A and NS4B from DENV1/2/4, as well as the West Nile virus NS4B protein, commonly inhibited TBK1 phosphorylation and IFN-β induction. A comparative analysis of NS4A proteins across DENVs demonstrated that DENV1, but not DENV2 or DENV4, NS4A proteins uniquely inhibited TBK1.

Recently, we and others described a novel pathogenic effect of secreted dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in triggering hyperpermeability of human endothelial cells in vitro and systemic vascular leakage in vivo. NS1 was shown to activate toll-like receptor 4 signaling in primary human myeloid cells, leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and vascular leakage. However, distinct endothelial cell-intrinsic mechanisms of NS1-induced hyperpermeability remained to be defined. The endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) is a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins lining the vascular endothelium that plays a key role in regulating endothelial barrier function. Here, we demonstrate that DENV NS1 disrupts the EGL on human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This effect is mediated by NS1-induced expression of sialidases and heparanase, respectively. NS1 also activates cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, in endothelial cells, which activates heparanase via enzymatic cleavage. Specific inhibitors of sialidases, heparanase, and cathepsin L prevent DENV NS1-induced EGL disruption and endothelial hyperpermeability.

Recent estimates indicate that over 390 million people are infected annually with the dengue virus (DENV), resulting in thousands of deaths. Among the DENV nonstructural proteins, the NS1 protein is the only one whose function during replication is still unknown. NS1 is a 46- to 55-kDa glycoprotein commonly found as both a membrane-associated homodimer and a soluble hexameric barrel-shaped lipoprotein. Despite its role in the pathogenic process, NS1 is essential for proper RNA accumulation and virus production. In the present study, we identified that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) interacts with intracellular NS1. Molecular docking revealed that this interaction occurs through the hydrophobic protrusion of NS1 and the hydrophobic residues located at the opposite side of the catalytic site. Moreover, addition of purified recombinant NS1 enhanced the glycolytic activity of GAPDH in vitro. Interestingly, we observed that DENV infection promoted the relocalization of GAPDH to the perinuclear region, where NS1 is commonly found. Both DENV infection and expression of NS1 itself resulted in increased GAPDH activity. Our findings indicate that the NS1 protein acts to increase glycolytic flux and, consequently, energy production, which is consistent with the recent finding that DENV induces and requires glycolysis for proper replication. This is the first report to propose that NS1 is an important modulator of cellular energy metabolism. The data presented here provide new insights that may be useful for further drug design and the development of alternative antiviral therapies against DENV. IMPORTANCE Dengue represents a serious public health problem worldwide and is caused by infection with dengue virus (DENV). Estimates indicate that half of the global population is at risk of infection, with almost 400 million cases occurring per year. The NS1 glycoprotein is found in both the intracellular and the extracellular milieus. Despite the fact that NS1 has been commonly associated with DENV pathogenesis, it plays a pivotal but unknown role in the replication process. In an effort to understand the role of intracellular NS1, we demonstrate that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) interacts with NS1. Our results indicate that NS1 increases the glycolytic activity of GAPDH in vitro.

The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional glycoprotein necessary for viral replication. ABSTRACT The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein that forms part of replication complexes. NS1 is also secreted, as a hexamer, to the extracellular milieu. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several mechanisms. Cell binding and internalization of soluble NS1 result in endothelial hyperpermeability and in the downregulation of the innate immune response. In this work, we report that the HDL scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) in human hepatic cells and a scavenger receptor B1-like in mosquito C6/36 cells act as cell surface binding receptors for dengue virus NS1. The presence of the SRB1 on the plasma membrane of C6/36 cells, as well as in Huh7 cells, was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. The internalization of NS1 can be efficiently blocked by anti-SRB1 antibodies, and previous incubation of the cells with HDL significantly reduces NS1 internalization. Significant reduction in NS1 internalization was observed in C6/36 cells transfected with siRNAs specific for SRB1. In addition, the transient expression of SRB1 in Vero cells, which lacks the receptor, allows NS1 internalization in these cells. Direct interaction between soluble NS1 and the SRB1 in Huh7 and C6/36 cells was demonstrated in situ by proximity ligation assays and in vitro by surface plasmon resonance. Finally, results are presented indicating that the SRB1 also acts as a cell receptor for Zika virus NS1. These results demonstrate that dengue virus NS1, a bona fide lipoprotein, usurps the HDL receptor for cell entry and offers explanations for the altered serum lipoprotein homeostasis observed in dengue patients.

NS1 is also secreted as a hexameric lipoprotein and circulates in high concentrations in the sera of patients. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several mechanisms, including favoring of virus replication in hepatocytes and dendritic cells and disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx leading to hyperpermeability. Those last actions require NS1 internalization. Here, we identify the scavenger cell receptor B1, as the cell-binding receptor for dengue and Zika virus NS1, in cultured liver and in mosquito cells.

Here, we show that biogenic amines production and uptake impede DV replication in hepatocytes and monocytes, while the virus reduces catecholamine biosynthesis, metabolism, and transport. To examine how catecholamine biosynthesis/metabolism influences DV, first, we verified the role of DDC by altering DDC expression. DDC silencing enhanced virus replication, but not translation, attenuated the negative effect of DDC substrates on the virus and reduced the infection related cell death. Then, the role of the downstream steps of the catecholamine biosynthesis/metabolism was analyzed by chemical inhibition of the respective enzymes, application of their substrates and/or their products; moreover, reserpine, the inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), was used to examine the role of uptake/storage of catecholamines on DV. Apart from the role of each enzyme/transporter, these studies revealed that the dopamine uptake, and not the dopamine-signaling, is responsible for the negative effect on DV. Accordingly, all treatments expected to enhance the accumulation of catecholamines in the cell cytosol suppressed DV replication. This was verified by the use of chemical inducers of catecholamine biosynthesis.

Here, we combined cell fractionation, ribosome profiling, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the subcellular organization of viral genome translation and replication as well as host cell translation and its response to DENV infection. We report that throughout the viral life cycle, DENV plus- and minus-strand RNAs were highly partitioned to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), identifying the ER as the primary site of DENV translation. DENV infection was accompanied by an ER compartment-specific remodeling of translation, where ER translation capacity was subverted from host transcripts to DENV plus-strand RNA, particularly at late stages of infection. Remarkably, translation levels and patterns in the cytosol compartment were only modestly affected throughout the experimental time course of infection. Comparisons of ribosome footprinting densities of the DENV plus-strand RNA and host mRNAs indicated that DENV plus-strand RNA was only sparsely loaded with ribosomes. Combined, these observations suggest a mechanism where ER-localized translation and translational control mechanisms, likely cis encoded, are used to repurpose the ER for DENV virion production. Consistent with this view, we found ER-linked cellular stress response pathways commonly associated with viral infection, namely, the interferon response and unfolded protein response, to be only modestly activated during DENV infection. These data support a model where DENV reprograms the ER protein synthesis and processing environment to promote viral survival and replication while minimizing the activation of antiviral and proteostatic stress response pathways. IMPORTANCE DENV, a prominent human health threat with no broadly effective or specific treatment, depends on host cell translation machinery for viral replication, immune evasion, and virion biogenesis. The molecular mechanism by which DENV commandeers the host cell protein synthesis machinery and the subcellular organization of DENV replication and viral protein synthesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that DENV has an almost exclusively ER-localized life cycle, with viral replication and translation largely restricted to the ER. Surprisingly, DENV infection largely affects only ER-associated translation, with relatively modest effects on host cell translation in the cytosol. DENV RNA translation is very inefficient, likely representing a strategy to minimize disruption of ER proteostasis. Overall these findings demonstrate that DENV has evolved an ER-compartmentalized life cycle; thus, targeting the molecular signatures and regulation of the DENV-ER interaction landscape may reveal strategies for therapeutic intervention.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"DENV has an almost exclusively ER-localized life cycle, with viral replication and translation largely restricted to the ER, with relatively modest effects on host cell translation in the cytosol."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5255,"details":{"paperId":"e9cce4ab364390ea38d072e89a95492d92daabf1","externalIds":{"MAG":"2140031202","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.76.16.8408-8419.2002","CorpusId":"15179859","PubMed":"12134044"},"title":"Dengue Virus Selectively Induces Human Mast Cell Chemokine Production","abstract":"ABSTRACT Severe dengue virus infections usually occur in individuals who have preexisting anti-dengue virus antibodies.

We determined that DENV NS4A interacts with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which was previously found to activate NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thus inducing type I IFN in the mitochondrion-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs).

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that infects upward of 300 million people annually and has the potential to cause fatal hemorrhagic fever and shock. While the parameters contributing to dengue immunopathogenesis remain unclear, the collapse of redox homeostasis and the damage induced by oxidative stress have been correlated with the development of inflammation and progression toward the more severe forms of disease. In the present study, we demonstrate that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) late after DENV infection (>24 hpi) resulted from a disruption in the balance between oxidative stress and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response. The DENV NS2B3 protease complex strategically targeted Nrf2 for degradation in a proteolysis-independent manner; NS2B3 licensed Nrf2 for lysosomal degradation. Impairment of the Nrf2 regulator by the NS2B3 complex inhibited the antioxidant gene network and contributed to the progressive increase in ROS levels, along with increased virus replication and inflammatory or apoptotic gene expression. By 24 hpi, when increased levels of ROS and antiviral proteins were observed, it appeared that the proviral effect of ROS overcame the antiviral effects of the interferon (IFN) response. Overall, these studies demonstrate that DENV infection disrupts the regulatory interplay between DENV-induced stress responses, Nrf2 antioxidant signaling, and the host antiviral immune response, thus exacerbating oxidative stress and inflammation in DENV infection.

Using an optimized humanized mouse model, we show that human NK cells, through the secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), are critical in the early defense against DENV infection. Depletion of NK cells or neutralization of IFN-γ leads to increased viremia and more severe thrombocytopenia and liver damage in humanized mice. In vitro studies using autologous human NK cells show that DENV-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), but not monocytes, activate NK cells in a contact-dependent manner, resulting in upregulation of CD69 and CD25 and secretion of IFN-γ. Blocking adhesion molecules (LFA-1, DNAM-1, CD2, and 2β4) on NK cells abolishes NK cell activation, IFN-γ secretion, and the control of DENV replication. NK cells activated by infected MDDCs also inhibit DENV infection in monocytes. These findings show the essential role of human NK cells in protection against acute DENV infection in vivo, identify adhesion molecules and dendritic cells required for NK cell activation, and delineate the sequence of events for NK cell activation and protection against DENV infection.

The diverse disease manifestation is thought to result from a complex interplay between viral and host factors.

Type I and type II interferons of the innate immune system demonstrate non-overlapping roles in dengue infection. Furthermore, while some IFN responses to dengue are protective, others may exert disease-related effects on the host. But aside from interferons, a number of cytokines have also been implicated in dengue pathogenesis. Our expanding knowledge of cytokines indicates that these soluble mediators act upon a complicated network of events to provoke the disease. This cytokine storm is generally attributed to massive T cell activation as an outcome of secondary infection. However, there is reason to believe that innate immune response-derived cytokines also have contributory effects, especially in the context of severe cases of primary dengue infection. Another less popular but interesting perspective on dengue pathogenesis is the effect of mosquito feeding on host immune responses and viral infection. Various studies have shown that soluble factors from vector saliva have the capacity to alter immune reactions and thereby influence pathogen transmission and establishment. Hence, modulation of the innate immune system at various levels of infection is a critical component of dengue disease.

Dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus, is the leading cause of serious arthropod-borne disease globally. The genomes of DENV, like the genomes of yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile fever virus (WNV), or Zika virus (ZIKV), control their translation by a 5′-terminal capping group. Three other genera of Flaviviridae are remarkable because their viruses use internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) to control translation, and they are not arthropod transmitted. In 2006, E. Harris’ group published work suggesting that DENV RNA does not stringently need a cap for translation. They proposed that instead DENV translation is controlled by an interplay between 5′ and 3′ termini. Here we present evidence that the DENV or ZIKV 5′ untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) alone have IRES competence. This conclusion is based, first, on the observation that uncapped monocistronic mRNAs 5′ terminated with the DENV or ZIKV 5′-UTRs can efficiently direct translation of a reporter gene in BHK and C6/36 cells and second, that either 5′-UTR placed between two reporter genes can efficiently induce expression of the downstream gene in BHK cells but not in C6/36 cells. These experiments followed observations that uncapped DENV/ZIKV genomic transcripts, 5′ terminated with pppAN… or GpppAN…, can initiate infections of mammalian (BHK) or mosquito (C6/36) cells.

Here, we aimed to explore the importance of peroxisomes and the role of C interaction with PEX19 in the flavivirus life cycle. By infecting cells lacking peroxisomes we show that this organelle is required for optimal DENV replication. Moreover, we demonstrate that DENV and ZIKV C bind PEX19 through a conserved PEX19-binding motif, which is also commonly found in cellular peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs).

Flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), utilize the ER as a source of membranes to establish their replication organelles and to facilitate their assembly and eventual maturation along the secretory pathway. To maintain normal homeostasis, host cells have evolved highly efficient processes to dynamically regulate the ER, such as through reticulophagy, a selective form of autophagy that leads to ER degradation. Here, we identify the ER-localized reticulophagy receptor FAM134B as a host cell restriction factor for both DENV and ZIKV. We show that RNAi-mediated depletion of FAM134B significantly enhances both DENV and ZIKV replication at an early stage of the viral life cycle. Consistent with its role as an antiviral host factor, we found that several flaviviruses including DENV, ZIKV, and West Nile virus (WNV), utilize their NS3 virally-encoded proteases to directly cleave FAM134B at a single site within its reticulon homology domain (RHD). Mechanistically, we show that NS3-mediated cleavage of FAM134B blocks the formation of ER and viral protein-enriched autophagosomes, suggesting that the cleavage of FAM134B serves to specifically suppress the reticulophagy pathway.

These cell lines offer alternative approaches to investigating the interactions between arboviruses and other vertebrates at the cellular level. The various cell origins, types, and morphologies can be valuable resources for studying viral ecology and examining hypotheses regarding viral reservoirs. Dengue viruses (DENV) are major re-emerging pathogens that have been studied classically in only a few cell lines. Methods: We evaluated the susceptibility of 19 distinct mammalian, avian, and reptilian cell lines to DENV infection. Cell lines were infected with DENV serotypes 1–4 and evaluated for susceptibility via focus-forming unit assays and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Both methods demonstrated the ability of DENV to replicate in 14 cell lines derived from various vertebrates with viral titers ranging from 1 × 10 to 1 × 10 infectious units per milliliter. Cell line susceptibility to DENV infection was serotype specific, with DENV-1 and DENV-4 infecting more cell lines than either DENV-2 or DENV-3. Cellular type also seemed to affect the infectivity of DENV. Human endothelial cells were only susceptible to DENV-4. Of six fibroblast lines, 100% were susceptible to at least one DENV serotype whereas only 62% of 13 epithelial lines were susceptible to DENV serotypes 1–4. Conclusion: These data indicate that a variety of cell lines from human and animal species can be used to culture DENV. The serotype-specific susceptibility for certain cell lines may provide a tool to help characterize specific DENV serotypes as well as an in vitro platform for the study of host–pathogen interactions and the co-circulation of DENV serotypes in a specific region or individual.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data indicate that a variety of cell lines from human and animal species can be used to culture DENV, and the serotype-specific susceptibility for certain cell lines may provide a tool to help characterize specific DENV serotypes as well as an in vitro platform for the study of host–pathogen interactions and the co-circulation of DENVserotypes in a specific region or individual."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":3397,"details":{"paperId":"8f24952a2e95b187ffc6730f647f8a9fc756db16","externalIds":{"MAG":"2000001441","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1304300110","CorpusId":"42252928","PubMed":"23569243"},"title":"Dengue structure differs at the temperatures of its human and mosquito hosts","abstract":"We report on a conformational transition of dengue virus when changing the temperature from that present in its mosquito vectors to that of its human host.

Manokaran et al. examined one example, the emergence of a new clade of dengue virus (DENV) that caused an outbreak in Puerto Rico in 1994. The epidemic strain produced elevated amounts of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a viral noncoding RNA, relative to amounts of genomic viral RNA. sfRNA bound to and inhibited TRIM25, a protein important for activating the host's antiviral response, and so by reducing host immunity was able to increase its own fitness.

Identification of viral determinants of transmission can help identify isolates with high epidemiological potential. Additionally, mechanistic understanding of transmission will lead to better understanding of how dengue viruses harness evolution to cycle between the two hosts. Here, we identified viral determinants of transmission and characterized mechanisms that enhance production of infectious saliva by inhibiting immunity specifically in salivary glands. Combining oral infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and reverse genetics, we identified two 3’ UTR substitutions in epidemic isolates that increased subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) quantity, infectious particles in salivary glands and infection rate of saliva, which represents a measure of transmission. We also demonstrated that various 3’UTR modifications similarly affect sfRNA quantity in both whole mosquitoes and human cells, suggesting a shared determinism of sfRNA quantity. Furthermore, higher relative quantity of sfRNA in salivary glands compared to midgut and carcass pointed to sfRNA function in salivary glands. We showed that the Toll innate immune response was preferentially inhibited in salivary glands by viruses with the 3’UTR substitutions associated to high epidemiological fitness and high sfRNA quantity, pointing to a mechanism for higher saliva infection rate.

This was addressed by using a series of enhanced green fluorescent protein-fused DEN proteins. Evidence is provided that intracellular production of the M ectodomains (residues M-1 to M-40) of all four DEN serotypes triggered apoptosis in host cells such as mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2a and human hepatoma HepG2 cells.

The export of the M ectodomain from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane appeared to be essential for the initiation of apoptosis. The study found that anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 protected HepG2 cells against the death-promoting activity of the DEN M ectodomain.

A leak in the dike Everyone knows how mosquitos can wreck an end-of-summer picnic. But in some climates, these pesky intruders persist and carry a variety of detrimental diseases—some with no preventative vaccines or targeted therapies. One such passenger is dengue virus (DENV), which infects up to 400 million people each year and comes in several serotypes (1 to 4) and disease presentations—from mild infection to severe disease and sometimes death. But to treat or prevent dengue requires that we have a more complete picture of the disease pathology. Now, Modhiran et al. and Beatty et al. describe the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments that point to circulating dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and the innate immune Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a focus for basic scientists as well as vaccine and drug developers. DENV infection protects a patient from future reinfection with the same DENV serotype as well as producing temporary immune protection from severe dengue disease caused by a different DENV serotype. But unlike diamonds, this immune protection doesn’t last forever, and when the protected period passes, the patient becomes at increased risk of enhanced infection and progression to severe disease if he or she is infected with a second DENV serotype. This severe form of dengue infection is believed to result from immunopathogenic processes that induce cytokine storm and cause vascular leakage that leads to shock. Until now, no dengue viral proteins have been linked to vascular endothelium permeability (that is, vascular leakage). Beatty et al. show that inoculation of mice with DENV NS1 protein alone induces both vascular leak and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and that administration of NS1 with a sublethal dose of DENV2 leads to lethal vascular leak syndrome. In human endothelial cell monolayers in culture, NS1 from any of the four DENV serotypes triggered endothelial barrier permeability. NS1’s pathogenic effects were blocked by NS1-immune polyclonal mouse serum or monoclonal antibodies to NS1 (in vivo and in vitro), and immunization of mice with NS1 protected against lethal DENV2 challenge. In an independent study, Mondrian et al. explore the underlying mechanism of NS1’s effects. They show that highly purified NS1 acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that activates mouse macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in culture via TLR4, resulting in release of inflammatory cytokines—an effect that was blocked by either a TLR4 antagonist or an anti-TLR4 antibody. Then, in an in vitro model of vascular leak, the authors found that NS1 fractured the integrity of endothelial cell monolayers through a TLR4-dependent pathway, a finding that was supported by the observation that a TLR4 antagonist quelled capillary leak in a mouse model of dengue virus infection. Together, these new findings highlight NS1 as an instigator of dengue-associated vascular leak and thus pinpoint a potential target for dengue drugs and component for dengue vaccines. Complications arising from dengue virus infection include potentially fatal vascular leak, and severe disease has been linked with excessive immune cell activation. An understanding of the triggers of this activation is critical for the development of appropriately targeted disease control strategies. We show here that the secreted form of the dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Highly purified NS1 devoid of bacterial endotoxin activity directly activated mouse macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to the induction and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In an in vitro model of vascular leak, treatment with NS1 alone resulted in the disruption of endothelial cell monolayer integrity. Both NS1-mediated activation of PBMCs and NS1-induced vascular leak in vitro were inhibited by a TLR4 antagonist and by anti-TLR4 antibody treatment. The importance of TLR4 activation in vivo was confirmed by the reduction in capillary leak by a TLR4 antagonist in a mouse model of dengue virus infection. These results pinpoint NS1 as a viral toxin counterpart of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similar to the role of LPS in septic shock, NS1 might contribute to vascular leak in dengue patients, which highlights TLR4 antagonists as a possible therapeutic option.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that the secreted form of the dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that activates mouse macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in culture via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), resulting in release of inflammatory cytokines—an effect that was blocked by either a TLR4 antagonist or an anti-TLR 4 antibody."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2995,"details":{"paperId":"8126e730879a843c7da803069601fa9218061951","externalIds":{"MAG":"2591554718","DOI":"10.1038/icb.2017.5","CorpusId":"3842035","PubMed":"28220810"},"title":"Dengue virus NS1 protein activates immune cells via TLR4 but not TLR2 or TLR6","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"RLR4 remains a therapeutic target for DENV infections, with TLR4 antagonists holding promise for the treatment of dengue disease, and recombinant NS1, expressed and purified from eukaryotic cells, induces cytokine production viaTLR4 but not TLR2/6."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6763,"details":{"paperId":"7ec469a873a355e0c39e436de4a10da8cdab40f2","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.15252/embr.202153600","CorpusId":"249014382","PubMed":"35607830"},"title":"Dengue virus NS1 protein conveys pro‐inflammatory signals by docking onto high‐density lipoproteins","abstract":"The dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a secreted virulence factor that modulates complement, activates immune cells and alters endothelial barriers.

As a probable initiating event, direct purified DENV-platelet binding was followed in the current study by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and confirmed antigenically. Approximately 800 viruses specifically bound per platelet at 37°C. Fewer sites were observed at 25°C, the blood bank storage temperature (∼350 sites), or 4°C, known to attenuate virus cell entry (∼200 sites).

In addition to carrying the main antigenic determinants of the virus, these proteins are responsible for the major steps involved in the entry process, which involve receptor recognition and fusion between viral and cellular membranes. A huge step forward in the field was made >20 years ago, when the laboratories of Don Wiley and John Skehel obtained the crystal structure of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) (1), which carries both receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. Since then, the x-ray structures of relatively few soluble ectodomains of viral glycoproteins have been determined, compared to the exponential increase of protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank in the same period. In particular, structural information on viral envelope proteins combining both receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions is very scarce. Over the years, only the structures of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) flavivirus major envelope (E) protein (2) and of the influenza C virus HA-esterase glycoprotein (3) were added to the database. In this issue of PNAS, Modis et al. (4) report the crystal structure of the E protein from dengue virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for the highest rate of disease and mortality among members of this viral genus. This structure is therefore a very important addition to the current repertoire.\n\nDengue virus is the most important arthropod-borne human pathogen.

This host alternation imposes a selective pressure on the viral population. Here, we found that dengue virus, the most important viral human pathogen transmitted by insects, evolved a mechanism to differentially regulate the production of viral non-coding RNAs in mosquitos and humans, with a significant impact on viral fitness in each host. Flavivirus infections accumulate non-coding RNAs derived from the viral 3’UTRs (known as sfRNAs), relevant in viral pathogenesis and immune evasion. We found that dengue virus host adaptation leads to the accumulation of different species of sfRNAs in vertebrate and invertebrate cells. This process does not depend on differences in the host machinery; but it was found to be dependent on the selection of specific mutations in the viral 3’UTR. Dissecting the viral population and studying phenotypes of cloned variants, the molecular determinants for the switch in the sfRNA pattern during host change were mapped to a single RNA structure. Point mutations selected in mosquito cells were sufficient to change the pattern of sfRNAs, induce higher type I interferon responses and reduce viral fitness in human cells, explaining the rapid clearance of certain viral variants after host change. In addition, using epidemic and pre-epidemic Zika viruses, similar patterns of sfRNAs were observed in mosquito and human infected cells, but they were different from those observed during dengue virus infections, indicating that distinct selective pressures act on the 3’UTR of these closely related viruses. In summary, we present a novel mechanism by which dengue virus evolved an RNA structure that is under strong selective pressure in the two hosts, as regulator of non-coding RNA accumulation and viral fitness.

Thrombocytopenia is a major characteristic observed in both mild and severe dengue disease and is significantly correlated with the progression of dengue severity. Previous studies have shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which can be secreted into patients’ blood, can stimulate immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and can cause endothelial leakage. However, it is unclear whether DENV NS1 can directly induce platelet activation or cause thrombocytopenia during DENV infection. In this study, we first demonstrated that DENV but not Zika virus cell culture supernatant could induce P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in human platelets, both of which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Similar results were found using recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV, and those effects were blocked in the presence of anti-NS1 F(ab’)2, anti-TLR4 antibody, a TLR4 antagonist (Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide, LPS-Rs) and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor (TAK242), but not polymyxin B (an LPS inhibitor). Moreover, the activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Finally, we demonstrated that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant.

This approach identified three cellular pathways required for DENV replication: autophagy, actin polymerization, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Further characterization of the viral modulation of fatty acid biosynthesis revealed that a key enzyme in this pathway, fatty acid synthase (FASN), is relocalized to sites of DENV replication. DENV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is responsible for FASN recruitment, inasmuch as (i) NS3 expressed in the absence of other viral proteins colocalizes with FASN and (ii) NS3 interacts with FASN in a two-hybrid assay.

DENV is an envelope virus that relies on host lipid membranes for its life-cycle. Here, we characterized how DENV hijacks the mosquito lipidome to identify targets for novel transmission-blocking interventions. To describe metabolic changes throughout the mosquito DENV cycle, we deployed a Liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) workflow including spectral similarity annotation in cells, midguts and whole mosquitoes at different times post infection. We revealed a major aminophospholipid reconfiguration with an overall early increase, followed by a reduction later in the cycle. We phylogenetically characterized acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) enzyme isoforms to identify those that catalyze a rate-limiting step in phospholipid biogenesis, the acylation of lysophosphatidate to phosphatidate. We showed that DENV infection decreased AGPAT1, but did not alter AGPAT2 expression in cells, midguts and mosquitoes. Depletion of either AGPAT1 or AGPAT2 increased aminophospholipids and partially recapitulated DENV-induced reconfiguration before infection in vitro. However, only AGPAT1 depletion promoted infection by maintaining high aminophospholipid concentrations. In mosquitoes, AGPAT1 depletion also partially recapitulated DENV-induced aminophospholipid increase before infection and enhanced infection by maintaining high aminophospholipid concentrations.

In ~2 million of these individuals, the disease may progress into life‐threatening haemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. Approximately 200 million high‐titre infections remain asymptomatic and are a documented risk for transfusion transmission. Interestingly, both mild and severe DENV infections result in thrombocytopenia. Well‐established DENV receptors studies have suggested that similar receptors on platelets may facilitate comparable binding. To help explain DENV‐mediated platelet pathology, indirect evidence for a DENV‐platelet interaction with possible cell entry and direct binding has been reported. Increasing evidence has established that platelets contain the necessary translational machinery to generate protein from RNA. Since DENV has an RNA genome, we hypothesized that platelets are permissive to DENV replication. Using highly purified DENV and platelets, a specific dendritic cell‐specific intercellular adhesin molecule‐3‐grabbing non‐integrin/heparan proteoglycan coreceptor binding system was identified. Demonstrating de novo virus protein and genome generation and production of infectious progeny by viable platelets now adds to the understanding of DENV‐associated thrombocytopenia. Of importance to global blood systems, donor‐derived platelet concentrates (PCs) and red‐blood‐cells units (RBCs) also replicated viral RNA. In each case, DENV underwent spontaneous logarithmic decay which was offset by the production of new virus progeny.

Here we describe the role of the CC‐chemokine receptor CCR5 in Dengue virus (DENV‐2) infection. In vitro experiments showed that CCR5 is a host factor required for DENV‐2 replication in human and mouse macrophages. DENV‐2 infection induces the expression of CCR5 ligands. Incubation with an antagonist prevents CCR5 activation and reduces DENV‐2 positive‐stranded (+) RNA inside macrophages. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of DENV‐2 infection we found that CCR5−/− mice were resistant to lethal infection, presenting at least 100‐fold reduction of viral load in target organs and significant reduction in disease severity. This phenotype was reproduced in wild‐type mice treated with CCR5‐blocking compounds. Therefore, CCR5 is a host factor required for DENV‐2 replication and disease development.

This mosquito-borne Flavivirus causes mild to severe dengue fever which in some cases leads to life-threatening conditions namely, dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Annual infection is estimated at 390 million globally with 96 million manifesting clinically. So, ≥80% infections are asymptomatic and self-limiting. Dengue virus (DV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a proven virotoxin abundantly present in the victim’s blood. We found that DV-infected or only NS1-expressing cells both can induce Cleaved Caspase3, due to antiviral response of host cells. NS1-transfected cells also showed nuclear damage and significant levels of DNA breaks suggestive of ensuing apoptosis. So, it was established that NS1 alone is capable of causing apoptosis. Surprisingly, despite secreting similar amount of soluble NS1, the DV-infected cells showed intact nuclear morphology and background levels of DNA nicks. These observations suggested that DV downregulates apoptosis of infected cells, which is a viral strategy against host defence. Furthermore, DV-infected cells counteracted Camptothecin-induced apoptotic DNA break. DV-infection was also found to keep the infected cells metabolically more active than only NS1 expressing cells. So, DV bypasses cellular defence against virus i.e. apoptosis by counteracting cellular DNA break and keeps the infected cells metabolically active to support virus replication for longer period which eventually results in high virus titer in circulation. Our findings reveal another level of intricacy involving dengue virus-host interactions and perhaps explain why ≥80% DV infections are asymptomatic/self-limiting despite the presence of NS1 virotoxin in infected cells. Author Summary NS1, a virotoxin, abundantly present in Dengue patients blood, is a major player behind disease patho-biogenesis including plasma leakage. Despite the presence of NS1 in blood, Dengue is asymptomatic and self-limiting in more than 80% dengue virus (DV) infected people. We investigated this observation and found that plasmid-mediated NS1 expression and secretion in cells are sufficient to cause programmed cell death (apoptosis) and associated cellular DNA breakage. However, cells infected with dengue virus and secreting equivalent amounts of NS1 didn’t exhibit apoptotic DNA breakage. Consequently, DV-infected cells showed better survival than cells in which only NS1 was transiently expressed by transfection with expression plasmid. We also found that DV can even prevent chemical induced apoptotic DNA damage in infected host cells.

The transcript of the SAT1 gene, of well-known antiviral action, displayed higher inclusion of exon 4 in infected cells, leading to an mRNA isoform that is degraded by non-sense mediated decay. SAT1 is a spermidine/spermine acetyl-transferase enzyme that decreases the reservoir of cellular polyamines, limiting viral replication. Delving into the molecular mechanism underlying SAT1 pre-mRNA splicing changes upon viral infection, we observed lower protein levels of RBM10, a splicing factor responsible for SAT1 exon 4 skipping. We found that the dengue polymerase NS5 interacts with RBM10 and its sole expression triggers RBM10 proteasome-mediated degradation. RBM10 over-expression in infected cells prevents SAT1 splicing changes and limits viral replication, while its knock-down enhances the splicing switch and also benefits viral replication, revealing an anti-viral role for RBM10. Consistently, RBM10 depletion attenuates expression of interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In particular, we found that RBM10 interacts with viral RNA and RIG-I, and even promotes the ubiquitination of the latter, a crucial step for its activation.

Recent work has indicated that DENV affinity for cell lines is serotype-specific, which raises challenging questions regarding DENV-host interactions as well as the development of therapeutics and control programs. Methods: We evaluated the infectious capacity of 11 strains of DENV for serotypes 1–4 in 17 distinct cell lines. The cell lines were evaluated for virus susceptibility via immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Both methods demonstrated the ability of DENV to replicate in all cell lines, with viral titers ranging from 1 × 10 to 1 × 10 infectious units per mL. Cell line susceptibility to DENV infection was strain-specific, with DENV-4 strains infecting more cell lines than the other serotypes. DENV-2 New Guinea C and DENV-4 H241 were detected in more cell lines than any other strains. Viral fusion assays indicated that DENV requirements for fusion are strain-specific. Conclusion: These data indicate that several cell lines can be used to culture and study DENV. The strain-specific susceptibility for certain cell lines may provide a tool for characterizing specific DENV strains and an in vitro platform for the development and optimization of therapeutics, the study of host-pathogen interactions, and ecological studies on the cocirculation of DENV strains in a specific region or individual.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The strain-specific susceptibility for certain cell lines may provide a tool for characterizing specificDENV strains and an in vitro platform for the development and optimization of therapeutics, the study of host-pathogen interactions, and ecological studies on the cocirculation of DENV strains in a specific region or individual."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":84,"details":{"paperId":"058914fc47eaf69409ad70c552218ee630198871","externalIds":{"MAG":"3043359846","DOI":"10.1002/JLB.4MA0620-658R","CorpusId":"220528046","PubMed":"32663907"},"title":"Dengue virus‐activated platelets modulate monocyte immunometabolic response through lipid droplet biogenesis and cytokine signaling","abstract":"Dengue is characterized as one of the most important arthropod‐borne human viral diseases, representing a public health problem.

Recently, our group demonstrated the contribution of platelet–monocyte interaction to inflammatory responses in dengue, adding to evolving evidence that platelets have inflammatory functions and can regulate different aspects of innate immune responses. Furthermore, stimuli‐specific‐activated platelets can promote phenotypic changes and metabolic reprogramming in monocytes. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the roles of dengue virus (DENV)‐activated platelets on immunometabolic reprogramming of monocytes in vitro, focusing on lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis. We demonstrated that platelets exposed to DENV in vitro form aggregates with monocytes and signal to LD formation and CXCL8/IL‐8, IL‐10, CCL2, and PGE2 secretion. Pharmacologic inhibition of LD biogenesis prevents PGE2 secretion, but not CXCL8/IL‐8 release, by platelet–monocyte complexes. In exploring the mechanisms involved, we demonstrated that LD formation in monocytes exposed to DENV‐activated platelets is partially dependent on platelet‐produced MIF. Additionally, LD formation is higher in monocytes, which have platelets adhered on their surface, suggesting that beyond paracrine signaling, platelet adhesion is an important event in platelet‐mediated modulation of lipid metabolism in monocytes.

Vector control methods to contain transmission have not been successful and there is currently no useful diagnostic test, drug or vaccine to combat dengue disease. However, as a result of the heightened awareness of its magnitude and its potential to spread beyond the tropical world, dengue has begun to emerge out of the list of neglected diseases in recent years. New interest in this disease has drawn scientists from multiple disciplines into the dengue arena. This has resulted in novel insights into several aspects of dengue virus biology and identified potential drug targets. Several tetravalent vaccines are being developed. Newer animal models that mirror some of the salient features of dengue disease are becoming available to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis and to aid in drug and vaccine discovery efforts. The realization that therapeutic and prophylactic intervention can be cost-effective has resulted in vigorous industry-driven translational initiatives to develop drugs and vaccines.

The dengue viruses (DENV) are members of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, which means they need an insect as a host to complete their life cycle. The full life cycle of dengue fever virus evolves the role of mosquito as a transmitter and human as the main victim and source of infection [2]. When a mosquito bites a person who has DENV in his or her blood, the mosquito becomes infected with the DENV. An infected mosquito can later transmit that virus to healthy people by biting them. This dengue disease is rapidly spreading in all regions of WHO in recent years. Recently, one dengue vaccine was licensed, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), developed by Sanofi Pasteur (http://www.who.int/immunization/research/development/dengue_q_and_a/en/). But it is only applicable for use in individuals 9–45 years of age, and the vaccine is currently not prequalified. Therefore, intensive efforts to develop a vaccine to protect against dengue are still ongoing. It is primarily transmitted by 1 mosquito species, Aedes aegypti. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. After virus incubation for 4–10 days, an infected mosquito is able to transmit the virus for the rest of its life. In 1943, Ren Kimura and Susumu Hotta first quarantined the DENV [3]. These 2 scientists were studying blood samples of patients taken during the 1943 dengue epidemic in Nagasaki, Japan. One year later, Albert B. Sabin and Walter Schlesinger independently isolated the DENV [4]. The DENV genome is a single strand of RNA. It is referred to as positive-sense RNA because it can be directly translated into proteins. The viral genome encodes 10 proteins, as shown in Fig 1. Three are structural proteins, which are the capsid (C), the precursor of membrane protein (PrM/M), and the envelope protein (E), while the rest are nonstructural (NS) proteins:NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. These NS proteins play roles in viral replication and assembly. Because the dengue genome encodes only 10 viral proteins, the virus needs to hijack host proteins to help its replication. An understanding of how viruses interact with host cellular machineries to survive and replicate is important for the development of drugs. One way that viruses interact with their hosts is by protein–protein interactions (PPI). Therefore, indentifying PPI between DENV and host proteins will increase understanding of the function of virus proteins and how they reproduce and cause disease.

The etiology of dengue-associated thrombocytopenia is multifactorial and includes increased platelet clearance. The binding of the coagulation protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet membrane and removal of sialic acid (desialylation) are two well-known mechanisms of platelet clearance, but whether these conditions also contribute to thrombocytopenia in dengue infection is unknown. In two observational cohort studies in Bandung and Jepara, Indonesia, we show that adult patients with dengue not only had higher plasma concentrations of plasma VWF antigen and active VWF, but that circulating platelets had also bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Furthermore, sialic acid levels in dengue patients were significantly reduced as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. Sialic acid on the platelet membrane is neuraminidase-labile, but dengue virus has no known neuraminidase activity. Indeed, no detectable activity of neuraminidase was present in plasma of dengue patients and no desialylation was found of plasma transferrin. Platelet sialylation was also not altered by in vitro exposure of platelets to DENV nonstructural protein 1 or cultured DENV. In contrast, induction of binding of VWF to glycoprotein 1b on platelets using the VWF-activating protein ristocetin resulted in the removal of platelet sialic acid by translocation of platelet neuraminidase to the platelet surface. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. Our data demonstrate that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in dengue results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance.

There are no approved therapies to treat DENV infection, and the only available vaccine shows limited efficacy. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) constitutes one of the most important arboviral pathogens affecting humans. The high prevalence of DENV infections, which cause more than 20,000 deaths annually, and the lack of effective vaccines or direct-acting antiviral drugs make it a global health concern. DENV genome replication occurs in close association with the host endomembrane system, which is remodeled to form the viral replication organelle that originates from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. To date, the viral and cellular determinants responsible for the biogenesis of DENV replication organelles are still poorly defined. The viral nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) can remodel membranes and has been shown to associate with numerous host factors in DENV-replicating cells. In the present study, we used reverse and forward genetic screens and identified sites within NS4A required for DENV replication. We also mapped the determinants in NS4A required for interactions with other viral proteins. Moreover, taking advantage of our recently developed polyprotein expression system, we evaluated the role of NS4A in the formation of DENV replication organelles. Together, we report a detailed map of determinants within NS4A required for RNA replication, interaction with other viral proteins, and replication organelle formation. Our results suggest that NS4A might be an attractive target for antiviral therapy. IMPORTANCE DENV is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus, causing around 390 million infections each year. There are no approved therapies to treat DENV infection, and the only available vaccine shows limited efficacy. The viral nonstructural proteins have emerged as attractive drug targets due to their pivotal role in RNA replication and establishment of virus-induced membranous compartments, designated replication organelles (ROs). The transmembrane protein NS4A, generated by cleavage of the NS4A-2K-4B precursor, contributes to DENV replication by unknown mechanisms. Here, we report a detailed genetic interaction map of NS4A and identify residues required for RNA replication and interaction between NS4A-2K-4B and NS2B-3 as well as NS1. Importantly, by means of an expression-based system, we demonstrate the essential role of NS4A in RO biogenesis and identify determinants in NS4A required for this process. Our data suggest that NS4A is an attractive target for antiviral therapy.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A detailed map of determinants within NS4A required for RNA replication, interaction with other viral proteins, and replication organelle formation is reported and suggests that NS4 a might be an attractive target for antiviral therapy."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":274,"details":{"paperId":"bfe1b203f083bf84a87275e95a18a3112b34f7ba","externalIds":{"MAG":"2045742755","DOI":"10.1006/VIRO.2000.0457","CorpusId":"31509371","PubMed":"10964773"},"title":"Determinants in the envelope E protein and viral RNA helicase NS3 that influence the induction of apoptosis in response to infection with dengue type 1 virus.","abstract":"One mechanism by which dengue (DEN) virus may cause cell death is apoptosis.

The molecular details of how flavivirus NS4A exerts these functions remain elusive. Here, we used dengue virus (DENV) as a model to characterize and demonstrate the biological relevance of flavivirus NS4A oligomerization. DENV type 2 (DENV-2) NS4A protein forms oligomers in infected cells or when expressed alone. Deletion mutagenesis mapped amino acids 50 to 76 (spanning the first transmembrane domain [TMD1]) of NS4A as the major determinant for oligomerization, while the N-terminal 50 residues contribute only slightly to the oligomerization. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of NS4A amino acids 17 to 80 suggests that residues L31, L52, E53, G66, and G67 could participate in oligomerization. Ala substitution for 15 flavivirus conserved NS4A residues revealed that these amino acids are important for viral replication. Among the 15 mutated NS4A residues, 2 amino acids (E50A and G67A) are located within TMD1. Both E50A and G67A attenuated viral replication, decreased NS4A oligomerization, and reduced NS4A protein stability. In contrast, NS4A oligomerization was not affected by the replication-defective mutations (R12A, P49A, and K80A) located outside TMD1. trans complementation experiments showed that expression of wild-type NS4A alone was not sufficient to rescue the replication-lethal NS4A mutants. However, the presence of DENV-2 replicons could partially restore the replication defect of some lethal NS4A mutants (L26A and K80A), but not others (L60A and E122A), suggesting an unidentified mechanism governing the outcome of complementation in a mutant-dependent manner. Collectively, the results have demonstrated the importance of TMD1-mediated NS4A oligomerization in flavivirus replication. IMPORTANCE We report that DENV NS4A forms oligomers. Such NS4A oligomerization is mediated mainly through amino acids 50 to 76 (spanning the first transmembrane domain [TMD1]). The biological importance of NS4A oligomerization is demonstrated by results showing that mutations of flavivirus conserved residues (E50A and G67A located within TMD1) reduced the oligomerization and stability of the NS4A protein, leading to attenuated viral replication. A systematic mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that flavivirus conserved NS4A residues are important for DENV replication. A successful trans complementation of replication-lethal NS4A mutant virus requires wild-type NS4A in the context of the viral replication complex. The wild-type NS4A protein alone is not sufficient to rescue the replication defect of NS4A mutants. Intriguingly, distinct NS4A mutants yielded different complementation outcomes in the replicon-containing cells. Overall, the study has enhanced our understanding of flavivirus NS4A at the molecular level. The results also suggest that inhibitor blocking of NS4A oligomerization could be explored for antiviral drug discovery.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The biological importance of NS4A oligomerization is demonstrated by results showing that mutations of flavivirus conserved residues reduced the oligomersization and stability of the NS4 a protein, leading to attenuated viral replication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4217,"details":{"paperId":"3b6f23e7d8f5656513b76085af4a20908d6bcc52","externalIds":{"MAG":"2158872146","DOI":"10.1099/vir.0.034793-0","CorpusId":"9918161","PubMed":"21733886"},"title":"Determinants of attenuation in the envelope protein of the flavivirus Alfuy.","abstract":"Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus endemic to Australia and Papua New Guinea.

The viral replication machinery containing the core non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is implicated in severe dengue symptoms but molecular details remain obscure. To date, studies seeking to catalogue and characterize interaction networks between viral NS5 and host proteins have been limited to the yeast two-hybrid system, computational prediction and co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of ectopically expressed NS5. However, these traditional approaches do not reproduce a natural course of infection in which a number of DENV NS proteins colocalize and tightly associate during the replication process. Here, we demonstrate the development of a recombinant DENV that harbours a TAP tag in NS5 to study host-virus interactions in vivo. We show that our engineered DENV was infective in several human cell lines and that the tags were stable over multiple viral passages, suggesting negligible structural and functional disturbance of NS5. We further provide proof-of-concept for the use of rationally tagged virus by revealing a high confidence NS5 interaction network in human hepatic cells. Our analysis uncovered previously unrecognized hnRNP complexes and several low-abundance fatty acid metabolism genes, which have been implicated in the viral life cycle.

These sfRNAs are formed by structured RNA elements in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genomic RNA, which block the progression of host cell exoribonucleases that have targeted the viral RNA for destruction. Previous work on these exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) from mosquito-borne FVs revealed a specific 3-dimensional fold with a unique topology in which a ring-like structure protectively encircles the 5′ end of the xrRNA. Conserved nucleotides make specific tertiary interactions that support this fold. Examination of more divergent FVs reveals differences in their 3′ UTR sequences, raising the question of whether they contain xrRNAs and if so, how they fold. To answer this, we demonstrated the presence of an authentic xrRNA in the 3′ UTR of the Tamana Bat Virus (TABV) and solved its structure by x-ray crystallography. The structure reveals conserved features from previously characterized xrRNAs, but in the TABV version these features are created through a novel set of tertiary interactions not previously seen in xrRNAs. This includes two important A-C interactions, four distinct backbone kinks, several ordered Mg2+ ions, and a C+-G-C base triple.

Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the expression levels of TLR2, 3, 4 and 9 and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 by flow cytometry. This was evaluated in monocytes, in myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDCs and pDCs) from 30 dengue patients with different clinical outcomes and in 20 healthy controls. Increased expression of TLR3 and TLR9 in DCs of patients with dengue fever (DF) early in infection was detected. In DCs from patients with severe manifestations, poor stimulation of TLR3 and TLR9 was observed. In addition, we found a lower expression of TLR2 in patients with DF compared to DHF.

Unlike cleavage of the prM of other flaviviruses, cleavage of dengue virus prM is incomplete in many cell lines; the partial cleavage reflects the influence of residues at furin nonconsensus positions of the pr-M junction, as flaviviruses share basic residues at positions P1, P2, and P4, recognized by furin. In this study, viruses harboring the alanine-scanning and other multiple-point mutations of the pr-M junction were generated, employing a dengue virus background that exhibited 60 to 70% prM cleavage and a preponderance of virion-sized extracellular particles. Analysis of prM and its cleavage products in viable mutants revealed a cleavage-suppressive effect at the conserved P3 Glu residue, as well as the cleavage-augmenting effects at the P5 Arg and P6 His residues, indicating an interplay between opposing modulatory influences mediated by these residues on the cleavage of the pr-M junction. Changes in the prM cleavage level were associated with altered proportions of extracellular virions and subviral particles; mutants with reduced cleavage were enriched with subviral particles and prM-containing virions, whereas the mutant with enhanced cleavage was deprived of these particles. Alterations of virus multiplication were detected in mutants with reduced prM cleavage and were correlated with their low specific infectivities.

Among the diseases caused by arboviruses, dengue and chikungunya are responsible for a high rate of severe human diseases worldwide. The midgut of mosquitoes is the first barrier for pathogen transmission and is a target organ where arboviruses must replicate prior to infecting other organs. A proteomic approach was undertaken to characterize the key virus/vector interactions and host protein modifications that happen in the midgut for viral transmission to eventually take place. Methodology and Principal Findings Using a proteomics differential approach with two-Dimensional Differential in-Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), we defined the protein modulations in the midgut of Aedes aegypti that were triggered seven days after an oral infection (7 DPI) with dengue 2 (DENV-2) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses. Gel profile comparisons showed that the level of 18 proteins was modulated by DENV-2 only and 12 proteins were modulated by CHIKV only. Twenty proteins were regulated by both viruses in either similar or different ways. Both viruses caused an increase of proteins involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species, energy production, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Midgut infection by DENV-2 and CHIKV triggered an antioxidant response. CHIKV infection produced an increase of proteins involved in detoxification. Conclusion/Significance Our study constitutes the first analysis of the protein response of Aedes aegypti's midgut infected with viruses belonging to different families. It shows that the differentially regulated proteins in response to viral infection include structural, redox, regulatory proteins, and enzymes for several metabolic pathways. Some of these proteins like antioxidant are probably involved in cell protection.

Dengue virus-specific T cell responses directed against an overlapping 15mer peptide library spanning the DENV 2 proteome were analyzed ex vivo by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, and recognition of individual peptides was further characterized in specific T cell lines. Thirty novel T cell epitopes were identified, 9 of which are CD4+ and 21 are CD8+ T cell epitopes. We observe that whereas CD8+ T cell epitopes preferentially target nonstructural proteins (NS3 and NS5), CD4+ epitopes are skewed toward recognition of viral components that are also targeted by B lymphocytes (envelope, capsid, and NS1). Consistently, a large proportion of dengue virus-specific CD4+ T cells have phenotypic characteristics of circulating follicular helper T cells (CXCR5 expression and production of interleukin-21 or gamma interferon), suggesting that they are interacting with B cells in vivo.

Many of the nonenzymatic viral proteins, such as NS4B, are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. How these membrane proteins function in viral replication is poorly understood. Here we report a robust method to express and purify dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus NS4B proteins. The NS4B proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, reconstituted in dodecyl maltoside (DDM) detergent micelles, and purified to >95% homogeneity. The recombinant NS4B proteins dimerized in vitro, as evidenced by gel filtration, chemical cross-linking, and multiangle light scattering experiments. The dimeric form of NS4B was also detected when the protein was expressed alone in cells as well as in cells infected with DENV type 2 (DENV-2). Mutagenesis analysis showed that the cytosolic loop (amino acids 129 to 165) and the C-terminal region (amino acids 166 to 248) are responsible for NS4B dimerization. trans-Complementation experiments showed that (i) two genome-length RNAs containing distinct NS4B lethal mutations could not trans-complement each other, (ii) the replication defect of NS4B mutant RNA could be restored in cells containing DENV-2 replicons, and (iii) expression of wild-type NS4B protein alone was not sufficient to restore the replication of the NS4B mutant RNA. Collectively, the results indicate that trans-complementation of a lethal NS4B mutant RNA requires wild-type NS4B presented from a replication complex. IMPORTANCE The reported expression and purification system has made it possible to study the biochemistry and structure of flavivirus NS4B proteins. The finding of flavivirus NS4B dimerization and the mapping of regions important for NS4B dimerization provide the possibility to inhibit viral replication through blocking NS4B dimerization. The requirement of NS4B in the context of the replication complex for successful trans-complementation enhances our understanding of NS4B in flavivirus replication.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A robust method to express and purify dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus NS4B proteins and indicates that trans-complementation of a lethal NS 4B mutant RNA requires wild-type NS4 B presented from a replication complex, which enhances the understanding ofNS4B in flavivirus replication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1473,"details":{"paperId":"a6bb4260402704d949cf60d1e2cac7f8e792da03","externalIds":{"MAG":"2047683488","DOI":"10.1016/j.chom.2010.07.007","CorpusId":"6847353","PubMed":"20709295"},"title":"Direct complement restriction of flavivirus infection requires glycan recognition by mannose-binding lectin.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The studies show that MBL recognizes terminal mannose-containing carbohydrates on flaviviruses, resulting in neutralization and efficient clearance in vivo, and shows how complement directly restricts flavivirus infection in an antibody-independent fashion."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4271,"details":{"paperId":"7820f86525786fa82179120a94a45eaa4e2eb7f4","externalIds":{"MAG":"2104898502","DOI":"10.1099/VIR.0.82235-0","CorpusId":"23409594","PubMed":"17030864"},"title":"Direct repeats in the 3' untranslated regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses: possible implications for virus transmission.","abstract":"Direct repeats (DRs) of 20-45 nucleotide conserved sequences (CS) and repeated CS (RCS), separated by non-conserved sequences up to 100 nucleotides long, were previously described in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the three major mosquito-borne flavivirus (MBFV) subgroups, represented by Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus and Dengue virus.

Distinct RNA elements are required for the methylations at guanine N-7 on the cap and ribose 2′-OH on the first transcribed nucleotide. In a West Nile virus (WNV) model, N-7 cap methylation requires specific nucleotides at the second and third positions and a 5′ stem-loop structure; in contrast, 2′-OH ribose methylation requires specific nucleotides at the first and second positions, with a minimum 5′ viral RNA of 20 nucleotides. The cap analogues GpppA and m7GpppA are not active substrates for WNV methytransferase. Footprinting experiments using Gppp- and m7Gppp-terminated RNAs suggest that the 5′ termini of RNA substrates interact with NS5 during the sequential methylation reactions.

In the current study, we attempted to develop a novel in vitro DC model using immature DCs derived from the myeloid leukaemia cell line MUTZ‐3 (IMDCs) to investigate the DENV–DC interaction. The IMDCs morphologically and phenotypically resembled human immature monocyte‐derived dendritic cells (IMMoDCs). However, the permissiveness of IMDCs to DENV2 was lower than that of IMMoDCs. RT‐PCR arrays showed that a group of type I interferon (IFN) ‐inducible genes, especially IFIT1, IFITM1, and IFI27, were significantly up‐regulated in IMMoDCs but not in IMDCs after DENV2 infection. Further investigation revealed that IFIT genes were spontaneously expressed at both transcriptional and protein levels in the naive IMDCs but not in the naive IMMoDCs. It is possible that the poor permissiveness of IMDCs to DENV2 was a result of the high basal levels of IFIT proteins.

The role of TGF-β1 on dengue is not clear; few studies have been published, and most of them from patient sera data, with both protective and pathological roles have described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of TGF-β1 to regulate the secretion of IL-1β in macrophages infected by DENV using THP-1 cells treated with recombinant TGF-β1 before or after DENV infection. By RT-PCR we did not observe a difference in IL-1β expression between infected cells pretreated with TGF-β1 and those that were not. However, secretion of IL-1β was reduced only in cells stimulated with TGF-β1 before infection, and not in those treated 2 hours post-infection.

The clinical manifestations of DF range from asymptomatic to severe and even fatal.

Viral replication occurs within virus-induced vesicular invaginations in the ER membrane. A hallmark of flavivirus infection is expansion of the ER membrane which can be observed at specific time points post infection. However, this process has not been effectively visualized in living cells throughout the course of infection at the single cell resolution. In this study, we developed a plasmid-based reporter system to monitor flavivirus infection and simultaneous virus-induced manipulation of single cells throughout the course of infection in real-time. This system requires viral protease cleavage to release an ER-anchored fluorescent protein infection reporter that is fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS). This proteolytic cleavage allows for the translocation of the infection reporter signal to the nucleus while an ER-specific fluorescent marker remains localized in the lumen. Thus, the construct allows for the visualization of virus-dependent changes to the ER throughout the course of infection. In this study, we show that our reporter was efficiently cleaved upon the expression of multiple flavivirus proteases, including dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). We also found that the DENV protease-dependent cleavage of our ER-anchored reporter exhibited more stringent cleavage sequence specificity than what has previously been shown with biochemical assays. Using this system for long term time-lapse imaging of living cells infected with DENV, we observed nuclear translocation of the reporter signal beginning approximately 8 hours post-infection, which continued to increase throughout the time course. Interestingly, we found that increased reporter signal translocation correlated with increased ER signal intensity, suggesting a positive association between DENV infection and ER expansion in a time-dependent manner. Overall, this report demonstrates that the FlavER platform provides a useful tool for monitoring flavivirus infection and simultaneously observing virus-dependent changes to the host cell ER, allowing for study of the temporal nature of virus-host interactions.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This report demonstrates that the FlavER platform provides a useful tool for monitoring flavivirus infection and simultaneously observing virus-dependent changes to the host cell ER, allowing for study of the temporal nature of virus-host interactions."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":8237,"details":{"paperId":"a9c9f97c7d70a57722bd51a182f8e05de897dee5","externalIds":{"MAG":"2047382488","DOI":"10.4161/rna.8.2.14992","CorpusId":"35149300","PubMed":"21593583"},"title":"Dynamic RNA structures in the dengue virus genome","abstract":"Dengue virus is an important human pathogen that belongs to the Flaviviridae family.

Platelet rich plasma was assessed for DC SIGN, FcϒR2A levels and platelets separated from dengue patients were subjected to RNA extraction and detection of presence of viral RNA. The study observed a decreased expression of DC-SIGN and FcϒR2A on platelets in dengue patients compared to OFI group on all the time points.

Transmission of these viruses depends on their ability to infect, replicate and disseminate from several tissues in the mosquito vector. The metabolic environments within these tissues play crucial roles in these processes. Since these viruses are enveloped, viral replication, assembly and release occur on cellular membranes primed through the manipulation of host metabolism. Interference with this virus infection-induced metabolic environment is detrimental to viral replication in human and mosquito cell culture models. Here we present the first insight into the metabolic environment induced during arbovirus replication in Aedes aegypti. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have analyzed the temporal metabolic perturbations that occur following dengue virus infection of the midgut tissue. This is the primary site of infection and replication, preceding systemic viral dissemination and transmission. We identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic-profile across early-, mid- and late-infection time points. We observed a marked increase in the lipid content. An increase in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and fatty acyls was coincident with the kinetics of viral replication. Elevation of glycerolipid levels suggested a diversion of resources during infection from energy storage to synthetic pathways. Elevated levels of acyl-carnitines were observed, signaling disruptions in mitochondrial function and possible diversion of energy production. A central hub in the sphingolipid pathway that influenced dihydroceramide to ceramide ratios was identified as critical for the virus life cycle.

Currently, the pathogenesis of severe dengue is not elucidated thoroughly, and there are no known therapeutic targets for controlling the disease effectively.

In this study, the long non-coding RNA, ERG-associated lncRNA (lncRNA-ERGAL), was activated and significantly up-regulated in DENV-infected vascular endothelial cells. After knockdown of lncRNA-ERGAL, the expression of ERG, VE-cadherin, and claudin-5 was repressed; besides, cell apoptosis was enhanced, and cytoskeletal remodeling was disordered, leading to instability and increased permeability of vascular endothelial barrier during DENV infection.

Using laser scanning confocal and differential interference contrast microscopy, we demonstrate that rearrangement and expansion of the ER occurs early after DENV-2 infection. Through the use of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells deficient in XBP1 and ATF6, we show that ER rearrangement early after DENV infection is independent of the UPR. We then demonstrate that enlargement of the ER is independent of the SREBP-2 activation and upregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme-A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We further show that this ER rearrangement is not inhibited by the treatment of DENV-infected cells with the cholesterol-inhibiting drug lovastatin. Using the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide, we show that de novo viral protein synthesis but not host transcription is necessary for expansion and rearrangement of the ER. Lastly, we demonstrate that viral infection induces the reabsorption of lipid droplets into the ER.

A. Khromykh, M. T. Kenney, and E. G. Westaway, J. Virol. 72:7270–7279, 1998). In order to identify whether this complementation of FLdGDD RNA was provided by the wild-type NS5 protein alone or with the help of other nonstructural (NS) proteins also expressed in repBHK cells, we generated BHK cell lines stably producing the individual NS5 protein (SRns5BHK) or the NS1-NS5 polyprotein (SRns1-5BHK) by using a heterologous expression vector based on a modified noncytopathic Sindbis replicon. Western blot analysis with anti-NS5 antibodies showed that the level of production of NS5 was significantly higher in SRns5BHK cells than in SRns1-5BHK cells. Despite the higher level of expressed NS5,trans-complementation of FLdGDD RNA was much less efficient in SRns5BHK cells than in SRns1-5BHK cells and produced at least 100-fold less of the secreted complemented virus.

The presence of KUN replicon RNA in encapsidated particles was demonstrated by its amplification and expression in newly infected BHK-21 cells, detected by Northern blotting with a KUN-specific probe and by immunofluorescence analysis with anti-NS3 antibodies. No infectious particles were produced when C20DXrep RNA and recombinant SFV RNAs were electroporated simultaneously. When the second electroporation was performed with a single SFV replicon RNA expressing the KUN contiguous prME genes and the KUN C gene together but under control of two separate 26S subgenomic promoters (SFV-prME-C107), a 10-fold-higher titer of infectious particles was achieved than when two different SFV replicon RNAs expressing the KUN C gene (SFV-C107) and prME genes (SFV-prME) separately were used. No SFV replicon RNAs expressing KUN structural proteins were encapsidated in secreted particles. Infectious particles pelleted by ultracentrifugation of the culture fluid from cells sequentially transfected with C20DXrep and SFV-prME-C107 RNAs were neutralized by preincubation with monoclonal antibodies to KUN E protein.

The NS2B3 protease complex of DENV has recently been shown to cleave the antiviral protein STING and thereby subvert the innate immune signaling to facilitate virus replication. Whether host cells have a mechanism to counteract this virus-mediated immunosuppression is unclear. We discovered that the K27-linked polyubiquitination of NS3 protein facilitates its recruitment of NS2B, the formation of NS2B3, and consequently the enhanced cleavage of STING. However, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein, SCAP, through binding to NS2B protein, inhibits the ubiquitination of NS3, rendering NS2B3 protease incapable of binding and cleaving STING. Importantly, ectopic expression of SCAP impaired DENV infection, whereas silencing of SCAP potentiated DENV infection.

ABSTRACT Many positive-stranded RNA viruses encode polyproteins from which viral proteins are generated by processing the polyproteins. This system produces an equal amount of each viral protein, though the required amounts for each protein are not the same. In this study, we found the extra membrane-anchored nonstructural (NS) proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus are rapidly and selectively degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Our gene targeting study revealed that ERAD involving Derlin2 and SEL1L, but not Derlin1, is required for the viral genome replication. Derlin2 is predominantly localized in the convoluted membrane (CM) of the viral replication organelle, and viral NS proteins are degraded in the CM. Hence, these results suggest that viral protein homeostasis is regulated by Derlin2-mediated ERAD in the CM, and this process is critical for the propagation of these viruses.

Since protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) reducing function at the cell surface was shown to be required for entry of certain viruses and bacteria, we explored the role of PDI expressed on endothelial cell surface in DENV infection. Using siRNA to knock down PDI, DENV infection was reduced which could be reversed by treating cells with a reducing agent Tris(2‐carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP).

These results suggested that the E protein of Kunjin virus was not glycosylated, a feature not shared with MVEV and West Nile virus (WNV), whose properties were consistent with the presence of oligosaccharides attached to the envelope proteins. When Kunjin virions were labelled with radioactive glucosamine, the label was contained in GP19 (formerly NV2).

Using the M-fold program for RNA secondary-structure predictions, we examined for the first time the base-pairing interactions between the covalently linked 5′ genomic region (first ∼160 nucleotides) and the 3′ untranslated region (last ∼115 nucleotides) for a range of mosquito-borneFlavivirus species. Base-pairing occurred as predicted for the previously proposed conserved cyclization sequences. In order to obtain experimental evidence of the predicted interactions, the putative cyclization sequences (5′ or 3′) in the replicon RNA of the mosquito-borne Kunjin virus were mutated either separately, to destroy base-pairing, or simultaneously, to restore the complementarity. None of the RNAs with separate mutations in only the 5′ or only the 3′ cyclization sequences was able to replicate after transfection into BHK cells, while replicon RNA with simultaneous compensatory mutations in both cyclization sequences was replication competent. This was detected by immunofluorescence for expression of the major nonstructural protein NS3 and by Northern blot analysis for amplification and accumulation of replicon RNA. We then used the M-fold program to analyze RNA secondary structure of the covalently linked 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of three tick-borne virus species and identified a previously undescribed additional pair of conserved complementary sequences in locations similar to those of the mosquito-borne species. They base-paired with ΔG values of approximately −20 kcal, equivalent or greater in stability than those calculated for the originally proposed cyclization sequences. The results show that the base-pairing between 5′ and 3′ complementary sequences, rather than the nucleotide sequence per se, is essential for the replication of mosquito-borne Kunjin virus RNA and that more than one pair of cyclization sequences might be involved in the replication of the tick-borne Flavivirusspecies.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results show that the base-pairing between 5′ and 3′ complementary sequences, rather than the nucleotide sequence per se, is essential for the replication of mosquito-borne Kunjin virus RNA and that more than one pair of cyclization sequences might be involved in the replicate of the tick-borne Flavivirusspecies."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4865,"details":{"paperId":"0a9d1ea97e7afdc71233166b6fd7d8609be72f01","externalIds":{"MAG":"2142371145","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.00116-07","CorpusId":"23763805","PubMed":"17459925"},"title":"Essential Role of Dengue Virus Envelope Protein N Glycosylation at Asparagine-67 during Viral Propagation","abstract":"ABSTRACT Dengue virus envelope protein (E) contains two N-linked glycosylation sites, at Asn-67 and Asn-153. The glycosylation site at position 153 is conserved in most flaviviruses, while the site at position 67 is thought to be unique for dengue viruses. N-linked oligosaccharide side chains on flavivirus E proteins have been associated with viral morphogenesis, infectivity, and tropism. Here, we examined the relevance of each N-linked glycan on dengue virus E protein by removing each site in the context of infectious viral particles. Dengue viruses lacking Asn-67 were able to infect mammalian cells and translate and replicate the viral genome, but production of new infectious particles was abolished. In addition, dengue viruses lacking Asn-153 in the E showed reduced infectivity. In contrast, ablation of one or both glycosylation sites yielded viruses that replicate and propagate in mosquito cells. Furthermore, we found a differential requirement of N-linked glycans for E secretion in mammalian and mosquito cells. While secretion of E lacking Asn-67 was efficient in mosquito cells, secretion of the same protein expressed in mammalian cells was dramatically impaired. Finally, we found that viruses lacking the carbohydrate at position 67 showed reduced infection of immature dendritic cells, suggesting interaction between this glycan and the lectin DC-SIGN.

Treatment is supportive. Activation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor (PAFR) on endothelial cells and leukocytes induces increase in vascular permeability, hypotension, and production of cytokines. We hypothesized that activation of PAFR could account for the major systemic manifestations of dengue infection. Inoculation of adult mice with an adapted strain of Dengue virus caused a systemic disease, with several features of the infection in humans. In PAFR−/− mice, there was decreased thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, decreased systemic levels of cytokines, and delay of lethality, when compared with WT infected mice. Treatment with UK-74,505, an orally active PAFR antagonist, prevented the above-mentioned manifestations, as well as hypotension and increased vascular permeability, and decreased lethality, even when started 5 days after virus inoculation. Similar results were obtained with a distinct PAFR antagonist, PCA-4246. Despite decreased disease manifestation, viral loads were similar (PAFR−/−) or lower (PAFR antagonist) than in WT mice. Thus, activation of PAFR plays a major role in the pathogenesis of experimental dengue infection, and its blockade prevents more severe disease manifestation after infection with no increase in systemic viral titers, suggesting that there is no interference in the ability of the murine host to deal with the infection. PAFR antagonists are disease-modifying agents in experimental dengue infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":416,"details":{"paperId":"9c9e116c7b070a79904c7b199d91f709e4ec83cf","externalIds":{"MAG":"2806786068","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-10-8727-1_12","CorpusId":"44162794","PubMed":"29845532"},"title":"Establishment and Application of Flavivirus Replicons.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Different reporter replicons or replicons expressing selectable marker proteins will be outlined using examples of their application to answer basic questions of the flavivirus replication cycle, to select and test antiviral compounds or to produce virus replicon particles."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1307,"details":{"paperId":"44b8b4174f9edcc25ee43f5647c82c3663cd2c1b","externalIds":{"MAG":"1979388905","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.04.004","CorpusId":"20955781","PubMed":"25866185"},"title":"Eukaryotic initiation factor 4AI interacts with NS4A of Dengue virus and plays an antiviral role.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Data suggested that a potential role of NS4A in antagonizing host antiviral defense is by recruiting eIF4AI and escaping the translation inhibition mediated by PKR."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2458,"details":{"paperId":"9743e9afa66286b314a0c613dac9f31d61aadff2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2220384258","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2015.10.021","CorpusId":"13787444","PubMed":"26590794"},"title":"Evaluation of the maturation of individual Dengue virions with flow virometry.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Flow virometry allows us to quantify the number of fully mature particles in DENV preparations and proves to be a useful method for studying heterogeneity of the surface proteins of various viruses."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":8245,"details":{"paperId":"5e0f5454da0455de55e388fefcb466dbbe16d27f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2605720164","DOI":"10.4172/1948-5964.1000E139","CorpusId":"2745173"},"title":"Evasion of Innate Immunity by Dengue Virus Non-Structural Proteins through Interfereing with Type I Interferon Production and Jak/STAT Signaling","abstract":"Dengue Virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne virus, is a member of the Flaviviridae family and transmits to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, most often Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) and Ae.

Methods: Protein and mRNA levels of two AMPs - hBD-1 and cathelicidin LL-37 - were assessed in DENV-infected macrophage-like THP-1 cells using qRT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence. Also, mRNA levels of α-defensins (hDEFAs) and LL-37 were examined by qRT-PCR in human neutrophils taken from peripheral blood and treated with DENV-2.

Mature capsid protein C is freed from the polyprotein by the viral NS2B/3 protease, cleaving in the C-terminal region of protein C in front of the signal sequence for prM. Protein C has been shown to be involved in viral assembly and RNA packaging. To examine further the role of protein C and its production by proteolysis, we replaced the NS2B/3 capsid cleavage site in tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) by the 2A protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (TBEV-2A and WNV-2A). This obviated the need for NS2B/3 processing at the C terminus of mature protein C while simultaneously producing a 19-amino-acid extension on protein C. Infectious virions were generated with both viruses; the phenotype depended on the host cell. TBEV-2A replicated well in BHK-21 cells but was essentially incapable of replication in tick cells. In contrast, WNV-2A replicated well in mosquito cells but showed a small-plaque phenotype in Vero cells, with frequent production of larger plaques. Sequencing of viral RNA from the larger plaques showed substitutions in the signal sequence for prM, presumably improving coordinated protein processing at the C-prM junction. Furthermore, both TBEV-2A and WNV-2A were also defective in unpackaging and/or early RNA synthesis.

Compared with the untreated human umbilical vein endothelial cells, Fas expression was increased both in the mRNA level and on the surface of infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells. FasL was expressed at similar levels on human umbilical vein endothelial cells over a course of dengue virus serotype‐2 infection, but the expression in mRNA level was increased in infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Given their RNA genomes it is not surprising that flaviviral life cycles revolve around critical RNA transactions. It is these we highlight in the present article. First, we summarize the mechanisms governing flaviviral replication and the central role of conserved RNA elements and viral protein-RNA interactions in RNA synthesis, translation and packaging.

The lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream target Akt have been implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular functions such as proliferation, and apoptosis. Since JEV and DEN appear to trigger apoptosis in cultured cells at a rather late stage of infection, we evaluated the possible roles of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in flavivirus-infected cells. We found that Akt phosphorylation was noticeable in the JEV- and DEN serotype 2 (DEN-2)-infected neuronal N18 cells in an early, transient, PI3K- and lipid raft-dependent manner. Blocking of PI3K activation by its specific inhibitor LY294002 or wortmannin greatly enhanced virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPEs), even at an early stage of infection, but had no effect on virus production. This severe CPE was characterized as apoptotic cell death as evidenced by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) staining and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Mechanically, the initiator and effector caspases involved are mainly caspase-9 and caspase-6, since only a pan-caspase inhibitor and the inhibitors preferentially target caspase-9 and -6, but not the ones antagonizing caspase-8, -3, or -7 alleviated the levels of PARP cleavage after virus infection and PI3K blockage. Furthermore, Bcl-2 appears to be a crucial mediator downstream of PI3K/Akt signaling, since overexpression of Bcl-2 reduced virus-induced apoptosis even when PI3K activation was repressed. Collectively, our results suggest an antiapoptotic role for the PI3K/Akt pathway triggered by JEV and DEN-2 to protect infected cells from early apoptotic cell death.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An antiapoptotic role for the PI3K/Akt pathway triggered by JEV and DEN-2 to protect infected cells from early apoptotic cell death is suggested."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":8130,"details":{"paperId":"c304bc5ccf92a5aa228b04309686942652edb602","externalIds":{"MAG":"1502104604","DOI":"10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.7114","CorpusId":"8176401","PubMed":"17082628"},"title":"Flavivirus Activation of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Delineates Key Elements of TLR7 Signaling beyond Endosomal Recognition1","abstract":"TLR7 senses RNA in endosomal compartments.

Modulation of host cell translation therefore represents a frequent strategy by which viruses optimize their replication and spread. Here we sought to define how host cell translation is regulated during infection of human cells with dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), two positive-strand RNA flaviviruses. Polysome profiling and analysis of de novo protein synthesis revealed that flavivirus infection causes potent repression of host cell translation, while synthesis of viral proteins remains efficient. Selective repression of host cell translation was mediated by the DENV polyprotein at the level of translation initiation. In addition, DENV and ZIKV infection suppressed host cell stress responses such as the formation of stress granules and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2). Mechanistic analyses revealed that translation repression was uncoupled from the disruption of stress granule formation and eIF2α signaling. Rather, DENV infection induced p38-Mnk1 signaling that resulted in the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E and was essential for the efficient production of virus particles. Together, these results identify the uncoupling of translation suppression from the cellular stress responses as a conserved strategy by which flaviviruses ensure efficient replication in human cells. IMPORTANCE For efficient production of new progeny, viruses need to balance their dependency on the host cell translation machinery with potentially adverse effects of antiviral proteins produced by the infected cell. To achieve this, many viruses evolved mechanisms to manipulate host cell translation. Here we find that infection of human cells with two major human pathogens, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), leads to the potent repression of host cell translation initiation, while the synthesis of viral protein remains unaffected. Unlike other RNA viruses, these flaviviruses concomitantly suppress host cell stress responses, thereby uncoupling translation suppression from stress granule formation.

They are responsible for causing outbreaks and therefore they represent a serious health issue worldwide (1). Because of the clinical significance of flaviviruses and the severity of epidemics they cause globally, developing efficient vaccines and drugs is critical for the success of disease control measures. Importantly, many flaviviruses, including Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), are vectored though arthropods (arboviruses), mainly mosquitoes and ticks (2). Although most previous efforts have primarily focused on advancing the design of therapeutic strategies for alleviating the disease symptoms caused by flaviviruses, it is equally significant to also be able to interpret the molecular nature of the interactions that take place between flaviviruses and the insect vector and determine whether these interactions affect pathophysiological processes during infection and transmission. Interactions between mosquito vectors and flaviviruses have been studied in several occasions (3). For instance, ZIKV is mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and recent studies have begun to examine vector-virus relationships and transmission dynamics of this virus pathogen (4). Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with ZIKV activate the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism by upregulating several virus-produced short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs and microRNAs. Many of the latter are also regulated by DENV and WNVs, but not by the alphavirus Chikungunya, indicating conservation in the mosquito response to flavivirus infection (5). Flavivirus infection in mosquito vectors activates innate immune signaling, which promotes the induction of antiviral response through the production of effector molecules (6). Activation of JAK/ STAT together with Toll signaling elevates the Ae. aegypti resistance to ZIKV infection, silencing the Toll pathway adaptor MyD88 increases DENV infection in the Ae. aegypti midgut, and DENV infection in this mosquito vector decreases the signaling activity of immune deficiency (Imd) pathway (7–9). Interestingly, the secreted protein Vago limits WNV replication in Culex mosquito cells through induction of JAK/STAT signaling (10).

The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has multiple functions in flavivirus biology and is a target for vaccine development. Dimeric NS1 is essential for replication of the viral genome inside host cells, while hexameric NS1 is secreted and plays a role in evasion of the immune system. Akey et al. (p. 881, published online 6 February; see the Perspective by Shi) report crystal structures for full-length glycosylated NS1 from West Nile and dengue viruses. The structures show a hexamer comprised of three dimers. The structural analysis together with liposome and mutational studies identify a membrane interacting surface on one face of the dimer and an immune evasion surface on the other. The structure of a viral protein provides a basis for understanding its function and could guide vaccine development. [Also see Perspective by Shi] Flaviviruses, the human pathogens responsible for dengue fever, West Nile fever, tick-borne encephalitis, and yellow fever, are endemic in tropical and temperate parts of the world. The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) functions in genome replication as an intracellular dimer and in immune system evasion as a secreted hexamer. We report crystal structures for full-length, glycosylated NS1 from West Nile and dengue viruses. The NS1 hexamer in crystal structures is similar to a solution hexamer visualized by single-particle electron microscopy. Recombinant NS1 binds to lipid bilayers and remodels large liposomes into lipoprotein nanoparticles.

We found that flavivirus NS1 induced the mislocalization of β-catenin and VE-cadherin in a tissue-dependent manner, reflecting flavivirus disease tropism. Mechanistically, we observed that NS1 treatment of cells triggered internalization of VE-cadherin, likely via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and phosphorylation of β-catenin, part of a canonical IJC remodeling pathway during breakdown of endothelial barriers that activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Supporting this model, we found that a chemical inhibitor of GSK-3β reduced both NS1-induced permeability of human umbilical vein and brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers in vitro and vascular leakage in a mouse dorsal intradermal model.

Here, we report that, in epithelial cells, up-regulation of autophagy following flavivirus infection markedly enhances virus replication and that one flavivirus gene, NS4A, uniquely determines the up-regulation of autophagy. Dengue-2 and Modoc (a murine flavivirus) kill primary murine macrophages but protect epithelial cells and fibroblasts against death provoked by several insults. The flavivirus-induced protection derives from the up-regulation of autophagy, as up-regulation of autophagy by starvation or inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin also protects the cells against insult, whereas inhibition of autophagy via inactivation of PI3K nullifies the protection conferred by flavivirus. Inhibition of autophagy also limits replication of both Dengue-2 and Modoc virus in epithelial cells. Expression of flavivirus NS4A is sufficient to induce PI3K-dependent autophagy and to protect cells against death; expression of other viral genes, including NS2A and NS4B, fails to protect cells against several stressors.

Many viruses have evolved various mechanisms to develop their own capping enzymes (e.g. flavivirus and coronavirus) or to 'steal' caps from host mRNAs (e.g. influenza virus). Other viruses have developed 'cap-mimicking' mechanisms by attaching a peptide to the 5' end of viral RNA (e.g. picornavirus and calicivirus) or by having a complex 5' RNA structure (internal ribosome entry site) for translation initiation (e.g. picornavirus, pestivirus and hepacivirus).

Using flavivirus as a model, we summarize how a single methyltransferase catalyses two distinct N-7 and 2'-O methylations of viral RNA cap in a sequential manner. For antiviral development, a structural feature unique to the flavivirus methyltransferase was successfully used to design selective inhibitors that block viral methyltransferase without affecting host methyltransferases. Functionally, capping is essential for prevention of triphosphate-triggered innate immune activation; N-7 methylation is critical for enhancement of viral translation; and 2'-O methylation is important for subversion of innate immune response during viral infection. Flaviviruses defective in 2'-O methyltransferase are replicative, but their viral RNAs lack 2'-O methylation and are recognized and eliminated by the host immune response. Such mutant viruses could be rationally designed as live attenuated vaccines. This concept has recently been proved with Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus.

These viruses enter cells by hijacking an endocytic pathway, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, used by cells to take up growth factors and nutrients. While most cargo is small, virions are large, and we identified host factors specifically required for the internalization of large cargo including these viruses. These studies define a set of requirements for viral internalization and which may be amenable to therapeutic interventions. Flaviviruses enter host cells through the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the spectrum of host factors required for this process are incompletely understood. Here we found that lymphocyte antigen 6 locus E (LY6E) promotes the internalization of multiple flaviviruses, including West Nile virus, Zika virus, and dengue virus. Perhaps surprisingly, LY6E is dispensable for the internalization of the endogenous cargo transferrin, which is also dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for uptake. Since viruses are substantially larger than transferrin, we reasoned that LY6E may be required for uptake of larger cargoes and tested this using transferrin-coated beads of similar size as flaviviruses. LY6E was indeed required for the internalization of transferrin-coated beads, suggesting that LY6E is selectively required for large cargo. Cell biological studies found that LY6E forms tubules upon viral infection and bead internalization, and we found that tubule formation was dependent on RNASEK, which is also required for flavivirus internalization, but not transferrin uptake. Indeed, we found that RNASEK is also required for the internalization of transferrin-coated beads, suggesting it functions upstream of LY6E. These LY6E tubules resembled microtubules, and we found that microtubule assembly was required for their formation and flavivirus uptake. Since microtubule end-binding proteins link microtubules to downstream activities, we screened the three end-binding proteins and found that EB3 promotes virus uptake and LY6E tubularization. Taken together, these results highlight a specialized pathway required for the uptake of large clathrin-dependent endocytosis cargoes, including flaviviruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The finding that lymphocyte antigen 6 locus E (LY6E) promotes the internalization of multiple flaviviruses, including West Nile virus, Zika virus, and dengue virus is found, highlighting a specialized pathway required for the uptake of large clathrin-dependent endocytosis cargoes, including flavivirus uptake."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":3087,"details":{"paperId":"66167a803b66062cbcdecab591763bf689c69d01","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7902656","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-21505-9","CorpusId":"232039375","PubMed":"33623019"},"title":"Flavivirus maturation leads to the formation of an occupied lipid pocket in the surface glycoproteins","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An ordered lipid that is present in only the mature forms of ZIKV, SPOV, and DENV and can bind as a consequence of rearranging amphipathic stem-helices of E during maturation is identified and a structural role for the pocket is proposed and suggested it stabilizes mature E."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4270,"details":{"paperId":"2050537794e7bb6458f8c0d680f3f8f71fb70ed1","externalIds":{"MAG":"2156901830","DOI":"10.1099/VIR.0.82210-0","CorpusId":"36509961","PubMed":"16963734"},"title":"Flavivirus membrane fusion.","abstract":"Flavivirus membrane fusion is mediated by a class II viral fusion protein, the major envelope protein E, and the fusion process is extremely fast and efficient.

WNV is closely related to a number of other medically important flaviviruses that include the family's prototype, the storied yellow fever virus (YFV; flavi means yellow), dengue virus (DV), and the Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses. Much of what we know about flavivirus epidemiology, biology, and pathogenesis derives from collective observations made about these particular flaviviruses. They exhibit both distinctive and shared clinical expression, and their biology appears to be more similar than dissimilar, so that lessons learned from one are likely to apply to the others. The flavivirus single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome encodes three structural (capsid, matrix, and envelope) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (2). Considerable attention has naturally been directed at the biology of the flavivirus envelope E protein because it subserves virus attachment and neutralization. E protein atomic structure has been solved for TBE, DV, and WNV, elegantly informing us about flaviviral entry mechanisms and how neutralizing antibodies protect (3–5). In the course of screening YFV monoclonal antibodies for protective activity in mice a number of years ago, investigators were quite surprised to find that, in addition to protective anti-YFV E monoclonal antibodies, passive transfer of some monoclonal antibodies against YFV NS1 glycoprotein (then known as “gp48”) protected mice against YFV encephalitis (6, 7). Remarkably, active immunization with YFV NS1 also protected monkeys against classic yellow fever (8). The work of Chung et al.

However, unlike other viruses, the flavivirus core appeared to lack an ordered structure. By removing symmetry constraints, it was found that in immature flaviviruses, the nucleocapsid core is asymmetrically positioned with respect to the lipid membrane and glycoprotein shell. Thus, the assembly and budding process leads to imperfect icosahedral symmetry, which may affect virus maturation. Similarly, in the study of many other viruses, icosahedral averaging may have hidden biologically significant events. Flaviviruses assemble initially in an immature, noninfectious state and undergo extensive conformational rearrangements to generate mature virus. Previous cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural studies of flaviviruses assumed icosahedral symmetry and showed the concentric organization of the external glycoprotein shell, the lipid membrane, and the internal nucleocapsid core. We show here that when icosahedral symmetry constraints were excluded in calculating the cryo-EM reconstruction of an immature flavivirus, the nucleocapsid core was positioned asymmetrically with respect to the glycoprotein shell. The core was positioned closer to the lipid membrane at the proximal pole, and at the distal pole, the outer glycoprotein spikes and inner membrane leaflet were either perturbed or missing. In contrast, in the asymmetric reconstruction of a mature flavivirus, the core was positioned concentric with the glycoprotein shell.

It contains an N-terminal serine protease region (residues 1–168) joined to an RNA helicase (residues 180–618) by an 11-amino acid linker (169–179). The structure at 3.15 Å of the soluble NS3 protein from DENV4 covalently attached to 18 residues of the NS2B cofactor region (NS2B18NS3) revealed an elongated molecule with the protease domain abutting subdomains I and II of the helicase (Luo, D., Xu, T., Hunke, C., Grüber, G., Vasudevan, S. G., and Lescar, J. (2008) J. Virol. 82, 173–183). Unexpectedly, using similar crystal growth conditions, we observed an alternative conformation where the protease domain has rotated by ∼161° with respect to the helicase domain. We report this new crystal structure bound to ADP-Mn2+ refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The biological significance for interdomain flexibility conferred by the linker region was probed by either inserting a Gly residue between Glu173 and Pro174 or replacing Pro174 with a Gly residue.

This cleavage event was hypothesized to be effected by a viral protease and to be associated with virion formation. We have proposed a model of flavivirus virion formation in which processing of the C-prM precursor at the upstream signalase site is upregulated by interaction of the NS2B part of the protease with the prM signal peptide or with an adjacent carboxy-terminal region of the capsid protein in the precursor, and processing of Cint by the NS2B-NS3 protease follows the signalase cleavage. Recently, an alternative hypothesis was proposed which suggests a reverse order of these two cleavage events, namely, that cleavage of the C-prM precursor by the NS2B-NS3 protease at the Cint-->Cvir dibasic cleavage site is a prerequisite for the subsequent signalase cleavage of the prM signal peptide. To distinguish between these alternative models, we prepared a series of expression cassettes carrying mutations at the Cint-->Cvir dibasic cleavage site and investigated the effects of these mutations on signalase processing of C-prM and on formation and secretion of prM-E heterodimers. For certain mutated C-prM precursors, namely, for those with Lys-->Gly disruption of the dibasic site, efficient formation of prM was observed upon expression from larger cassettes encoding the viral protease, despite the absence of processing at the Cint-->Cvir cleavage site.

A Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in RlucRep. Transfection of BHK cells with RlucRep RNA yielded two distinctive Rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. By contrast, only the 2- to 10-h Rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase NS5 (RlucRep-NS5mt).

Although a vaccine has been approved in some countries, limitations on its effectiveness and a lack of effective antiviral treatments reinforce the need for additional research. The functions of several viral nonstructural proteins are essentially unknown. To better understand the functions of these proteins and thus dengue virus pathogenesis, we embarked on a genomewide transposon mutagenesis screen with next-generation sequencing to determine sites in the viral genome that tolerate 15-nucleotide insertions. Using this approach, we generated support for several published predicted transmembrane and enzymatic domains. Next, we created 7 mutants containing the 15-nucleotide insertion from the original selection and found 6 of them were capable of replication in both mammalian and mosquito tissue culture cells. Interestingly, one mutation had a significant impairment of viral assembly, and this mutation may lead to a better understanding of viral assembly and release. In addition, we created a fully infectious virus expressing a functionally tagged NS4B protein, which will provide a much-needed tool to elucidate the role of NS4B in viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne virus distributed in tropical and subtropical regions globally that can result in hospitalization and even death in some cases. Although a vaccine exists, its limitations and a lack of approved antiviral treatments highlight our limited understanding of dengue virus pathogenesis and host immunity. The functions of many viral proteins are poorly understood. We used a previously published approach using transposon mutagenesis to develop tools to study these proteins' functions by adding insertions randomly throughout the viral genomes. These genomes were transferred into cells, and infectious progeny were recovered to determine sites that tolerated insertions, as only the genomes that tolerated insertions would be able to propagate. Using these results, we created viruses with epitope tags, one in the viral structural protein Capsid and one in the viral nonstructural protein NS4B.

These elements, termed 5′-CS-A and 3′-CS-A, are conserved among various tick-borne flaviviruses, but they are unrelated to the mosquito-borne CS elements and are located at different genomic positions. The 5′-CS-A element is situated upstream rather than downstream of the AUG start codon and, in contrast to mosquito-borne flaviviruses, it was found that the entire protein C coding region is not essential for TBEV replication. The complementary 3′-CS-A element is located within the bottom stem rather than upstream of the characteristic 3′-terminal stem-loop structure, implying that this part of the proposed structure cannot be formed when the genome is in its circularized conformation. Finally, we demonstrate that the CS-A elements can also mediate their function when the 5′-CS-A element is moved from its natural position to one corresponding to the mosquito-borne CS.

The NS2B/NS3 junction was cleaved before protein purification. A second site at Arg459↓Gly460 within the C-terminal helicase region of NS3 was cleaved more slowly. Autolytic cleavage reactions also occurred in NS2B-NS3 recombinant proteins from yellow fever virus, dengue virus types 2 and 4, and Japanese encephalitis virus.

With these materials, the autolytic cleavages were found to be intramolecular only. Autolytic cleavage of the helicase site was insensitive to protein dilution, confirming that autolysis is intramolecular.

A two-component protease (NS2B-NS3) is essential for maturation, representing an important target for designing anti-flavivirus drugs. Previously, consideration has been centered on developing active-site inhibitors of NS2B-NS3pro. However, the flat and charged nature of its active site renders difficulties in developing inhibitors, suggesting an alternative strategy for identifying allosteric inhibitors. The allosterically sensitive site of the dengue protease is located near Ala125, between the 120s loop and 150s loop. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have explored the protease's conformational dynamics upon binding of an allosteric inhibitor. Furthermore, characterization of the inherent flexible loops (71-75s loop, 120s loop, and 150s loop) is carried out for allosteric-inhibitor-bound wild-type and mutant A125C variants and a comparison is performed with its unbound state to extract the structural changes describing the inactive state of the protease. Our study reveals that compared to the unliganded system, the inhibitor-bound system shows large structural changes in the 120s loop and 150s loop in contrast to the rigid 71-75s loop. The unliganded system shows a closed-state pocket in contrast to the open state for the wild-type complex that locks the protease into the open and inactive-state conformations. However, the mutant complex fluctuates between open and closed states. Also, we tried to see how mutation and binding of an allosteric inhibitor perturb the connectivity in a protein structure network (PSN) at contact levels.

This study aims to improve our understanding of virus entry routs by exploring the sialic acid-based cell surface molecule GM1a and its role in DENV infection. The interaction of the virus with GM1a was studied using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), imaging FCS (ImFCS) and amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS), and the effect on infectivity and movement of the virus during infection was explored using plaque assays and fluorescence-based imaging and single particle tracking (SPT). GM1a was deemed to interact with DENV at domain I (DI) and domain II (DII) of the E protein of the protein coat at quaternary contacts of a fully assembled virus, leading to a ten-fold increase and seven-fold increase in infectivity for DENV1 and DENV2 in mammalian cell systems respectively.

Response to infection ranges from asymptomatic disease to a severe disorder known as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Despite efforts to control the disease, there are no effective treatments or vaccines. In our search for new antiviral compounds to combat infection by dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1), we investigated the role of galectin-1, a widely-expressed mammalian lectin with functions in cell-pathogen interactions and immunoregulatory properties. We found that DENV-1 infection of cells in vitro exhibited caused decreased expression of Gal-1 in several different human cell lines, suggesting that loss of Gal-1 is associated with virus production. In test of this hypothesis we found that exogenous addition of human recombinant Gal-1 (hrGal-1) inhibits the virus production in the three different cell types. This inhibitory effect was dependent on hrGal-1 dimerization and required its carbohydrate recognition domain. Importantly, the inhibition was specific for hrGal-1, since no effect was observed using recombinant human galectin-3. Interestingly, we found that hrGal-1 directly binds to dengue virus and acts, at least in part, during the early stages of DENV-1 infection, by inhibiting viral adsorption and its internalization to target cells. To test the in vivo role of Gal-1 in DENV infection, Gal-1-deficient-mice were used to demonstrate that the expression of endogenous Galectin-1 contributes to resistance of macrophages to in vitro-infection with DENV-1 and it is also important to physiological susceptibility of mice to in vivo infection with DENV-1.

Transcripts for IL‐8, IL‐1β, osteopontin, GRO‐α, ‐β and ‐γ, I‐309, and some other molecules showed to be upregulated upon infection, whereas others such as MIC‐1, CD27L and CD30L, were downregulated. Four genes were selected for reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction based gene‐expression analysis as a way to partially confirm microarray results. This approach pointed out 25 macrophage‐expressed cytokine‐related genes that could be relevant in DEN‐2 pathogenesis.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1834,"details":{"paperId":"5dfbe4301c1e04aaf3728ea166f75c411d719cda","externalIds":{"MAG":"2028647979","DOI":"10.1016/j.jinf.2009.10.003","CorpusId":"29806726","PubMed":"19837110"},"title":"Gene expression analysis during dengue virus infection in HepG2 cells reveals virus control of innate immune response.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that innate immune pathways are involved in the recognition of Dengue Virus by HepG2 cells, and may contribute to the understanding of the inflammatory responses induced by Dengue virus-hepatocytes interaction during dengue diseases."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":134,"details":{"paperId":"05f7be5590369ada4a59a98fb0319101199eef14","externalIds":{"MAG":"2072092660","DOI":"10.1002/jmv.21486","CorpusId":"24950160","PubMed":"19382257"},"title":"Gene expression profiling by microarray analysis reveals an important role for caspase‐1 in dengue virus‐induced p53‐mediated apoptosis","abstract":"Recently, a dengue virus‐induced apoptosis p53‐ and mitochondria‐mediated were reported in human and animal cells.

This virus-specific incompatibility leads to a lack of initial minus-strand accumulation, suggesting that DEN NS1 is unable to productively interact with the YF replicase. Based on a YF deletion mutant that requires NS1 in trans, a genetic screen for suppressor mutants was used to select virus variants able to utilize DEN NS1. In three independent selections, a single mutation was mapped to the NS4A gene, which encodes a putative transmembrane replicase component.

Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT Cellular factors have important roles in all facets of the flavivirus replication cycle. Deciphering viral-host protein interactions is essential for understanding the flavivirus life cycle as well as development of effective antiviral strategies. To uncover novel host factors that are co-opted by multiple flaviviruses, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome wide knockout (KO) screen was employed to identify genes required for replication of Zika virus (ZIKV). Receptor for Activated Protein C Kinase 1 (RACK1) was identified as a novel host factor required for ZIKV replication, which was confirmed via complementary experiments. Depletion of RACK1 via siRNA demonstrated that RACK1 is important for replication of a wide range of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, including West Nile Virus (WNV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Powassan Virus (POWV) and Langat Virus (LGTV) as well as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, but not for YFV, EBOV, VSV or HSV. Notably, flavivirus replication was only abrogated when RACK1 expression was dampened prior to infection. Utilising a non-replicative flavivirus model, we show altered morphology of viral replication factories and reduced formation of vesicle packets (VPs) in cells lacking RACK1 expression. In addition, RACK1 interacted with NS1 protein from multiple flaviviruses; a key protein for replication complex formation. Overall, these findings reveal RACK1’s crucial role to the biogenesis of pan-flavivirus replication organelles. IMPORTANCE Cellular factors are critical in all facets of viral lifecycles, where overlapping interactions between the virus and host can be exploited as possible avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. Using an innovative flavivirus protein expression system, we demonstrate for the first time the impact of the loss of RACK1 on the formation of viral replication factories known as 'vesicle packets' (VPs). In addition, we show that RACK1 can interact with numerous flavivirus NS1 proteins as a potential mechanism by which VP formation can be induced by the former.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Overall, these findings reveal RACK1’s crucial role to the biogenesis of pan-flavivirus replication organelles and shows altered morphology of viral replication factories and reduced formation of vesicle packets in cells lacking Rack1 expression."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6362,"details":{"paperId":"e0dab4277e390c45cb7858ced6ae54d45f2f906b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2025149858","PubMedCentral":"2907396","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0011671","CorpusId":"15370524","PubMed":"20652028"},"title":"Genome-Wide Expression Profiling Deciphers Host Responses Altered during Dengue Shock Syndrome and Reveals the Role of Innate Immunity in Severe Dengue","abstract":"Background Deciphering host responses contributing to dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the life-threatening form of acute viral dengue infections, is required to improve both the differential prognosis and the treatments provided to DSS patients, a challenge for clinicians.

Using a combined approach to analyse the molecular patterns associated with the DSS-gene signature, we provide an integrative overview of the transcriptional responses altered in DSS children. In particular, we show that the transcriptome of DSS children blood cells is characterized by a decreased abundance of transcripts related to T and NK lymphocyte responses and by an increased abundance of anti-inflammatory and repair/remodeling transcripts.

Here, to elucidate the architecture of the nucleocapsid of DENV serotype 2 and ZIKV, we used a nuclease digestion assay and next-generation sequencing to map the respective vRNA genome wide association with the C protein in vitro.

Viral stimulation of host negative regulatory mechanisms is an alternate method of suppressing the host innate immune response. We examined three key mediators of the innate immune response: NF-KB, STAT1 and STAT2 during HCV infection in order to investigate the paradoxical induction of an innate immune response by HCV despite a multitude of mechanisms combating the host response. During infection, we find that all three are repressed only in HCV infected cells but not in uninfected bystander cells, both in vivo in chimeric mouse livers and in cultured Huh7.5 cells after IFNα treatment. We show here that HCV and Flaviviruses suppress the innate immune response by upregulation of PDLIM2, independent of the host interferon response. We show PDLIM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that also acts to stimulate nuclear degradation of STAT2. Interferon dependent relocalization of STAT1/2 to the nucleus leads to PDLIM2 ubiquitination of STAT2 but not STAT1 and the proteasome-dependent degradation of STAT2, predominantly within the nucleus. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of PDLIM2 results in increased levels of STAT2 following IFNα treatment, retention of STAT2 within the nucleus of HCV infected cells after IFNα stimulation, increased interferon response, and increased resistance to infection by several flaviviruses, indicating that PDLIM2 is a global regulator of the interferon response.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown here that HCV and Flaviviruses suppress the innate immune response by upregulation of PDLIM2, independent of the host interferon response."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7571,"details":{"paperId":"096724ef44d7050bd429487cf2810117c8727de4","externalIds":{"MAG":"2589016211","PubMedCentral":"5316548","DOI":"10.3389/fmicb.2017.00240","CorpusId":"3844542","PubMed":"28265266"},"title":"HELZ2 Is an IFN Effector Mediating Suppression of Dengue Virus","abstract":"Flaviviral infections including dengue virus are an increasing clinical problem worldwide. Dengue infection triggers host production of the type 1 IFN, IFN alpha, one of the strongest and broadest acting antivirals known. However, dengue virus subverts host IFN signaling at early steps of IFN signal transduction. This subversion allows unbridled viral replication which subsequently triggers ongoing production of IFN which, again, is subverted. Identification of downstream IFN antiviral effectors will provide targets which could be activated to restore broad acting antiviral activity, stopping the signal to produce endogenous IFN at toxic levels. To this end, we performed a targeted functional genomic screen for IFN antiviral effector genes (IEGs), identifying 56 IEGs required for antiviral effects of IFN against fully infectious dengue virus. Dengue IEGs were enriched for genes encoding nuclear receptor interacting proteins, including HELZ2, MAP2K4, SLC27A2, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1. We focused on HELZ2 (Helicase With Zinc Finger 2), an IFN stimulated gene and IEG which encodes a promiscuous nuclear factor coactivator that exists in two isoforms. The two unique HELZ2 isoforms are both IFN responsive, contain ISRE elements, and gene products increase in the nucleus upon IFN stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing revealed that the HELZ2 complex interacts with triglyceride-regulator LMF1. Mass spectrometry revealed that HELZ2 knockdown cells are depleted of triglyceride subsets. We thus sought to determine whether HELZ2 interacts with a nuclear receptor known to regulate immune response and lipid metabolism, AHR, and identified HELZ2:AHR interactions via co-immunoprecipitation, found that AHR is a dengue IEG, and that an AHR ligand, FICZ, exhibits anti-dengue activity. Primary bone marrow derived macrophages from HELZ2 knockout mice, compared to wild type controls, exhibit enhanced dengue infectivity. Overall, these findings reveal that IFN antiviral response is mediated by HELZ2 transcriptional upregulation, enrichment of HELZ2 protein levels in the nucleus, and activation of a transcriptional program that appears to modulate intracellular lipid state. IEGs identified in this study may serve as both (1) potential targets for host directed antiviral design, downstream of the common flaviviral subversion point, as well as (2) possible biomarkers, whose variation, natural, or iatrogenic, could affect host response to viral infections.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Overall, these findings reveal that IFN antiviral response is mediated by HELZ2 transcriptional upregulation, enrichment of Helicase With Zinc Finger 2 protein levels in the nucleus, and activation of a transcriptional program that appears to modulate intracellular lipid state."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7189,"details":{"paperId":"e90533127a0b09c14da0cb6d41dfa10a7cbb9a71","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.22159/ajpcr.2021.v14i11.42536","CorpusId":"244355434"},"title":"HEPARAN SULFATE: LANDING SITE FOR THE DENGUE VIRAL STRAINS TO GAIN ENTRY TO THE HOST CELLS","abstract":"Humans usually contract dengue by being bitten by arthropods, and more than 3.6 billion people are at risk per year.

ABSTRACT The circulating microRNA (miRNA) profile has been widely used for identifying potential biomarkers against viral infections. However, data on circulating microRNA expression patterns in dengue patients are scanty. Considering the impact of severity caused by dengue infection, circulating miRNA profiles in plasma of dengue patients may prove to be valuable for developing early prognostic markers for the disease severity. Here, we described an in-depth analytical study of small RNA sequencing data obtained from the plasma of 39 dengue patients. Integrating bioinformatics and in vitro studies, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) (log2 fold change ≥1.5, P < 0.05) associated with dengue disease progression. In comparing miRNA expression pattern with the follow-up samples, nine miRNAs were found to exhibit an altered expression that could distinguish between severe dengue and the convalescent patients. To understand the abundance and specificity of the DEMs in the context of dengue infection and disease progression, eight top-hit DEMs were further validated in the dengue virus-infected cell lines as well as in the patient’s plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT‐PCR) method. Importantly, receiver operating curve analysis further confirmed that the plasma expression pattern of hsa-miR-122-5p could differentiate between different stages of dengue infection (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] = 0.792), and dengue-negative patients with other febrile illnesses (AUC = 0.984). The in silico analysis of DEM target genes suggested an enrichment of the pathways associated with metabolism and inflammation. Our study gives a global view of miRNA expression in the plasma from dengue patients and provides a precious resource of candidate miRNAs involved in dengue infection and disease progression.

Results: Alanine substitutions of nine highly conserved MH domain residues affected assembly of replicon particles and entry, which correlated with impairment in prM cleavage. Conclusion: MH domain residues modulate assembly, maturation, and entry. Significance: These highly conserved residues are potential targets of antiviral strategy. The envelope and precursor membrane (prM) proteins of dengue virus (DENV) are present on the surface of immature virions. During maturation, prM protein is cleaved by furin protease into pr peptide and membrane (M) protein. Although previous studies mainly focusing on the pr region have identified several residues important for DENV replication, the functional role of M protein, particularly the α-helical domain (MH), which is predicted to undergo a large conformational change during maturation, remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of nine highly conserved MH domain residues in the replication cycle of DENV by site-directed mutagenesis in a DENV1 prME expression construct and found that alanine substitutions introduced to four highly conserved residues at the C terminus and one at the N terminus of the MH domain greatly affect the production of both virus-like particles and replicon particles. Eight of the nine alanine mutants affected the entry of replicon particles, which correlated with the impairment in prM cleavage. Moreover, seven mutants were found to have reduced prM-E interaction at low pH, which may inhibit the formation of smooth immature particles and exposure of prM cleavage site during maturation, thus contributing to inefficient prM cleavage. Taken together, these results are the first report showing that highly conserved MH domain residues, located at 20–38 amino acids downstream from the prM cleavage site, can modulate the prM cleavage, maturation of particles, and virus entry.

The amino acid sequence of DEN2pro accommodates the same alpha-helices, beta-sheets and protein-binding domains as its HCVpro counterpart, but the model predicts a number of significant differences for DEN2pro and its interactions with substrates and cofactor. Whereas HCVpro contains a Zn2+-binding site, there is no equivalent metal-binding motif in DEN2pro. It is possible that the structural role played by the zinc ion may be provided by a salt bridge between Glu93 and Lys145.

Because of the lack of a disease model in animals and the complex immune interaction in dengue infection, the study of host response and immunopathogenesis is difficult. The development of genomics technology, microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR have allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much broader scale. We therefore used this approach to investigate the host response in dengue virus-infected cell lines and in patients developing dengue fever. Methodology/Principal Findings Using microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR method to monitor the host response to dengue viral replication in cell line infection models and in dengue patient blood samples, we identified differentially expressed genes along three major pathways; NF-κB initiated immune responses, type I interferon (IFN) and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Among the most highly upregulated genes were the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC, both ligands of the CXCR3 receptor. Increased expression of IP-10 and I-TAC in the peripheral blood of ten patients at the early onset of fever was confirmed by ELISA. A highly upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, viperin, was overexpressed in A549 cells resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication. The upregulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway prompted the testing of proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and ALLN, both of which reduced viral replication.

When the Zika epidemic spread through the American continent and then later to Africa and Asia in 2015, researchers compared the characteristics of the Zika infection to Dengue, considering both these viruses were transmitted primarily through the same vector, the Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes. An important difference to note, however, was that the Zika epidemic diffused in a shorter time span compared to the persisting feature of Dengue infections, which is endemic in many Asian countries. As the pathogenesis of viral illnesses is affected by host immune responses, various immune modulators have been proposed as biomarkers to predict the risk of the disease progression to a severe form, at a much earlier stage of the illness. However, the findings for most biomarkers are highly discrepant between studies. Meanwhile, the cross-reactivity of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells response to Dengue and Zika viruses provide important clues for further development of potential treatments.

In case of pestivirus replication, the C-terminal long amphipathic α-helices of Erns are important for anchoring to viral membrane.

Dengue is an emerging arboviral disease where the severity of illness is influenced by the adaptive immune response to the virus. In this report, we have demonstrated that dengue virus infects and replicates in immature human myeloid DCs. Exposure to live dengue virus led to maturation and activation of both the infected and surrounding, uninfected DCs and stimulated production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and alpha interferon (IFN-α). Activation of the dengue virus-infected DCs was blunted compared to the surrounding, uninfected DCs, and dengue virus infection induced low-level release of interleukin-12 p70 (IL-12 p70), a key cytokine in the development of cell-mediated immunity (CMI). Upon the addition of IFN-γ, there was enhanced activation of dengue virus-infected DCs and enhanced dengue virus-induced IL-12 p70 release. The data suggest a model whereby DCs are the early, primary target of dengue virus in natural infection and the vigor of CMI is modulated by the relative presence or absence of IFN-γ in the microenvironment surrounding the virus-infected DCs.

For Flaviviridae members such as hepatitis C virus and dengue virus (DENV), one of the key subsets of cellular pathways that undergo manipulation is the lipid metabolic pathways, underlining the importance of cellular lipids and, in particular, lipid droplets (LDs) in viral infection. Here, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes that act as key regulators of lipid homeostasis and LD formation could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with all DENV serotypes (1-4) circulating around the world. Using PF-429242, an active-site-directed inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P, we demonstrate that inhibition of SKI-1/S1P enzymatic activity in human hepatoma Huh-7.5.1 cells results in a robust reduction of the LD numbers and LD-positive areas and provides a means of effectively inhibiting infection by DENV (1-4). Pre-treatment of Huh-7.5.1 cells with PF-429242 results in a dose-dependent inhibition of DENV infection [median inhibitory dose (EC50) = 1.2 microM; median cytotoxic dose (CC50) = 81 microM; selectivity index (SI) = 68)] and a ~3-log decrease in DENV-2 titer with 20 microM of PF-429242. Post-treatment of DENV-2 infected Huh-7.5.1 cells with PF-429242 does not affect viral RNA abundance, but it does compromise the assembly and/or release of infectious virus particles. PF-429242 antiviral activity is reversed by exogenous oleic acid, which acts as an inducer of LD formation in PF-429242-treated and non-treated control cells.

A variety of cell types, such as dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells, can be infected by DV. However, despite the role of T lymphocytes in the control of DV replication, there remains a paucity of information on possible DV-T cell interactions during the disease course. In the present study, we have demonstrated that primary human naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are permissive for DV infection. Importantly, both T cell subtypes support viral replication and secrete viable virus particles. DV infection triggers the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, but preactivation of T cells reduces the susceptibility of T cells to DV infection. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity-inducing protein granzyme A is highly secreted by human CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells after exposure to DV in vitro. Additionally, using annexin V and polycaspase assays, we have demonstrated that T lymphocytes, in contrast to monocytes, are resistant to DV-induced apoptosis. Strikingly, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found to be infected with DV in acutely infected dengue patients. Together, these results show that T cells are permissive for DV infection in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this cell population may be a viral reservoir during the acute phase of the disease. IMPORTANCE Infection by dengue virus (DV) causes a flu-like disease that can evolve to severe hemorrhaging and death. T lymphocytes are important cells that regulate antibody secretion by B cells and trigger the death of infected cells. However, little is known about the direct interaction between DV and T lymphocytes. Here, we show that T lymphocytes from healthy donors are susceptible to infection by DV, leading to cell activation. Additionally, T cells seem to be resistant to DV-induced apoptosis, suggesting a potential role as a viral reservoir in humans.

Here, we show that FLJ11286, which we refer to as IRAV, is induced by DENV in an interferon-dependent manner, displays antiviral activity against DENV, and localizes to the DENV replication complex. IRAV is an RNA binding protein and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies) in uninfected cells, where it interacts with the MOV10 RISC complex RNA helicase, suggesting a role for IRAV in the processing of viral RNA. After DENV infection, IRAV, along with MOV10 and Xrn1, localizes to the DENV replication complex and associates with DENV proteins. Depletion of IRAV or MOV10 results in an increase in viral RNA. These data serve to characterize an interferon-stimulated gene with antiviral activity against DENV, as well as to propose a mechanism of activity involving the processing of viral RNA. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae, can result in a life-threatening illness and has a significant impact on global health. Dengue virus has been shown to be particularly sensitive to the effects of type I interferon; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which interferon-stimulated genes function to inhibit viral replication. A better understanding of the interferon-mediated antiviral response to dengue virus may aid in the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we examine the influence of the interferon-stimulated gene IRAV (FLJ11286) on dengue virus replication. We show that IRAV associates with P bodies in uninfected cells and with the dengue virus replication complex after infection. IRAV also interacts with MOV10, depletion of which is associated with increased viral replication.

Viral protein synthesis leads to the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) within infected cells. The IRE1 pathway has been hypothesized to support flavivirus replication by increasing protein and lipid biogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of the UPR in TBFV infection in human astrocytes, neuronal and intestinal cell lines that had been infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) strains Neudoerfl and MucAr-HB-171/11 as well as Langat virus (LGTV). Both TBEV strains replicated better than LGTV in central nervous system (CNS) cells. TBEV strain MucAr-HB-171/11, which is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, replicated best in intestinal cells. All three viruses activated the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway via the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Interestingly, the neurotropic TBEV strain Neudoerfl induced a strong upregulation of XBP1 in all cell types, but with faster kinetics in CNS cells. In contrast, TBEV strain MucAr-HB-171/11 failed to activate the IRE1 pathway in astrocytes. The low pathogenic LGTV led to a mild induction of IRE1 signaling in astrocytes and intestinal cells. When cells were treated with IRE1 inhibitors prior to infection, TBFV replication in astrocytes was significantly reduced.

To identify cellular factors with antiviral activity against flaviviruses, we screened a cDNA library using an iterative approach. We identified a mammalian Hsp40 chaperone protein (DNAJC14) that when overexpressed was able to mediate protection from yellow fever virus (YFV)-induced cell death. Further studies revealed that DNAJC14 inhibits YFV at the step of viral RNA replication. Since replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a member of the related Pestivirus genus, is also known to be modulated by DNAJC14, we tested the effect of this host factor on diverse Flaviviridae family members. Flaviviruses, including the pathogenic Asibi strain of YFV, Kunjin, and tick-borne Langat virus, as well as a Hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), all were inhibited by overexpression of DNAJC14. Mutagenesis showed that both the J-domain and the C-terminal domain, which mediates self-interaction, are required for anti-YFV activity. We found that DNAJC14 does not block YFV nor HCV NS2-3 cleavage, and using non-inhibitory mutants demonstrate that DNAJC14 is recruited to YFV replication complexes. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that endogenous DNAJC14 rearranges during infection and is found in replication complexes identified by dsRNA staining. Interestingly, silencing of endogenous DNAJC14 results in impaired YFV replication suggesting a requirement for DNAJC14 in YFV replication complex assembly. Finally, the antiviral activity of overexpressed DNAJC14 occurs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. DNAJC14 overexpression may disrupt the proper stoichiometry resulting in inhibition, which can be overcome upon restoration of the optimal ratios due to the accumulation of viral nonstructural proteins.

The aim of this study was to identify the lincRNA profile in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and evaluate their potential role in host-pathogen interaction. The majority of previous RNA-Seq transcriptome studies in Ae. aegypti have focused on the expression pattern of annotated protein coding genes under different biological conditions. Here, we used 35 publically available RNA-Seq datasets with relatively high depth to screen the Ae. aegypti genome for lincRNA discovery. This led to the identification of 3,482 putative lincRNAs. These lincRNA genes displayed a slightly lower GC content and shorter transcript lengths compared to protein-encoding genes. Ae. aegypti lincRNAs also demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation even among closely related species such as Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae. We examined their expression in dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Wolbachia infected and non-infected adult mosquitoes and Aa20 cells. The results revealed that DENV-2 infection increased the abundance of a number of host lincRNAs, from which some suppress viral replication in mosquito cells.

Unfortunately, treatment options are currently limited or even unavailable. Thus, the aim of our study was to explore the underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets for co-infection. Methods To further understand the mechanisms underlying co-infection, we used a series of bioinformatics analyses to build host factor interaction networks and elucidate biological process and molecular function categories, pathway activity, tissue-specific enrichment, and potential therapeutic agents. Results We explored the pathologic mechanisms of COVID-19 and dengue co-infection, including predisposing genes, significant pathways, biological functions, and possible drugs for intervention. In total, 460 shared host factors were collected; among them, CCL4 and AhR targets were important. To further analyze biological functions, we created a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis. In addition, common signaling pathways were acquired, and the toll-like receptor and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways exerted a significant effect on the interaction. Upregulated genes were identified based on the activity score of dysregulated genes, such as IL-1, Hippo, and TNF-α. We also conducted tissue-specific enrichment analysis and found ICAM-1 and CCL2 to be highly expressed in the lung. Finally, candidate drugs were screened, including resveratrol, genistein, and dexamethasone.

To gain insights about the mechanism by which Oas1b specifically reduces the efficiency of flavivirus replication, cellular protein interaction partners were identified and their involvement in the Oas1b-mediated flavivirus resistance mechanism was analyzed. Initial difficulties in getting the two-hybrid assay to work with full-length Oas1b led to the discovery that this Oas protein uniquely has a C-terminal transmembrane domain that targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Two peptides matching to oxysterol binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L) and ATP binding cassette protein 3, subfamily F (ABCF3), were identified as Oas1b interaction partners in yeast two-hybrid assays, and both in vitro-transcribed/translated peptides and full-length proteins in mammalian cell lysates coimmunoprecipitated with Oas1b. Knockdown of a partner involved in Oas1b-mediated antiflavivirus activity would be expected to increase flavivirus replication but not that of other types of viruses. However, RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of ORP1L decreased the replication of the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) as well as that of other types of RNA viruses.

Due to the limited coding capacity of the viral genome and the complexity of the viral life cycle, host cell proteins play essential roles throughout the course of viral infection. Host RNA-binding proteins mediate various aspects of virus replication through their physical interactions with viral RNA. Here we describe a technique designed to identify such interactions in the context of infected cells using UV cross-linking followed by antisense-mediated affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we identified interactions, several of them novel, between host proteins and dengue viral RNA in infected Huh7 cells. Most of these interactions were subsequently validated using RNA immunoprecipitation. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing, we showed that more than half of these host proteins are likely involved in regulating virus replication, demonstrating the utility of this method in identifying biologically relevant interactions that may not be identified using traditional in vitro approaches.

A better understanding of the host pathogen interaction is required to develop effective therapies to treat DENV. In particular, very little is known about how cellular RNA binding proteins interact with viral RNAs. RNAs within cells are not naked; rather they are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication. Methodology/Principal Findings Seventy-nine novel RNA binding proteins for dengue virus (DENV) were identified by cross-linking proteins to dengue viral RNA during a live infection in human cells. These cellular proteins were specific and distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus, suggesting a specialized role for these factors in DENV amplification. Knockdown of these proteins demonstrated their function as viral host factors, with evidence for some factors acting early, while others late in infection. Their requirement by DENV for efficient amplification is likely specific, since protein knockdown did not impair the cell fitness for viral amplification of an unrelated virus. The protein abundances of these host factors were not significantly altered during DENV infection, suggesting their interaction with DENV RNA was due to specific recruitment mechanisms. However, at the global proteome level, DENV altered the abundances of proteins in particular classes, including transporter proteins, which were down regulated, and proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which were up regulated. Conclusions/Significance The method for identification of host factors described here is robust and broadly applicable to all RNA viruses, providing an avenue to determine the conserved or distinct mechanisms through which diverse viruses manage the viral RNA within cells.

During infection, small subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) are formed inside the infected host cell as a result of incomplete degradation of the viral RNA genome by cellular exoribonuclease XRN1. Although the full extent of sfRNA functions is to be revealed, these non-coding RNAs are key virulence factors and their detrimental effects on multiple cellular processes seem to consistently involve molecular interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Discovery of such sfRNA-binding host-factors has followed established biochemical pull-down approaches skewed towards highly abundant proteins hampering proteome-wide coverage. Yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) systems represent an attractive alternative approach. To facilitate proteome-wide screens for RBP, we revisited and improved existing RNA-Y3H methodology by (1) implementing full-length ORF libraries in combination with (2) efficient yeast mating to increase screening depth and sensitivity, and (3) stringent negative controls to eliminate over-representation of non-specific RNA-binders. These improvements were validated employing the well-characterized interaction between DDX6 (DEAD-box helicase 6) and sfRNA of DENV as paradigm. Our advanced Y3H system was used to screen for human proteins binding to DENV and ZIKV sfRNA, resulting in a list of 69 putative sfRNA-binders, including several previously reported as well as numerous novel RBP host factors.

DENV-infected cells are known to secrete a large number of partially immature and fully immature particles alongside mature virions. Fully immature DENV particles are considered non-infectious, but antibodies have been shown to rescue their infectious properties. This suggests that immature DENV particles only contribute to the viral load observed in patients with a heterologous DENV re-infection.

Using variation calling, unique wildtype nucleotide positions were selected and analyzed for variant nucleotides between mild and fatal cases. The analysis of variant nucleotides between mild and fatal cases showed 6 positions with a significant difference of p < 0.05 with 1 position in the structural region, and 5 positions in the non-structural (NS) regions.

Dengue infection triggers high fever, severe body aches, rash, low platelet count, and could lead to Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in some cases. There is currently no cure, nor a broadly effective vaccine. The interaction of two viral proteins, nonstructural Proteins 3 and 5 (NS3 and NS5), is required for viral replication in the infected host’s cells. Our computational modeling of NS3 suggested that phosphorylation of a serine residue at position 137 of NS3 by a specific c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) enhances viral replication by increasing the interaction of NS3 and NS5 through structural changes in amino acid residues 49–95. Experimental studies have shown that inhibition of JNK prevents viral replication and have suggested that the plants’ flavonoid Quercetin, Agathis flavone, and Myricetin inhibit Dengue infection. Our molecular simulations revealed that Quercetin binds NS3 and obstructs serine 137 phosphorylation, which may decrease viral replication. This work offers a molecular mechanism that can be used for anti-Dengue drug development. Abstract Dengue virus infection is a global health problem for which there have been challenges to obtaining a cure. Current vaccines and anti-viral drugs can only be narrowly applied in ongoing clinical trials. We employed computational methods based on structure-function relationships between human host kinases and viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) to understand viral replication inhibitors’ therapeutic effect. Phosphorylation at each of the two most evolutionarily conserved sites of NS3, serine 137 and threonine 189, compared to the unphosphorylated state were studied with molecular dynamics and docking simulations. The simulations suggested that phosphorylation at serine 137 caused a more remarkable structural change than phosphorylation at threonine 189, specifically located at amino acid residues 49–95. Docking studies supported the idea that phosphorylation at serine 137 increased the binding affinity between NS3 and nonstructural Protein 5 (NS5), whereas phosphorylation at threonine 189 decreased it. The interaction between NS3 and NS5 is essential for viral replication. Docking studies with the antiviral plant flavonoid Quercetin with NS3 indicated that Quercetin physically occluded the serine 137 phosphorylation site. Taken together, these findings suggested a specific site and mechanism by which Quercetin inhibits dengue and possible other flaviviruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":3124,"details":{"paperId":"34923a531df521e49a8b5931f4d3579f0c45b87f","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-04767-6","CorpusId":"256906844"},"title":"In Vitro Assembly and Stabilization of Dengue and Zika Virus Envelope Protein Homo-Dimers","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Two novel methods for building or stabilizing in vitro E-protein homo-dimers that display quaternary epitopes are presented and the use of human mAbs to stabilize homo -dimers in solution is described."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4869,"details":{"paperId":"1444c3538e9574578b06d8753cdd935fc46934d6","externalIds":{"MAG":"2138353532","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.00170-10","CorpusId":"206791332","PubMed":"20335260"},"title":"In Vitro Reconstitution Reveals Key Intermediate States of Trimer Formation by the Dengue Virus Membrane Fusion Protein","abstract":"ABSTRACT The flavivirus dengue virus (DV) infects cells through a low-pH-triggered membrane fusion reaction mediated by the viral envelope protein E.

During fusion, the E protein homodimer dissociates, inserts the hydrophobic fusion loop into target membranes, and refolds into a trimeric hairpin in which domain III (DIII) packs against the central trimer. It is clear that E refolding drives membrane fusion, but the steps in hairpin formation and their pH requirements are unclear. Here, we have used truncated forms of the DV E protein to reconstitute trimerization in vitro. Protein constructs containing domains I and II (DI/II) were monomeric and interacted with membranes to form core trimers. DI/II-membrane interaction and trimerization occurred efficiently at both neutral and low pH. The DI/II core trimer was relatively unstable and could be stabilized by binding exogenous DIII or by the formation of mixed trimers containing DI/II plus E protein with all three domains. The mixed trimer had unoccupied DIII interaction sites that could specifically bind exogenous DIII at either low or neutral pH.

To understand better the dengue virus‐host interaction, it is important to determine how the expression of cellular proteins is modified due to infection. Therefore, a comparison of protein expression was conducted in Vero cells infected with two different DENV strains, both serotype 2: DENV‐2/NG (associated with dengue) and DENV‐2/16681 (associated with severe dengue). The viability of the infected cells was determined, and neither strain induced cell death at 48 hr. In addition, the viral genomes and infectious viral particles were quantified, and the genome of the DENV‐2/16681 strain was determined to have a higher replication rate compared with the DENV‐2/NG strain. Finally, the proteins from infected and uninfected cultures were separated using two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Compared with the uninfected controls, the DENV‐2/NG‐ and DENV‐2/16681‐infected cultures had five and six differentially expressed proteins, respectively. The most important results were observed when the infected cultures were compared to each other (DENV‐2/NG vs. DENV‐2/16681), and 18 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Based on their cellular functions, many of these proteins were linked to the increase in the replication efficiency of DENV. Among the proteins were calreticulin, acetyl coenzyme A, acetyl transferase, and fatty acid‐binding protein.

Briefly, four hepatoma cell lines (HA22T, Huh7, Hep3B, and PLC) and one nonmalignant hepatocyte cell line (Chang liver) were included, representing various levels of tumorigenicity and differentiation. Our data showed that in these five cell lines, dengue‐2 virus attached to each cell type equally well; however, this virus had higher replication rates and levels of virion production in differentiated Huh7, PLC, Hep3B, and Chang liver cells. Likewise, a lower replication rate was observed in the de‐differentiated HA22T cells. Differentiation‐related factors seem to play an important role in dengue virus replication. Further study showed that sodium butyrate (NaB, a differentiation inducer) treatment enhanced dengue virus replication in HA22T cells. Moreover, we found that the severity of morphologic aberration and the increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels correlated with the virus replication rate in the four infected hepatoma cells. In conclusion, we showed that dengue virus can infect diverse liver cells with differing replication efficiency, which causes cytopathic effects (CPEs) of diverse severity.

Even though both NS1 and DENV were able to induce pro-IL-1β synthesis, only DENV infection triggered caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release by platelets. A more complete thromboinflammatory phenotype was achieved by synergistic activation of NS1 with classic platelet agonists, enhancing α-granule translocation and inducing thromboxane A2 synthesis (thrombin and platelet-activating factor), or activating caspase-1 for IL-1β processing and secretion (adenosine triphosphate). Also, platelet activation by NS1 partially depended on toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), but not TLR-2/6. Finally, the platelets sustained viral genome translation and replication, but did not support the release of viral progeny to the extracellular milieu, characterizing an abortive viral infection.

Effective interferon (IFN) responses are critical to recovery from infection with flaviviruses, and the mosquito-borne flaviviruses can inhibit this response. However, little is known about interactions between IFN signaling and TBE viruses. Langat virus (LGTV), a member of the TBE complex of viruses, was found to be highly sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN. However, LGTV infection inhibited IFN-induced expression of a reporter gene driven by either IFN-α/β- or IFN-γ-responsive promoters. This indicated that LGTV can inhibit the IFN-mediated JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway of signal transduction. The mechanism of inhibition was due to blocks in the phosphorylation of both Janus kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2, during IFN-α signaling and at least a failure of Jak1 phosphorylation following IFN-γ stimulation. To determine the viral protein(s) responsible, we individually expressed all nonstructural (NS) proteins and examined their ability to inhibit signal transduction. Expression of NS5 alone inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN, thus identifying NS5 as a potential IFN antagonist.

Objective To determine the expression of two antimicrobial peptide genes, defensin A and cecropin A, in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with DENV-1. Materials and methods We used the F1 generation of mosquitoes orally infected with DENV-1 and real-time PCR analysis to determine whether the defensin A and cecropin A genes played a role in controlling DENV-1 replication in Ae. aegypti. As a reference, we conducted similar experiments with the bacteria Escherichia coli. Results Basal levels of defensin A and cecropin A mRNA were expressed in uninfected mosquitoes at different times post-blood feeding. The infected mosquitoes experienced reduced expression of these mRNA by at least eightfold when compared to uninfected control mosquitoes at all times post-infection. In contrast with the behavior of DENV-1, results showed that bacterial infection produced up-regulation of defensin and cecropin genes; however, the induction of transcripts occurred at later times (15 days).

DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a conserved glycoprotein that associates with membranes and is also secreted into the plasma in DENV-infected patients. The present study describes a novel mechanism by which NS1 inhibits the terminal complement pathway. We first identified the terminal complement regulator vitronectin (VN) as a novel DENV2 NS1 binding partner by using a yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction was further assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The NS1-VN complex was also detected in plasmas from DENV-infected patients, suggesting that this interaction occurs during DENV infection. We also demonstrated that the DENV2 NS1 protein, either by itself or by interacting with VN, hinders the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and C9 polymerization. Finally, we showed that DENV2, West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) NS1 proteins produced in mammalian cells inhibited C9 polymerization. Taken together, our results points to a role for NS1 as a terminal pathway inhibitor of the complement system.

However, DENV can successfully evade the immune response in order to produce disease in humans. Several mechanisms of immune evasion have been suggested for DENV, most of them involving interference with type I interferon (IFN) signaling. We recently reported that DENV infection of human DCs does not induce type I IFN production by those infected DCs, impairing their ability to prime naive T cells toward Th1 immunity. In this article, we report that DENV also reduces the ability of DCs to produce type I IFN in response to several inducers, such as infection with other viruses or exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, indicating that DENV antagonizes the type I IFN production pathway in human DCs. DENV-infected human DCs showed a reduced type I IFN response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus (SeV), and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection and to the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). This inhibitory effect is DENV dose dependent, requires DENV replication, and takes place in DENV-infected DCs as early as 2 h after infection.

The clinical outcomes (of DENV) can vary from a flu-like illness called dengue fever (DF), to a more severe form, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The underlying innate immune mechanisms leading to protective or detrimental outcomes have not been fully elucidated. Helper innate lymphoid cells (hILCs), an innate lymphocyte recently discovered, functionally resemble T-helper cells and are important in inflammation and homeostasis. However, the role of hILCs in DENV infection had been unexplored. Methods We performed flow cytometry to investigate the frequency and phenotype of hILCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DENV-infected patients of different disease severities (DF and DHF), and at different phases (febrile and convalescence) of infection. Intracellular cytokine staining of hILCs from DF and DHF were also evaluated by flow cytometry after ex vivo stimulation. Further, the hILCs were sorted and subjected to transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare the febrile and convalescent phase samples in DF and DHF. Selected differentially expressed genes were then validated by quantitative PCR. Results Phenotypic analysis showed marked activation of all three hILC subsets during the febrile phase as shown by higher CD69 expression when compared to paired convalescent samples, although the frequency of hILCs remained unchanged. Upon ex vivo stimulation, hILCs from febrile phase DHF produced significantly higher IFN-γ and IL-4 when compared to those of DF. Transcriptomic analysis showed unique hILCs gene expression in DF and DHF, suggesting that divergent functions of hILCs may be associated with different disease severities. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that hILCs function both in cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity during the febrile phase of DENV infection. Conclusions Helper ILCs are activated in the febrile phase of DENV infection and display unique transcriptomic changes as well as cytokine production that correlate with severity.

This study aims to understand the role of dynamin II, endosomes, microtubules (MT) and dynein in the early events of DENV replication. Findings Using double immunoflourescence labelling of DENV-2 infected BHK-21 cells it was observed that the surface envelope (E) protein of the virion associated with dynamin II from 0–30 min post infection (p.i.). The sphincter like array of dynamin II supported its pinchase-like activity. The association with endosomes was observed from 0 min at cell periphery to 30 min in the perinuclear (PN) region, suggesting that internalization continued for 30 min. Association of E protein with alpha-tubulin was observed from 8 h indicating that it was the newly translated protein that trafficked on the MT. Dynein was found to associate with the E protein from 4 h in the cytoplasm to 48 h in the PN region and dissociate at 72 h. Association of E protein with dynein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of dynamitin, which disrupts the dynein complex, resulted in loss of trafficking of viral E and core proteins. The findings corroborated with the growth kinetics assessed by quantitation of viral RNA in infected BHK-21 cells. The detection of E protein at 4 h–8 h correlated with detectable increase in viral RNA from 8 h. The detection of high concentrations of E protein in the PN region at 24–48 h coincided with release of virus into the supernatant starting from 36 h p.i. The dissociation of dynein from E protein by 72 h was coincident with maximum release of virus, hinting at a possible negative feedback for viral protein translation.

Such protein-protein interactions (PPI) constitute molecular determinants of critical pathobiologic traits of viruses, including host-range, zoonotic potential and virulence, and represent realistic targets for anti-viral therapies. To shed light on the pathobiology of TBEV in human, we have resolved the network of PPI established with its human host by interaction proteomics. A high-throughput screen for virus-host PPI was performed involving the complete set of open reading frames of TBEV and the cDNA libraries of Homo sapiens, by means of yeast two-hybrid methodology.

Stem-loop A (SLA), a part of the viral 5′ untranslated region (UTR), is critical for the initiation of dengue virus replication, but quantitative analysis of the interactions between the dengue virus polymerase NS5 and SLA in solution has not been performed. Here, we examine how solution conditions affect the size and shape of SLA and the formation of the NS5-SLA complex. We show that dengue virus NS5 binds SLA with a 1:1 stoichiometry and that the association reaction is primarily entropy driven. We also observe that the NS5-SLA interaction is influenced by the magnesium concentration in a complex manner. Binding is optimal with 1 mM MgCl2 but decreases with both lower and higher magnesium concentrations. Additionally, data from a competition assay between SLA and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) indicate that SLA competes with ssRNA for the same binding site on the NS5 polymerase. SLA70 and SLA80, which contain the first 70 and 80 nucleotides (nt), respectively, bind NS5 with similar binding affinities. Dengue virus NS5 also binds SLAs from different serotypes, indicating that NS5 recognizes the overall shape of SLA as well as specific nucleotides. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is an important human pathogen responsible for dengue hemorrhagic fever, whose global incidence has increased dramatically over the last several decades. Despite the clear medical importance of dengue virus infection, the mechanism of viral replication, a process commonly targeted by antiviral therapeutics, is not well understood. In particular, stem-loop A (SLA) and stem-loop B (SLB) located in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) are critical for binding the viral polymerase NS5 to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. However, little is known regarding the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters driving these interactions. Here, we quantitatively examine the energetics of intrinsic affinities, characterize the stoichiometry of the complex of NS5 and SLA, and determine how solution conditions such as magnesium and sodium concentrations and temperature influence NS5-SLA interactions in solution. Quantitatively characterizing dengue virus NS5-SLA interactions will facilitate the design and assessment of antiviral therapeutics that target this essential step of the dengue virus life cycle.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that dengue virus NS5 binds SLA with a 1:1 stoichiometry and that the association reaction is primarily entropy driven, and how solution conditions affect the size and shape of SLA and the formation of the NS5-SLA complex is examined."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7471,"details":{"paperId":"32b984275a9845e05a5571101e71f8c474aa47f9","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9606609","DOI":"10.3389/fcimb.2022.976843","CorpusId":"252877797","PubMed":"36310869"},"title":"Interactions of host miRNAs in the flavivirus 3´UTR genome: From bioinformatics predictions to practical approaches","abstract":"The genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family includes important viruses, such as Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, Yellow fever, Saint Louis encephalitis, and Usutu viruses.

Dengue fever is viral infectious disease widespread in tropical and subtropical areas that infects nearly 400 million people annually. There are four different virus serotypes (DEN.I-IV) so that a reinfection by a different serotype may lead to a more severe case of the disease: dengue hemorrhagic fever and the dengue shock syndrome. During the infection cycle, the virus has two important steps: the first one is the entry in the host cell; the second one, is the fusion between the viral lipid bilayer and the endosomal membrane. Both steps are mediated by the E Glycoprotein, that is the host of the putative fusion peptide. The fusion peptide has a high degree of homology among the members of the Flaviviridae. In this work, we evaluated the interaction between modified dengue fusion peptide and model membranes through the combination of experiments (fluorescence, SAXS, DSC and Cryo-TEM), and Molecular Dynamics simulations. We evaluated the capacity of the DEN.II 88-123 peptide to promote fusion between vesicles composed by DMPC, DMPC:DMPG (4:1), as well as the ability to perturb the lipid bilayer properties.

The inhibitory effect of IFN was retained even when naked DV RNA was transfected directly into cells, confirming that steps associated with viral entry were not the primary target of IFN action.

Despite severe disease in humans, TBFV infection of natural rodent hosts has little noticeable effect. Currently, the basis for resistance to disease is not known. We hypothesize that the coevolution of flaviviruses with their respective hosts has shaped the evolution of potent antiviral factors that suppress virus replication and protect the host from lethal infection. In the current study, we compared virus infection between reservoir host cells and related susceptible species. Infection of primary fibroblasts from the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus, a representative host) with a panel of vector-borne flaviviruses showed up to a 10,000-fold reduction in virus titer compared to control Mus musculus cells. Replication of vesicular stomatitis virus was equivalent in P. leucopus and M. musculus cells suggesting that restriction was flavivirus-specific. Step-wise comparison of the virus infection cycle revealed a significant block to viral RNA replication, but not virus entry, in P. leucopus cells. To understand the role of the type I interferon (IFN) response in virus restriction, we knocked down signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) or the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) by RNA interference. Loss of IFNAR1 or STAT1 significantly relieved the block in virus replication in P. leucopus cells. The major IFN antagonist encoded by TBFV, nonstructural protein 5, was functional in P. leucopus cells, thus ruling out ineffective viral antagonism of the host IFN response. Collectively, this work demonstrates that the IFN response of P. leucopus imparts a strong and virus-specific barrier to flavivirus replication.

DENV RNA replication requires cyclization of the viral genome mediated by two pairs of complementary sequences in the 5′ and 3′ ends, designated 5′ and 3′ cyclization sequences (5′-3′ CS) and the 5′ and 3′ upstream of AUG region (5′-3′ UAR). Here, we demonstrate that another stretch of six nucleotides in the 5′ end is involved in DENV replication and possibly genome cyclization. This new sequence is located downstream of the AUG, designated the 5′ downstream AUG region (5′ DAR); the motif predicted to be complementary in the 3′ end is termed the 3′ DAR. In addition to the UAR, CS and DAR motifs, two other RNA elements are located at the 5′ end of the viral RNA: the 5′ stem-loop A (5′ SLA) interacts with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and promotes RNA synthesis, and a stem-loop in the coding region named cHP is involved in translation start site selection as well as RNA replication. We analyzed the interplay of these 5′ RNA elements in relation to RNA replication, and our data indicate that two separate functional units are formed; one consists of the SLA, and the other includes the UAR, DAR, cHP, and CS elements. The SLA must be located at the 5′ end of the genome, whereas the position of the second unit is more flexible.

widely assumed that the E protein dimer is stabilized by drug ligands or antibodies in an acidic environment, neutralizing the virus's ability to fuse with human cells. During this process, a large conformational change of the E protein dimer is required. We performed Molecular Dynamics simulations to mimic the conformational change and stability of the dimer in neutral and acidic conditions with the well‐tempered metadynamics method. Furthermore, as a few neutralizing antibodies discovered from dengue patients were reported, we used the same simulation method to examine the influence of a selected antibody on the dimer stability in both neutral and acidic conditions. We also investigated the antibody's influence on a point‐mutated E protein that had been reported to interrupt the protein‐antibody interaction and result in more than 95% loss of the antibody's binding ability. Our simulation results are highly consistent with the experimental conclusion that binding of the antibody to the E protein dimer neutralizes the virus, especially in a low pH condition, while the mutation of W101A or N153A significantly reduces the antibody's ability in stabilizing the E protein dimer. We demonstrate that well‐tempered metadynamics can be used to accurately explore the antibody's interaction on large protein complexes such as the E protein dimer, and the computational approach in this work is promising in future antibody development.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that well‐tempered metadynamics can be used to accurately explore the antibody's interaction on large protein complexes such as the E protein dimer, and the computational approach in this work is promising in future antibody development."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5268,"details":{"paperId":"6a3fc360c855626115eab7c38afc3742e397be0a","externalIds":{"MAG":"1973722620","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.77.14.7856-7862.2003","CorpusId":"21108511","PubMed":"12829825"},"title":"Involvement of Lipids in Different Steps of the Flavivirus Fusion Mechanism","abstract":"ABSTRACT Flavivirus membrane fusion is triggered by acidic pH and mediated by the major envelope protein E. A structurally very similar fusion protein is found in alphaviruses, and these molecules are designated class II viral fusion proteins. In contrast to that of flaviviruses, however, alphavirus fusion has been shown to be absolutely dependent on the presence of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the target membrane, suggesting significant differences in the fusion protein-membrane interactions that lead to fusion. With the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), we have therefore conducted a study on the lipid requirements of viral fusion with liposomes and on the processes preceding fusion, specifically, the membrane-binding step and the fusion-associated oligomeric switch from E protein dimers to trimers. As with alphaviruses, cholesterol had a strong promoting effect on membrane binding and trimerization of the fusion protein, and—as shown by the use of cholesterol analogs—the underlying interactions involve the 3β-hydroxyl group at C-3 in both viral systems. In contrast to alphaviruses, however, these effects are much less pronounced with respect to the overall fusion of TBEV and can only be demonstrated when fusion is slowed down by lowering the temperature. The data presented thus suggest the existence of structurally related interactions of the flavivirus and alphavirus fusion proteins with cholesterol in the molecular processes required for fusion but, at the same time, point to significant differences between the class II fusion machineries of these viruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data presented suggest the existence of structurally related interactions of the flavivirus and alphavirus fusion proteins with cholesterol in the molecular processes required for fusion but, at the same time, point to significant differences between the class II fusion machineries of these viruses."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6207,"details":{"paperId":"a2297b062ddebe7cf9751d7358e09717bfc4b8ce","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4488468","MAG":"790342788","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0003885","CorpusId":"16173130","PubMed":"26132143"},"title":"Involvement of Tetraspanin C189 in Cell-to-Cell Spreading of the Dengue Virus in C6/36 Cells","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) is naturally transmitted by mosquitoes to humans, infecting cells of both hosts. Unlike in mammalian cells, DENV usually does not cause extremely deleterious effects on cells of mosquitoes. Despite this, clustered progeny virions were found to form infection foci in a high density cell culture. It is thus interesting to know how the virus spreads among cells in tissues such as the midgut within live mosquitoes. This report demonstrates that cell-to-cell spread is one way for DENV to infect neighboring cells without depending on the “release and entry” mode. In the meantime, a membrane-bound vacuole incorporating tetraspanin C189 was formed in response to DENV infection in the C6/36 cell and was subsequently transported along with the contained virus from one cell to another. Knockdown of C189 in DENV-infected C6/36 cells is shown herein to reduce cell-to-cell transmission of the virus, which may be recovered by co-transfection with a C189-expressing vector in DENV-infected C6/36 cells. Moreover, cell-to-cell transmission usually occurred at the site where the donor cell directly contacts the recipient cell. It suggested that C189 is crucially involved in the intercellular spread of progeny viral particles between mosquito cells.

Here, we detected increasing secretion of the chemokine RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), which functions to recruit the immune cells, in dengue-virus-infected liver cells and patients. Three luciferase reporter genes with various deletions at the 5'-end of the RANTES promoter were constructed to explore the RANTES activation mechanism in human liver cells. The reporter gene was optimally activated by dengue-2 virus when the RANTES promoter contains the region from the transcription starting site (+1) to the nucleotide at the -181 position. NF-IL-6 and an undefined factor forming DNA-protein complexes in the RANTES promoter E and A/B regions in the infected cells were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Further analysis showed that oxidative stress was an upstream inducer of NF-IL-6 and RANTES signaling in dengue-virus-infected liver cells. This finding was demonstrated by three antioxidants (N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) used to suppress the activation. In contrast, the DNA binding activity of the undefined factor was not affected by the antioxidant treatment, indicating the existence of an oxidant-independent pathway. We hypothesize that dengue virus infection of the liver cells may trigger both an oxidant-dependent and an oxidant-independent pathway to up-regulate RANTES mRNA expression through activating NF-IL-6 and an undefined factor, respectively.

Chemokines produced in DV infection play important immunopathogenic roles. We previously showed that DV infection can directly activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in dendritic cells. In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT3 pathway in chemokine production from DV-infected hepatocytes. HepG2 cells were infected by DV. The activation of STAT3, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and other transcription factors was determined by Western blotting or electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The concentrations of chemokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Virus titers were determined by plaque assays. A genetic manipulation with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was applied to knock-down STAT3. Chemotaxis assays were used to evaluate cell migration. We observed that DV infection induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and its DNA-binding activity and such effects were attenuated by the inhibitor of JAK2 or JAK3. Blocking JAK2 or JAK3 reduced DV-induced cell migration and production of chemokines like interleukin-8 and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). At high doses, the JAK2 but not JAK3 inhibitor could significantly inhibit DV production. Knocking down STAT3 with shRNA suppressed DV-induced STAT3, NF-κB and AP-1 activation. Furthermore, reduction of STAT3 suppressed DV-induced chemokine production and cell migration but had no effect on virus production.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a new approach for miRNA-targeting of tick-borne flavivirus (Langat virus, LGTV) in the duplicated capsid gene region (DCGR). Genetic stability of viruses with DCGR was ensured by the presence of multiple cis-acting elements within the N-terminal capsid coding region, including the stem-loop structure (5′SL6) at the 3′ end of the promoter.

Coexpression of NS3 with apoptotic inhibitors (CrmA and P35) and addition of caspase peptide substrates (Z-VAD-FMK and Z-IETD-FMK) to NS3-transfected cells blocked NS3-induced apoptosis. In cotransfection experiments, NS3 bound to caspase-8 and enhanced caspase-8-mediated apoptosis. NS3 and caspase-8 colocalized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. Deletion analysis demonstrated that at least two regions of NS3 contribute to its apoptotic activities. The protease and helicase domains are each able to bind to caspase-8, while the protease domain alone induces apoptosis.

The disease has caused heavy burdens due to frequent outbreaks in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. The dengue virus (DENV) is generally transmitted between human hosts via the bite of a mosquito vector, primarily Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus as a minor species. It is known that the virus needs to alternately infect mosquito and human cells. DENV-induced cell death is relevant to the pathogenesis in humans as infected cells undergo apoptosis. In contrast, mosquito cells mostly survive the infection; this allows infected mosquitoes to remain healthy enough to serve as an efficient vector in nature. Overexpression of antioxidant genes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutaredoxin (Grx), thioredoxin (Trx), and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) have been detected in DENV2-infected mosquito cells. Additional antioxidants, including GST, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5a), and p53 isoform 2 (p53-2), and perhaps some others, are also involved in creating an intracellular environment suitable for cell replication and viral infection. Antiapoptotic effects involving inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) upregulation and subsequent elevation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities also play crucial roles in the ability of mosquito cells to survive DENV infection.

Phospholipids are structural lipids with a polar headgroup and apolar acyl chains, enabling the formation of lipid bilayer that form plasma- and endomembranes. Phospholipids are mostly synthesized through the de novo pathway and remodeling cycle. Variations in headgroup and acyl chains influence phospholipid physicochemical properties and consequently the membrane behavior. Flaviviruses interact with cellular membranes at every step of their cellular cycle. Recent evidence demonstrates that flaviviruses reconfigure the phospholipidome in mosquitoes by regulating phospholipid syntheses to increase virus multiplication. Identifying the phospholipids involved and understanding how flaviviruses regulate these in mosquitoes is required to design new interventions.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The biosyntheses of, biochemical properties of and flaviviral interactions with mosquito phospholipids are reviewed, demonstrating that flaviviruses reconfigure the phospholIPidome in mosquitoes by regulatingospholipid syntheses to increase virus multiplication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6673,"details":{"paperId":"5428b65029e3cff58f429af084a5d9f6b26a646b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2802174066","PubMedCentral":"5944919","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1006952","CorpusId":"13663089","PubMed":"29746606"},"title":"Lipids and pathogenic flaviviruses: An intimate union","abstract":"The viral replication cycle presents viruses with a series of logistical challenges: To be successful, the virus must synthesize new copies of its genetic material, induce the cell to translate its genome into protein, and coordinate the host and viral factors required to assemble new virus particles.

Hepatic dysfunction was identified as a risk predictor of progression to severe disease during the febrile phase of dengue. However, the underlying mechanisms of hepatic injury remain unclear. Methods A model of dengue disease was established in IFNAR −/− C57BL/6 mice by challenge with DENV-2. Body weight, symptoms, haematological parameters and liver pathological observations in mice were used to determine the effects of DENV infection. Liver transcriptome sequencing was performed to evaluate the features of the host response in IFNAR −/− mice challenged with DENV. Functional enrichment analysis and analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used to determine the critical molecular mechanism of hepatic injury. Results We observed haemoconcentration, leukopenia and liver pathologies in mice, consistent with findings in clinical dengue patients. Some differences in gene expression and biological processes were identified in this study.

In the case of flaviviruses, RNA-RNA interactions between the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome have been proposed to be required for RNA replication. We found that two RNA elements present at the ends of the dengue virus genome interact in vitro with high affinity. Visualization of individual molecules by atomic force microscopy reveled that physical interaction between these RNA elements results in cyclization of the viral RNA. Using RNA binding assays, we found that the putative cyclization sequences, known as 5′ and 3′ CS, present in all mosquito-borne flaviviruses, were necessary but not sufficient for RNA-RNA interaction. Additional sequences present at the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of the viral RNA were also required for RNA-RNA complex formation. We named these sequences 5′ and 3′ UAR (upstream AUG region). In order to investigate the functional role of 5′-3′ UAR complementarity, these sequences were mutated either separately, to destroy base pairing, or simultaneously, to restore complementarity in the context of full-length dengue virus RNA. Nonviable viruses were recovered after transfection of dengue virus RNA carrying mutations either at the 5′ or 3′ UAR, while the RNA containing the compensatory mutations was able to replicate. Since sequence complementarity between the ends of the genome is required for dengue virus viability, we propose that cyclization of the RNA is a required conformation for viral replication.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Since sequence complementarity between the ends of the genome is required for dengue virus viability, it is proposed that cyclization of the RNA is a required conformation for viral replication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6701,"details":{"paperId":"6fd06361d5f68b07968ee2fdb13ec5cae9963020","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9089905","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1010163","CorpusId":"244904161","PubMed":"35482886"},"title":"Loquacious modulates flaviviral RNA replication in mosquito cells","abstract":"Arthropod-borne viruses infect both mosquito and mammalian hosts. While much is known about virus-host interactions that modulate viral gene expression in their mammalian host, much less is known about the interactions that involve inhibition, subversion or avoidance strategies in the mosquito host. A novel RNA-Protein interaction detection assay was used to detect proteins that directly or indirectly bind to dengue viral genomes in infected mosquito cells. Membrane-associated mosquito proteins SEC61A1 and Loquacious (Loqs) were found to be in complex with the viral RNA. Depletion analysis demonstrated that both SEC61A1 and Loqs have pro-viral functions in the dengue viral infectious cycle. Co-localization and pull-down assays showed that Loqs interacts with viral protein NS3 and both full-length and subgenomic viral RNAs. While Loqs coats the entire positive-stranded viral RNA, it binds selectively to the 3’ end of the negative-strand of the viral genome. In-depth analyses showed that the absence of Loqs did not affect translation or turnover of the viral RNA but modulated viral replication. Loqs also displayed pro-viral functions for several flaviviruses in infected mosquito cells, suggesting a conserved role for Loqs in flavivirus-infected mosquito cells. Author Summary There is a wealth of information that dictates virus-host interactions in flavivirus-infected mammalian cells, yet there is only sparse information on the mechanisms that modulate viral gene expression in the mosquito host. Using a novel RNA-protein detection assay, the interactions of SEC61A1 and Loqs with the dengue viral genome were found to have proviral functions in infected mosquito cells. In particular, Loqs forms complexes with the positive-strand of the viral RNA and the very 3’ end of the negative-strand viral RNA.

Decades of research in the related Dengue virus (DENV), finally culminating in a vaccine registered for use in endemic regions (CYD-TDV), provides key insights in developing strategies for tackling ZIKV. The previously established MEPP methodology compares two conformations of the same protein and identifies residues with significant spatial and electrostatic perturbations. In the current work, MEPP analyzed the pre-and post-fusion DENV type 2 envelope (E) protein, and identified several known epitopes (His317, Tyr299, Glu26, Arg188, etc.) (MEPPitope). These residues are overwhelmingly conserved in ZIKV and all DENV serotypes. Characterization of α-helices in E-proteins show that α1 is not conserved in the sequence space of ZIKV and DENV. Furthermore, perturbation of α1 in the post-fusion DENV structure includes a known epitope Asp215, a residue absent in the pre-fusion α1. A cationic β-sheet in the GAG-binding domain that is stereochemically equivalent in ZIKV and all DENV serotypes is also highlighted due to a residue pair (Arg286-Arg288) that has a significant electrostatic polarity reversal upon fusion. Finally, two highly conserved residues (Thr32 and Thr40), with little emphasis in existing literature, are found to have significant electrostatic perturbation.

DENV CP forms a dimer via the internal α2 and α4 helices of each monomer. Pairing of α2-α2′ creates a continuous hydrophobic surface, while the α4-α4′ helix pair joins the homodimer via side-chain interactions of the inner-edge residues. However, the importance of dimer conformation and the α4 helix of DENV CP in relation to its function are poorly understood. Loss of association between CP and lipid droplets (LDs) due to mutation suggests that the CP hydrophobic surface was not exposed, offering a possible explanation for the absence of dimers. Further assays suggest the connection between CP folding and protein stability. Attenuation of full-length RNA-derived virus production is associated with CP mutation, since no significant defects were detected in virus translation and replication. The in vitro characterization assays further highlighted that the α4-α4′ helix pair conformation is critical in preserving the overall α-helical content, thermostability, and dimer formation ability of CP, features correlated with the efficiency of nucleocapsid formation. Addition of Tween 20 improves in vitro nucleocapsid-like particle formation, suggesting the role of the LD in nucleocapsid formation in vivo. This study provides the first direct link between the α4-α4′ helix pair interaction and the CP dimer conformation that is the basis of CP function, particularly in nucleocapsid formation during virion production. IMPORTANCE Structure-based mutagenesis study of the dengue virus core protein (CP) reveals that the α4-α4′ helix pair is the key to maintaining its dimer conformation, which is the basis of CP function in nucleocapsid formation and virus production. Attenuation of full-length RNA-derived virus production is associated with CP mutation, since no significant defects in virus translation and replication were detected. In vitro inefficiency and size of nucleocapsid-like particle (NLP) formation offer a possible explanation for in vivo virus production inefficiency upon CP mutation. Further, the transition of NLP morphology from an incomplete state to an intact particle shown by α4-α4′ helix pair mutants in the presence of a nonionic detergent suggests the regulatory role of the intracellular lipid droplet (LD) in CP-LD interaction and in promoting nucleocapsid formation. This study provides the first direct link between the α4-α4′ helix pair interaction and CP dimer conformation that is the fundamental requirement of CP function, particularly in nucleocapsid formation during virion production.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2638,"details":{"paperId":"4e7761d52afbf67dfc35bc642a881d1163dba8f8","externalIds":{"MAG":"2103164678","PubMedCentral":"7252169","DOI":"10.1016/S0065-3527(03)59007-8","CorpusId":"31149779","PubMed":"14696331"},"title":"Manipulation of cell surface macromolecules by flaviviruses","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review examines the cell tropism and pathogenesis of flaviviruses from the standpoint of cell surface molecules, which have been implicated as receptors in both virus–cell as well as cell–cell interactions."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6099,"details":{"paperId":"baff9e82a73e77a021118c0910a5874568cd60b3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2166836960","PubMedCentral":"3039688","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0000954","CorpusId":"8450838","PubMed":"21358811"},"title":"Mapping Protein Interactions between Dengue Virus and Its Human and Insect Hosts","abstract":"Background Dengue fever is an increasingly significant arthropod-borne viral disease, with at least 50 million cases per year worldwide.

We predict over 4,000 interactions between DENV and humans, as well as 176 interactions between DENV and A. aegypti. Additional filtering based on shared Gene Ontology cellular component annotation reduced the number of predictions to approximately 2,000 for humans and 18 for A. aegypti. Of 19 experimentally validated interactions between DENV and humans extracted from the literature, this method was able to predict nearly half (9). Additional predictions suggest specific interactions between virus and host proteins relevant to interferon signaling, transcriptional regulation, stress, and the unfolded protein response. Conclusions/Significance Dengue virus manipulates cellular processes to its advantage through specific interactions with the host's protein interaction network. The interaction networks presented here provide a set of hypothesis for further experimental investigation into the DENV life cycle as well as potential therapeutic targets.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Dengue virus manipulates cellular processes to its advantage through specific interactions with the host's protein interaction network, and the interaction networks presented here provide a set of hypothesis for further experimental investigation into the DENV life cycle as well as potential therapeutic targets."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":494,"details":{"paperId":"d798d28a9c52e24fe4aac8c076fe133dbcdefc3c","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s00018-022-04245-x","CorpusId":"248084088","PubMed":"35397701"},"title":"Mapping of molecular interactions between human E3 ligase TRIM69 and Dengue virus NS3 protease using hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results show the direct interactions of TRIM69 with viral proteins, provide mechanistic insights at a molecular level, and highlight the functional relevance ofTRIM69 interacting with the Dengue viral protein suggest that TRIM 69 may act as a pan-antiflaviviral restriction factor."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5123,"details":{"paperId":"d2643c8b0b6bf51e4618fbeec1bd6135009baa36","externalIds":{"MAG":"2156269187","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.03454-14","CorpusId":"5066287","PubMed":"25589636"},"title":"Mapping the Interactions between the NS4B and NS3 Proteins of Dengue Virus","abstract":"ABSTRACT Flavivirus RNA synthesis is mediated by a multiprotein complex associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, named the replication complex (RC). Within the flavivirus RC, NS4B, an integral membrane protein with a role in virulence and regulation of the innate immune response, binds to the NS3 protease-helicase. NS4B modulates the RNA helicase activity of NS3, but the molecular details of their interaction remain elusive. Here, we used dengue virus (DENV) to map the determinants for the NS3-NS4B interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation and an in situ proximity ligation assay confirmed that NS3 colocalizes with NS4B in both DENV-infected cells and cells coexpressing both proteins. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that subdomains 2 and 3 of the NS3 helicase region and the cytoplasmic loop of NS4B are required for binding. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we found that the isolated cytoplasmic loop of NS4B is flexible, with a tendency to form a three-turn α-helix and two short β-strands. Upon binding to the NS3 helicase, 12 amino acids within the cytoplasmic loop of NS4B exhibited line broadening, suggesting a participation in the interaction. Sequence alignment showed that 4 of these 12 residues are strictly conserved across different flaviviruses. Mutagenesis analysis showed that three (Q134, G140, and N144) of the four evolutionarily conserved NS4B residues are essential for DENV replication. The mapping of the NS3/NS4B-interacting regions described here can assist the design of inhibitors that disrupt their interface for antiviral therapy. IMPORTANCE NS3 and NS4B are essential components of the flavivirus RC. Using DENV as a model, we mapped the interaction between the viral NS3 and NS4B proteins. The subdomains 2 and 3 of NS3 helicase as well as the cytoplasmic loop of NS4B are critical for the interaction. Functional analysis delineated residues within the NS4B cytoplasmic loop that are crucial for DENV replication.

To elucidate the mechanism involved in NS2B-mediated activation of NS3 protease, molecular dynamic simulation, principal component analysis, molecular docking, mutagenesis, and bioassay studies were carried out on both the dengue virus NS3pro and NS2B-NS3pro systems. The results revealed that the NS2B-NS3pro complex is more rigid than NS3pro alone due to its robust hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction networks within the complex. These potent networks lead to remodeling of the secondary and tertiary structures of the protease that facilitates cleavage sequence recognition and binding of substrates.

They function as internal signal and stop-transfer sequences during protein translation, but possible additional roles in protein interactions required during assembly and maturation of viral particles are ill defined. To shed light on the role of TMDs in these processes, we engineered a set of tick-borne encephalitis virus mutants in which these structural elements were replaced in different combinations by the homologous sequences of a distantly related flavivirus (Japanese encephalitis virus). The effects of these modifications were analyzed with respect to protein synthesis, viral particle secretion, specific infectivity, and acidic-pH-induced maturation processes. We provide evidence that interactions involving the double-membrane anchor of the envelope protein E (a unique feature compared to other viral fusion proteins) contribute substantially to particle assembly, stability, and maturation. Disturbances of the inter- and intra-TMD interactions of E resulted in the secretion of a larger proportion of capsidless subviral particles at the expense of whole virions, suggesting a possible role in the still incompletely understood mechanism of capsid integration during virus budding. In contrast, the TMD initially anchoring the C protein to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane does not appear to take part in envelope protein interactions. We also show that E TMDs are involved in the envelope protein rearrangements that are triggered by acidic pH in the trans-Golgi network and represent a hallmark of virus maturation. IMPORTANCE The assembly of flaviviruses occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and leads to the formation of immature, noninfectious particles composed of an RNA-containing capsid surrounded by a lipid membrane, with the two integrated envelope proteins, prM and E, arranged in an icosahedral lattice. The mechanism by which the capsid is formed and integrated into the budding viral envelope is currently unknown. We provide evidence that the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of E are essential for the formation of capsid-containing particles and that disturbances of these interactions lead to the preferential formation of capsidless subviral particles at the expense of whole virions. E TMD interactions also appear to be essential for the envelope protein rearrangements required for virus maturation and for the generation of infectious virions. Our data thus provide new insights into the biological functions of E TMDs and extend their role during viral polyprotein processing to additional functions in particle assembly and maturation.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Evidence is provided that the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of E are essential for the formation of capsid-containing particles and that disturbances of these interactions lead to the preferential formation of Capsidless subviral particles at the expense of whole virions."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2950,"details":{"paperId":"b34652cd7c52b16dc961e00da7f2b64599aba91a","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4148155","MAG":"2996114901","DOI":"10.1021/jp504911r","CorpusId":"14476560","PubMed":"25119664"},"title":"Membrane Interacting Regions of Dengue Virus NS2A Protein","abstract":"The Dengue virus (DENV) NS2A protein, essential for viral replication, is a poorly characterized membrane protein.

Although flavivirus NS2A is known to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, the detailed topology of this protein has not been determined. Here we report the first topology model of flavivirus NS2A on the ER membrane. Using dengue virus (DENV) NS2A as a model, we show that (i) the N-terminal 68 amino acids are located in the ER lumen, with one segment (amino acids 30 to 52) that interacts with ER membrane without traversing the lipid bilayer; (ii) amino acids 69 to 209 form five transmembrane segments, each of which integrally spans the ER membrane; and (iii) the C-terminal tail (amino acids 210 to 218) is located in the cytosol. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural analysis showed that the first membrane-spanning segment (amino acids 69 to 93) consists of two helices separated by a “helix breaker.” The helix breaker is formed by amino acid P85 and one positively charged residue, R84. Functional analysis using replicon and genome-length RNAs of DENV-2 indicates that P85 is not important for viral replication. However, when R84 was replaced with E, the mutation attenuated both viral RNA synthesis and virus production. Remarkably, an R84A mutation did not affect viral RNA synthesis but blocked intracellular formation of infectious virions.

Two structures of the u-shaped protein are generated by separating two assembled TMDs linking them with the membrane-attached domain. Lipid undulation is monitored with the structures embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer applying multiple 200 ns MD simulations at 310 K. An intact structure of the protein supports membrane undulation. The strong unwinding of the helices in the domain-linking section of one of the structures lowers its capability to induce membrane curvature. Unwinding of the link region is due to interactions of two tryptophan residues, Trp-96 and 104.

The outcomes have a significant impact on our understanding of the biology of the virus (and flaviviruses in general) and small RNA biogenesis, and open up a potential avenue for the control of the virus.

Hence, our studies reveal an essential aspect of the pathogenesis of dengue virus infections, which may aid in developing antidengue therapeutics. ABSTRACT Dengue virus infections, which have been reported in nearly 140 countries, pose a significant threat to human health. The genome of dengue virus encodes three structural and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins along with two untranslated regions, one each on both ends. Among them, dengue protease (NS3) plays a pivotal role in polyprotein processing and virus multiplication. NS3 is also known to regulate several host proteins to induce and maintain pathogenesis. Certain viral proteins are known to interact with mitochondrial membrane proteins and interfere with their functions, but the association of a virus-coded protein with the mitochondrial matrix is not known. In this report, by using in silico analysis, we show that NS3pro alone is capable of mitochondrial import; however, this is dependent on its innate mitochondrial transport signal (MTS). Transient-transfection and protein import studies confirm the import of NS3pro to the mitochondrial matrix. Similarly, NS3pro-helicase (amino acids 1 to 464 of NS3) also targets the mitochondria. Intriguingly, reduced levels of matrix-localized GrpE protein homolog 1 (GrpEL1), a cochaperone of mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70), were noticed in NS3pro-expressing, NS3pro-helicase-expressing, and virus-infected cells. Upon the use of purified components, GrpEL1 undergoes cleavage, and the cleavage sites have been mapped to KR81A and QR92S. Importantly, GrpEL1 levels are seriously compromised in severe dengue virus-infected clinical samples. Our studies provide novel insights into the import of NS3 into host mitochondria and identify a hitherto unknown factor, GrpEL1, as a cleavage target, thereby providing new avenues for dengue virus research and the design of potential therapeutics.

No safe vaccine is available, there is no experimental animal model and no specific treatment (antiviral) for Dengue virus (DV) infection exists. The pathogenic mechanisms of the severe forms of the disease, such as Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), in which endothelial damage is the pathognomonic sign, are not fully understood. Clinical observations have revealed significant abnormalities in the coagulation and inflammation systems, with increased levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) in the plasma of patients with DHF/DSS (grade III or IV). Blood sTM was proposed as an early predictor of DSS during the febrile stage. However, the role of the DV in endothelial injury during DSS is unclear. Here, we present novel insights into the participation of DV in the downregulation of the thrombomodulin-thrombin-protein C complex formation at the endothelial surface, with a reduction in activated protein C (APC). APC is the most important vasoprotective protein because it downregulates thrombin generation (by the inactivation of procoagulant factors Va and VIIIa) and has anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and barrier protection properties.

The role of hepatic cells in dengue pathogenesis is not well established, but since hepatocytes are the major source of plasma proteins, changes in protein secretion by these cells during infection might contribute to disease progression. Previously, we showed that DENV infection alters the secretion pattern of hepatic HepG2 cells, with α-enolase appearing as one of the major proteins secreted in higher levels by infected cells. ELISA analysis demonstrated that DENV infection modulates α-enolase secretion in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but has no effect on its gene expression and on the intracellular content of the protein as assessed by PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. Two-dimensional western blots showed that both intracellular and secreted forms of α-enolase appear as five spots, revealing α-enolase isoforms with similar molecular weights but distinct isoeletric points. Remarkably, quantification of each spot content revealed that DENV infection shifts the isoform distribution pattern of secreted α-enolase towards the basic isoforms, whereas the intracellular protein remains unaltered, suggesting that post-translational modifications might be involved in α-enolase secretion by infected cells. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying α-enolase secretion by hepatic cells and its relationship with the role of liver in dengue pathogenesis. In addition, preliminary results obtained with plasma samples from DENV-infected patients suggest an association between plasma levels of α-enolase and disease severity. Since α-enolase binds plasminogen and modulates its activation, it is plausible to speculate the association of the increase in α-enolase secretion by infected hepatic cells with the haemostatic dysfunction observed in dengue patients including the promotion of fibrinolysis and vascular permeability alterations.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying α-enolase secretion by hepatic cells and its relationship with the role of liver in dengue pathogenesis and preliminary results obtained with plasma samples from DENV-infected patients suggest an association between plasma levels of α- enolase and disease severity."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6463,"details":{"paperId":"0fe08080935f7b0816a6c2cb9eb996b8948a52ae","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3960163","MAG":"2014438021","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0092056","CorpusId":"1935149","PubMed":"24647143"},"title":"Molecular Archaeology of Flaviviridae Untranslated Regions: Duplicated RNA Structures in the Replication Enhancer of Flaviviruses and Pestiviruses Emerged via Convergent Evolution","abstract":"RNA secondary structures in the 3′untranslated regions (3′UTR) of the viruses of the family Flaviviridae, previously identified as essential (promoters) or beneficial (enhancers) for replication, have been analysed.

Very little is known about the mechanism of this de novo initiation and how conservation of the starting adenosine is achieved.

The H798 loop residue is of central importance for the ATP-specific initiation step. In addition to ATP selection, NS5PolDV ensures the conservation of the 5′-adenosine by strongly discriminating against viral templates containing an erroneous 3′-end nucleotide in the presence of Mg2+.

Dengue virus NS1 contributes to severe dengue pathology such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak independently of the virus. ABSTRACT Members of the mosquito-borne flavivirus genus such as dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses cause distinct diseases and affect different tissues. We previously found that the secreted flaviviral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) interacts with endothelial cells and disrupts endothelial barrier function in a tissue-specific manner consistent with the disease tropism of the respective viruses. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this tissue-specific NS1-endothelial cell interaction is not well understood. To elucidate the distinct role(s) that the wing and β-ladder domains of NS1 play in NS1 interactions with endothelial cells, we constructed flavivirus NS1 chimeras that exchanged the wing and β-ladder domains in a pairwise manner between DENV, WNV, and ZIKV NS1. We found that both the NS1 wing and β-ladder domains conferred NS1 tissue-specific endothelial dysfunction, with the wing conferring cell binding and the β-ladder involved in inducing endothelial hyperpermeability as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance. To narrow down the amino acids dictating cell binding specificity, we utilized the DENV-WNV NS1 chimera and identified residues 91 to 93 (GDI) of DENV NS1 as a molecular motif determining binding specificity. Further, using an in vivo mouse model of localized leak, we found that the GDI motif of the wing domain was essential for triggering DENV NS1-induced vascular leak in mouse dermis. Taken together, we identify molecular determinants of flavivirus NS1 that confer NS1 binding and vascular leak and highlight the importance of the NS1 wing domain for flavivirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Flavivirus NS1 is secreted into the bloodstream from infected cells during a viral infection. Dengue virus NS1 contributes to severe dengue pathology such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak independently of the virus. We have shown that multiple flavivirus NS1 proteins result in endothelial dysfunction in a tissue-specific manner consistent with their respective viral tropism. Here, we aimed to identify the molecular determinants that make some, but not other, flavivirus NS1 proteins bind to select endothelial cells in vitro and cause vascular leak in a mouse model. We identified the wing domain of NS1 as a primary determinant conferring differential endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak and narrowed the contributing amino acid residues to a three-residue motif within the wing domain.

There are many approaches to begin to define the pathways at work to control viral pathogenesis. The approach favored in this thesis was to conduct a broad screen of the innate immune response at the gene expression level of infected cells. The innate immune response is critical to the control of viral infections. Type I interferons (IFN), IFNα and IFNβ, are antiviral proteins that are an integral part of the innate immune response. Furthermore, by virtue of their effects on maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells, IFNs are a pivotal link between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Most cell types produce type-I IFN when exposed to viruses. However, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to suppress IFN production or signaling. It is imperative to understand the virus-host interaction at the molecular level in order to identify as yet unknown mechanisms of the host antiviral response; these additional pathways may be useful in counteracting the viral suppression of IFN. Type-I IFNs regulate expression of at least five hundred genes, suggesting a complex network of signaling pathways. Depending on the cell type different proteins regulate the induction of IFN or the expression of IFN-inducible genes. Identification of proteins that induce selected IFN-inducible genes may provide synergistic activity with or may have an advantage over type-I IFN for anti-viral therapy in the future. Many diseases are untreatable if identified late in their progression. In resource-limited countries, many diseases are diagnosed clinically, which can lead to incorrect or delayed diagnosis and treatment. The identification of biomarkers of disease has the potential to guide the correct therapy in a timely fashion. The objective of this thesis was to identify novel anti-viral therapies and disease biomarkers for dengue virus (DENV) infection. DENV is a mosquito-borne positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, which causes an estimated 50 million infections annually. Most DENV infections result in a febrile illness called Dengue fever (DF). Less frequently, infections cause Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a potentially fatal vascular leakage syndrome associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. At present patients infected with DENV can only be treated by intravenous fluid support to prevent hypovolemia and hypotensive shock. This treatment is less effective in severe cases if the diagnosis is delayed. Identification of therapeutics with both antiviral and immune-modulatory activity may lower patient mortality and reduce the burden of DENV on society. DENV infection is cleared in most individuals after a short period of viremia {Libraty, 20022225}.

Human retinal cells were inoculated with DENV-2 and monitored for up to 72 hours. Epithelial and endothelial cells supported DENV replication and release, but epithelial cells alone demonstrated clear cytopathic effect, and infection was more productive in those cells.

The causative agent Dengue Virus (DENV) is a positive strand RNA virus replicating predominantly in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The severi-ty of the disease is strongly linked to the level of viral replication, which is de-termined, amongst others by pre-existing DENV-specific antibodies and genetic determinants of the virus and the host. The aim of my thesis was to characterize the role of nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) for the DENV replication cycle. NS5 is a multifunctional protein involved in viral RNA replication, 5’ end capping and blocking of interferon (IFN)-mediated signaling by degrading STAT2. Although DENV replicates in the cytoplasm, NS5 mostly accumulates in the nucleus of infected cells. This study investigated the determinants of NS5 nuclear transport and the effects of nuclear NS5 on viral replication and innate immunity. Nuclear accumulation of NS5 occurred inde-pendent from other viral proteins and was found in infected mammalian and mosquito cells arguing for an evolutionarily conserved property. A mutation analysis was used to identify amino acid residues in NS5 essential for nuclear accumulation. Replication analyses of these nuclear localization signal (NLS) mu-tants showed that even though a high level of nuclear NS5 is not required for efficient DENV replication, complete abrogation of nuclear transport significantly reduced viral replication. Interestingly, the poorly replicating NLS mutants could not be rescued by providing wild type protein in trans indicating that factors other than nuclear NS5 are responsible for their poor replication. To check whether these NLS mutations affect enzymatic activities of NS5, recombinant full length proteins were bacterially expressed and purified. Enzymatic assays showed that save for one, none of the NLS mutations impaired RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or methyl transferase activity. Moreover, IFN sensitivity of the NLS mutants was similar to wild type indicating that nuclear NS5 is not required to counteract IFN induced genes. Contrary to earlier observations no significant difference was observed in induction of interleukin-8 by wild type and mutant NS5. In the second part of my PhD study, I performed a genome-wide RNAi-based kinase screen to identify cellular kinases promoting or restricting DENV replication. An imaging based RNAi screening platform for DENV was developed, which included optimization of siRNA-mediated silencing in human hepatoma cells, viral infection, immunostaining, image acquisition and statistical data analysis. The primary screen was carried out with a kinase library targeting all known and putative cellular kinases with three siRNAs per gene. Approximately 100 kinases selected from the primary screen were validated in an infection based screen with a new siRNA library containing a different set of siRNAs against each gene. The screen identified 18 kinases essential for DENV replication and 15 kinases suppressing viral replication. The kinase siRNAs were later tested in a DENV subgenomic reporter replicon based screen to differentiate their role in viral en-try or replication.

NS5, the largest viral protein, is a key replication enzyme with both methyltransferase and RNA polymerase activities. We present to our knowledge the first crystal structure of the full-length NS5 protein from dengue virus bound to the authentic 5′-end viral RNA fragment. This structure captures the viral enzyme in the act of transferring a methyl group to the 2′-O-ribose of the first nucleotide of the viral genome, providing an atomic-level understanding of specific 2′-O-methylation and cap formation by the flavivirus methyltransferase. The structure also suggests an evolutionary origin for the methyltransferase domain of NS5 and strategies for designing novel antiviral inhibitors. Dengue virus (DENV) causes several hundred million human infections and more than 20,000 deaths annually. Neither an efficacious vaccine conferring immunity against all four circulating serotypes nor specific drugs are currently available to treat this emerging global disease. Capping of the DENV RNA genome is an essential structural modification that protects the RNA from degradation by 5′ exoribonucleases, ensures efficient expression of viral proteins, and allows escape from the host innate immune response. The large flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) (105 kDa) has RNA methyltransferase activities at its N-terminal region, which is responsible for capping the virus RNA genome. The methyl transfer reactions are thought to occur sequentially using the strictly conserved flavivirus 5′ RNA sequence as substrate (GpppAG-RNA), leading to the formation of the 5′ RNA cap: G0pppAG-RNA→m7G0pppAG-RNA (“cap-0”)→m7G0pppAm2′-O-G-RNA (“cap-1”). To elucidate how viral RNA is specifically recognized and methylated, we determined the crystal structure of a ternary complex between the full-length NS5 protein from dengue virus, an octameric cap-0 viral RNA substrate bearing the authentic DENV genomic sequence (5′-m7G0pppA1G2U3U4G5U6U7-3′), and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), the by-product of the methylation reaction. The structure provides for the first time, to our knowledge, a molecular basis for specific adenosine 2′-O-methylation, rationalizes mutagenesis studies targeting the K61-D146-K180-E216 enzymatic tetrad as well as residues lining the RNA binding groove, and offers previously unidentified mechanistic and evolutionary insights into cap-1 formation by NS5, which underlies innate immunity evasion by flaviviruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The first crystal structure of the full-length NS5 protein from dengue virus bound to the authentic 5′-end viral RNA fragment is presented, providing an atomic-level understanding of specific 2′-O-methylation and cap formation by the flavivirus methyltransferase."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6688,"details":{"paperId":"501db65f1e4288e68bbf359de8f3c81fd0c61658","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"6752767","MAG":"2974426760","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1007996","CorpusId":"202702801","PubMed":"31536610"},"title":"Molecular basis of dengue virus serotype 2 morphological switch from 29°C to 37°C","abstract":"The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development.

In the case of dengue virus infection which causes serious public health problems, the mechanisms regarding the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic syndrome are not fully resolved. Our previous studies suggest a mechanism of molecular mimicry in which antibodies directed against dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) cross-react with human platelets and endothelial cells and cause their damage and dysfunction, which may be related to the clinical features of dengue disease. Several cell surface proteins recognized by patient serum samples and anti-NS1 antibodies have been identified. Based on proteomic studies and sequence analysis, the C-terminal region of dengue virus NS1 shows sequence homology with target proteins. In addition, different regions of dengue virus proteins including core, prM, E and NS1 proteins show sequence homology with different coagulatory molecules. As an example, the amino acid sequence 101–106 of E protein (WGNGCG) shows sequence homology with factors XI, X, IX, VII, II (thrombin), plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator. Furthermore, single chain variable region against NS1 can interfere with fibrin formation, which leads to prolonged thrombin time.

Being zoonotic, Flaviviruses infect a wide variety of terrestrial vertebrates, which dependent of the virus-host interactions, can enhance ongoing epidemics and maintain the virus in the environment for prolonged periods. Targeted species can vary from amphibians, birds to various mammals, dependent on the virus. For many mosquito-borne flaviviruses the spectrum of targeted species is incompletely understood, in particular with respect to their contribution to the maintenance of virus in certain geographical regions. Furthermore, little is known about virus and host factors contributing to species tropism. The present study utilized human and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) as a cell culture model to better understand Flavivirus species tropism and innate immune responses. MoDC were selected based on their presence in the skin and their role as an early target cell for several Flaviviruses and their role as immune sentinels. While differences in viral infectivity and replication were minor when comparing porcine with human MoDC for some of the tested Flaviviruses, a particularly strong replication in human MoDC was found with USUV, while JEV appeared to have a stronger tropism for porcine MoDC. With respect to innate immune responses we found high induction of TNF and IFN-β in both human and porcine MoDC after infection with JEV, WNV, and USUV, but not with DENV, ZIKV, and Wesselsbron virus.

In this study, the accumulating evidence of the importance of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the host secretory pathway led us to hypothesize that this moonlighting enzyme could play a key role in the lifecycle steps of two important Flaviviridae members, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dengue virus (DENV). We used short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of human GAPDH in Huh-7.5.1 cells- both pre- and post-HCV infection- to demonstrate that GAPDH is a host factor for HCV infection. siRNA-induced GAPDH knockdown performed pre-HCV infection inhibits HCV core production in infected cells and leads to a decrease in infectivity of the HCV-infected cell supernatants. siRNA-induced GAPDH knockdown performed post-HCV infection does not have an effect on HCV core abundance in infected cells, but does lead to a decrease in infectivity of the HCV-infected cell supernatants. Exogenous expression of V5-tagged human GAPDH, pre- and post-infection, increases the infectivity of HCV-infected cell supernatants, suggesting a role for GAPDH during HCV post-replication steps. Interestingly, siRNA-induced GAPDH knockdown in HCV replicon-harbouring cells had no effect on viral RNA replication. Importantly, we confirmed the important role of GAPDH in the HCV lifecycle using Huh-7-derived stable GAPDH-knockdown clones.

Inoculating mice lacking the interferon-α/β receptor intradermally with DENV revealed that mosquito salivary gland extract (SGE) exacerbates dengue pathogenesis specifically in the presence of enhancing serotype-cross-reactive antibodies—when individuals already carry an increased risk for severe disease. We further establish that SGE increases viral titers in the skin, boosts antibody-enhanced DENV infection of dendritic cells and macrophages in the dermis, and amplifies dendritic cell migration to skin-draining lymph nodes. We demonstrate that SGE directly disrupts endothelial barrier function in vitro and induces endothelial permeability in vivo in the skin. Finally, we show that surgically removing the site of DENV transmission in the skin after 4 hours rescued mice from disease in the absence of SGE, but no longer prevented lethal antibody-enhanced disease when SGE was present.

In the absence of an effective vaccine and therapeutics and with a declining efficacy of insecticide, there is an urgent need to develop novel interventions. Here, we deployed an approach that combines metabolomics with molecular biology in mosquitoes. We revealed that dengue virus reconfigures the endomembrane phospholipids to form the structures required for its replication by activating the phospholipid remodeling cycle. We showed that a blood component that initiates de novo phospholipid production decreases mosquito infection. Overall, we revealed how and why dengue virus reconfigures phospholipids in mosquitoes. This understanding highlights intervention targets. Dengue virus (DENV) subdues cell membranes for its cellular cycle by reconfiguring phospholipids in humans and mosquitoes. Here, we determined how and why DENV reconfigures phospholipids in the mosquito vector. By inhibiting and activating the de novo phospholipid biosynthesis, we demonstrated the antiviral impact of de novo–produced phospholipids. In line with the virus hijacking lipids for its benefit, metabolomics analyses indicated that DENV actively inhibited the de novo phospholipid pathway and instead triggered phospholipid remodeling. We demonstrated the early induction of remodeling during infection by using isotope tracing in mosquito cells. We then confirmed in mosquitoes the antiviral impact of de novo phospholipids by supplementing infectious blood meals with a de novo phospholipid precursor. Eventually, we determined that phospholipid reconfiguration was required for viral genome replication but not for the other steps of the virus cellular cycle. Overall, we now propose that DENV reconfigures phospholipids through the remodeling cycle to modify the endomembrane and facilitate formation of the replication complex.

One of the mammalian kinases responsible for phosphorylation, protein kinase G (PKG), has been implicated in the behavior of multiple nonvector insects, but is unstudied in mosquitoes. PKG from Aedes aegypti was cloned, and phosphorylation of specific viral sites was monitored by mass spectrometry from biochemical and cell culture experiments. PKG from Aedes mosquitoes is able to phosphorylate dengue nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) at specific sites in cell culture and cell-free systems and autophosphorylates its own regulatory domain in a cell-free system. Injecting Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes with a pharmacological PKG activator resulted in increased Aedes wing activity during periods of their natural diurnal/crepuscular activity and increased Anopheles nocturnal locomotor/flight activity. Thus, perturbation of the PKG signaling pathway in mosquitoes alters flight behavior. The demonstrated effect of PKG alterations is consistent with a viral PKG substrate triggering increased PKG activity.

Six NS2A mutants (NM5, -7, -9, and -17 to -19) around pTMS1 and -2 displayed a novel phenotype showing a >1,000-fold reduction in virus yield, an absence of plaque formation despite wild-type-like replicon activity, and infectious-virus-like particle yields. HEK-293 cells infected with the six NS2A mutant viruses failed to cause a virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) by MitoCapture staining, cell proliferation, and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. Sequencing analyses of pseudorevertant viruses derived from lethal-mutant viruses revealed two consensus reversion mutations, leucine to phenylalanine at codon 181 (L181F) within pTMS7 of NS2A and isoleucine to threonine at codon 114 (I114T) within NS2B. The introduction of an NS2A-L181F mutation into the lethal (NM15, -16, -25, and -33) and CPE-defective (NM7, -9, and -19) mutants substantially rescued virus infectivity and virus-induced CPE, respectively, whereas the NS2B-L114T mutation rescued the NM16, -25, and -33 mutants. In conclusion, the results revealed the essential roles of the N-terminal half of NS2A in RNA replication and virus-induced CPE. Intramolecular interactions between pTMSs of NS2A and intermolecular interactions between the NS2A and NS2B proteins were also implicated. IMPORTANCE The characterization of the N-terminal (current study) and C-terminal halves of DENV NS2A is the most comprehensive mutagenesis study to date to investigate the function of NS2A during the flaviviral life cycle. A novel region responsible for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) within pTMS1 and -2 of DENV NS2A was identified. Revertant genetics studies implied unexpected relationships between various pTMSs of DENV NS2A and NS2B. These results provide comprehensive information regarding the functions of DENV NS2A and the specific amino acids and transmembrane segments responsible for these functions. The positions and properties of the rescuing mutations were also revealed, providing important clues regarding the manner in which intramolecular or intermolecular interactions between the pTMSs of NS2A and NS2B regulate virus replication, assembly/secretion, and virus-induced CPE. These results expand the understanding of flavivirus replication. The knowledge may also facilitate studies of pathogenesis and novel vaccine and antiflaviviral drug development.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The introduction of an NS2A-L181F mutation into the lethal and CPE-defective mutants substantially rescued virus infectivity and virus-induced CPE, respectively, whereas the NS2B-L114T mutation rescued the NM16, -25, and -33 mutants."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4879,"details":{"paperId":"d41b8dc80f20a60b0634df8790bf059bbc38e7b3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2099008481","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.00224-12","CorpusId":"206792020","PubMed":"22532681"},"title":"Mutagenesis of the DI/DIII Linker in Dengue Virus Envelope Protein Impairs Viral Particle Assembly","abstract":"ABSTRACT The dengue virus (DV) envelope (E) protein is important in mediating viral entry and assembly of progeny virus during cellular infection.

Although the flexibility of the DI/DIII linker is thought to be important for accommodating the structural rearrangements undergone by the E protein during viral entry, the function of the linker in the DV infectious cycle is not well understood. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on conserved residues in the DI/DIII linker of the DV2 E protein and showed that the resulting mutations had little or no effect on the entry process but greatly affected virus assembly. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments performed on infectious virus as well as in a virus-like particle (VLP) system indicate that the DI/DIII linker mutants express the DV structural proteins at the sites of particle assembly near the ER but fail to form infectious particles. This defect is not due to disruption of E's interaction with prM and pr in immature and mature virions, respectively. Serial passaging of the DV2 mutant E-Y299F led to the identification of a mutation in the membrane-proximal stem region of E that fully compensates for the assembly defect of this DI/DIII linker mutant.

The latter region has seven conserved helicase motifs found in all members of the family Flaviviridae. DEN-2 NS3 lacking the proteinase region was synthesized as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli.

The mutations were also tested for their effects on virus replication by incorporation into genomic-length cDNA. Two mutations, both in motif I (G198A and K199A) abolished both ATPase and helicase activity. Two further mutations, one in motif VI (R457A,R458A) and the other a clustered charged-to-alanine substitution at R376KNGK380, abolished helicase activity only.

In this work, we demonstrated that NS4B is an N-glycosylated protein in virus-infected cells as well as in recombinant protein expression. NS4B is N glycosylated at residues 58 and 62 and exists in two forms, glycosylated and unglycosylated. We manipulated full-length infectious RNA clones and subgenomic replicons to generate N58Q, N62Q, and N58QN62Q mutants. Each of the single mutants had distinct effects, but the N58QN62Q mutation resulted in dramatic reduction of viral production efficiency without affecting secretion or infectivity of the virion in mammalian and mosquito C6/36 hosts. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), subgenomic replicon, and trans-complementation assays indicated that the N58QN62Q mutation affected RNA replication possibly by the loss of glycans. In addition, four intragenic mutations (S59Y, S59F, T66A, and A137T) were obtained from mammalian and/or mosquito C6/36 cell culture systems. All of these second-site mutations compensated for the replication defect of the N58QN62Q mutant without creating novel glycosylation sites.

Functional characterization implied that DENV NS4B utilizes the glycosylation machinery in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. Four intragenic mutations were found to compensate for replication and subsequent viral production deficiencies without creating novel N-glycosylation sites or modulating the stabilities of the protein, suggesting that glycans may be involved in maintaining the NS4B protein conformation. NS4B glycans may be necessary elements of the viral life cycle, but compensatory mutations can circumvent their requirement.

Here, we report that N-glycosylation of the E protein, which is conserved among most flaviviruses, is critical for the Zika virus (ZIKV) to invade the vector midgut by inhibiting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway of the mosquito immune system. Our data further show that removal of the ZIKV E glycosylation site prevents mosquito infection by flaviviruses via the oral route, whereas there is no effect on infection by intrathoracic microinjection, which bypasses the midgut. Interestingly, the defect in infection of the mosquito midgut by the mutant virus through blood feeding is rescued by reduction of the ROS level by application of vitamin C, a well-known antioxidant. Therefore, our data demonstrate that ZIKV utilizes the glycosylation on the envelope to antagonize the vector immune defense during infection. IMPORTANCE Most flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), are transmitted between hosts by arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, which acquire the virus during a blood meal. Here, by mutagenesis, we found a major role of the N-glycosylation of flavivirus E protein in its transmission circle, facilitating its survival against the vector immune system during invasion of the mosquito midgut while blood feeding on the host. In spite of the extensive studies of the involvement of N-glycan modification of flavivirus E protein in virus-host interactions, we discovered its critical role in virus-vector interaction and the evolution of flavivirus.

Dengue virus has a single-stranded RNA genome with positive polarity, a 5′ m7GpppG cap, and a conserved 3′-terminal stem loop (SL) that is linked to proposed functions in viral RNA transcription and translation. Mechanisms explaining the contributions of host proteins to viral RNA translation and replication are poorly defined, yet understanding host protein-viral RNA interactions may identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. This study was directed at identifying functionally significant host proteins that bind the conserved dengue virus RNA 3′ terminus. Methodology/Principal Findings Proteins eluted from a dengue 3′ SL RNA affinity column at increasing ionic strength included two with double-strand RNA binding motifs (NF90/DRBP76 and DEAH box polypeptide 9/RNA helicase A (RHA)), in addition to NF45, which forms a heterodimer with NF90. Although detectable NF90 and RHA proteins localized to the nucleus of uninfected cells, immunofluorescence revealed cytoplasmic NF90 in dengue virus-infected cells, leading us to hypothesize that NF90 has a functional role(s) in dengue infections. Cells depleted of NF90 were used to quantify viral RNA transcript levels and production of infectious dengue virus. NF90 depletion was accompanied by a 50%-70% decrease in dengue RNA levels and in production of infectious viral progeny. Conclusions/Significance The results indicate that NF90 interacts with the 3′ SL structure of the dengue RNA and is a positive regulator of dengue virus replication.

We show that the NK-activating receptor NKp44 is involved in virally mediated NK activation through direct interaction with the flavivirus envelope protein. Recombinant NKp44 directly binds to purified DV and WNV envelope proteins and specifically to domain III of WNV envelope protein; it also binds to WNV virus-like particles.

Results: An unlinked protease complex containing the NS2B regulatory region and the NS3 protease domain was obtained. Conclusion: The unlinked protease complex produces dispersed cross-peaks in NMR spectra and exists predominantly in a closed conformation in solution. Significance: This new construct will be a useful tool for drug discovery against the dengue virus. The dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen responsible for an estimated 100 million human infections annually. The viral genome encodes a two-component trypsin-like protease that contains the cofactor region from the nonstructural protein NS2B and the protease domain from NS3 (NS3pro). The NS2B-NS3pro complex plays a crucial role in viral maturation and has been identified as a potential drug target. Using a DENV protease construct containing NS2B covalently linked to NS3pro via a Gly4-Ser-Gly4 linker (“linked protease”), previous x-ray crystal structures show that the C-terminal fragment of NS2B is remote from NS3pro and exists in an open state in the absence of an inhibitor; however, in the presence of an inhibitor, NS2B complexes with NS3pro to form a closed state. This linked enzyme produced NMR spectra with severe signal overlap and line broadening. To obtain a protease construct with a resolved NMR spectrum, we expressed and purified an unlinked protease complex containing a 50-residue segment of the NS2B cofactor region and NS3pro without the glycine linker using a coexpression system. This unlinked protease complex was catalytically active at neutral pH in the absence of glycerol and produced dispersed cross-peaks in a 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum that enabled us to conduct backbone assignments using conventional techniques. In addition, titration with an active-site peptide aldehyde inhibitor and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement studies demonstrated that the unlinked DENV protease exists predominantly in a closed conformation in solution.

Previously, due to its “complete insolubility”, the isolated NS3pro could not be experimentally studied and it remains elusive what structure it adopts without NS2B and why NS2B is indispensable. Here as facilitated by our previous discovery, the isolated NS3pro has been surprisingly deciphered by NMR to be the first intrinsically-disordered chymotrypsin-like fold, which exists in a loosely-packed state with non-native long-range interactions as revealed by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). The disordered NS3pro appears to be needed for binding a human host factor to trigger the membrane remodeling. Moreover, we have in vitro refolded the NS3pro in complex with either NS2B (48–100) or the full-length NS2B (1–130) anchored into the LMPC micelle, and the two complexes have similar activities but different dynamics. We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the results revealed that NS2B shows the highest structural fluctuations in the complex, thus providing the dynamic basis for the observation on its conformational exchange between open and closed states. Remarkably, the NS2B cofactor plays a central role in maintaining the correlated motion network required for the catalysis as we previously decoded for the SARS 3CL protease. Indeed, a truncated NS2B (48–100;Δ77–84) with the flexible loop deleted is able to trap the NS2B-NS3pro complex in a highly dynamic and catalytically-impotent state.

Our structure guided mutagenesis revealed that disruption of D290–R387 interaction increases basal ATPase activity presumably as a result of higher conformational flexibility of the ATPase active site. Mutational studies also showed R538 plays a critical role in RNA interactions affecting translocation of viral RNA through dynamic interactions with bases at positions 4 and 5 of the ssRNA. Restriction of backbone flexibility around R538 through mutation of G540 to proline abolishes virus replication, indicating conformational flexibility around residue R538 is necessary for RNA translocation.

These viruses contain an RNA genome, prone to mutations, which enhances their potential to emerge as pathogens. Bamaga virus (BgV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the yellow fever virus group that we have previously shown to be host-restricted in vertebrates and horizontally transmissible by Culex mosquitoes. Here, we aimed to characterise BgV host-restriction and to investigate the mechanisms involved. We showed that BgV could not replicate in a wide range of vertebrate cell lines and animal species. We determined that the mechanisms involved in BgV host-restriction were independent of the type-1 interferon response and RNAse L activity. Using a BgV infectious clone and two chimeric viruses generated as hybrids between BgV and West Nile virus, we demonstrated that BgV host-restriction occurred post-cell entry. Notably, BgV host-restriction was shown to be temperature-dependent, as BgV replicated in all vertebrate cell lines at 34°C but only in a subset at 37°C. Serial passaging of BgV in Vero cells resulted in adaptive mutants capable of efficient replication at 37°C. The identified mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions in NS4A-S124F, NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C, all occurring close to a viral protease cleavage site (NS4A/2K and NS4B/NS5). These mutations were reverse engineered into infectious clones of BgV, which revealed that NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C were sufficient to restore BgV replication in vertebrate cells at 37°C, while NS4A-S124F further increased replication efficiency. When these mutant viruses were injected into immunocompetent mice, alongside BgV and West Nile virus chimeras, infection and neurovirulence were enhanced as determined by clinical scores, seroconversion, micro-neutralisation, viremia, histopathology and immunohistochemistry, confirming the involvement of these residues in the attenuation of BgV.

ABSTRACT Flavivirus nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) contains an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain and a C-terminal polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) domain fused through a 9-amino-acid linker. While the individual NS5 domains are structurally conserved, in the full-length protein, their relative orientations fall into two classes: the NS5 proteins from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) adopt one conformation, while the NS5 protein from dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) adopts another. Here, we report a crystallographic structure of NS5 from DENV2 in a conformation similar to the extended one seen in JEV and ZIKV NS5 crystal structures. Replacement of the DENV2 NS5 linker with DENV1, DENV3, DENV4, JEV, and ZIKV NS5 linkers had modest or minimal effects on in vitro DENV2 MTase and RdRp activities. Heterotypic DENV NS5 linkers attenuated DENV2 replicon growth in cells, while the JEV and ZIKV NS5 linkers abolished replication. Thus, the JEV and ZIKV linkers likely hindered essential DENV2 NS5 interactions with other viral or host proteins within the virus replicative complex. Overall, this work sheds light on the dynamics of the multifunctional flavivirus NS5 protein and its interdomain linker. Targeting the NS5 linker is a possible strategy for producing attenuated flavivirus strains for vaccine design.

As such, viral pathogens have devised multiple mechanisms to antagonize this pathway and thus facilitate infection. Dengue virus (DENV) encodes several proteins (NS2a, NS4a, and NS4b) that have been shown individually to inhibit the IFN response. In addition, DENV infection results in reduced levels of expression of STAT2, which is required for IFN signaling (M. Jones, A. Davidson, L. Hibbert, P. Gruenwald, J. Schlaak, S. Ball, G. R. Foster, and M. Jacobs, J. Virol. 79:5414-5420, 2005). Translation of the DENV genome results in a single polypeptide, which is processed by viral and host proteases into at least 10 separate proteins. To date, no single DENV protein has been implicated in the targeting of STAT2 for decreased levels of expression. We demonstrate here that the polymerase of the virus, NS5, binds to STAT2 and is necessary and sufficient for its reduced level of expression. The decrease in protein level observed requires ubiquitination and proteasome activity, strongly suggesting an active degradation process. Furthermore, we show that the degradation of but not binding to STAT2 is dependent on the expression of the polymerase in the context of a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing for NS5 maturation. Thus, the mature form of NS5, when not expressed as a precursor, was able to bind to STAT2 but was unable to target it for degradation, establishing a unique role for viral polyprotein processing in providing an additional function to a viral polypeptide. Therefore, we have identified both a novel mechanism by which DENV evades the innate immune response and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated here that the polymerase of the virus, NS5, binds to STAT2 and is necessary and sufficient for its reduced level of expression, and it is shown that the degradation of but not binding toSTAT2 is dependent on the expression of the polymer enzyme in the context of a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing for NS5 maturation."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":269,"details":{"paperId":"1801825bdb35c4ffe6fab58c85456e1297ab29e6","externalIds":{"MAG":"1984529355","DOI":"10.1006/VIRO.1999.9683","CorpusId":"39666634","PubMed":"10329573"},"title":"Nascent flavivirus RNA colocalized in situ with double-stranded RNA in stable replication complexes.","abstract":"Incorporation of bromouridine (BrU) into viral RNA in Kunjin virus-infected Vero cells treated with actinomycin D was monitored in situ by immunofluorescence using antibodies reactive with Br-RNA.

When cells were labeled with BrU for 15 min, the estimated cycle period for RNA synthesis, the nascent Br-RNA was not digested in permeabilized cells by RNase A under high-salt conditions, in accord with our original model of flavivirus RNA synthesis (Chu, P.

Platelet activation with thrombocytopenia and endothelial dysfunction are prominent features of dengue virus infection. We postulated that dengue infection is associated with NOX-independent NET formation, which is related to platelet activation, endothelial perturbation and increased vascular permeability. Using our specific NET assays, we investigated the time course of NET formation in a cohort of Indonesian dengue patients. We found that plasma levels of NETs were profoundly elevated and that these NETs were predominantly NOX-independent NETs. During early recovery phase (7-13 days from fever onset), total NETs correlated negatively with platelet number and positively with platelet P-selectin expression, the binding of von Willebrand factor to platelets and levels of Syndecan-1. Patients with gall bladder wall thickening, an early marker of plasma leakage, had a higher median level of total NETs.

It is now widely recognized that virtual screening campaigns should consider the flexibility of target protein by using multiple active conformational states. The flexibility of the DENV NS3PRO could explain the relatively low success of previous virtual screening studies. In this first work, we explore the DENV NS3PRO conformational states obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to take into account protease flexibility during the virtual screening/docking process. To do so, we built a full NS3PRO model by multiple template homology modeling. The model comprised the NS2B cofactor (essential to the NS3PRO activation), a glycine flexible link and the proteolytic domain. MD simulations had the purpose to sample, as closely as possible, the ligand binding site conformational landscape prior to inhibitor binding. The obtained conformational MD sample was clustered into four families that, together with principal component analysis of the trajectory, demonstrated protein flexibility.

The interaction between nitric oxide and dengue virus in such target cell is unknown. In this report, the impact of nitric oxide on infectious dengue virus serotype 2 production and RNA replication was investigated in vitro. Primary isolates of dengue virus serotype 2 from dengue patients were replicated in mouse neuroblastoma cells in the presence of an exogenous nitric oxide donor, s‐nitroso‐N‐acethylpennicillamine, SNAP, at the concentration of 50 or 75 or 100 μM. Nitric oxide inhibited viral replication in a dose and a multiplicity of infection dependent manner. Nitric oxide from 50 and 75 μM SNAP delayed and suppressed replication of dengue virus isolates while higher concentration of nitric oxide, 100 μM SNAP, completely inhibited production of infectious particles up to 36 hr study. Twenty‐four out of forty tested isolates, 60%, were susceptible to 50 μM SNAP inhibitory effect. The mechanism of inhibition was investigated at the level of RNA synthesis and was found that RNA production was suppressed which correlated to production of the infectious particles. Down‐regulation of the RNA synthesis resulted in reduction of protein synthesis which was detected by lower level of NS1 protein synthesis using immunoblotting. In conclusion, nitric oxide from exogenous nitric oxide donor down regulated replication of dengue virus serotype 2 isolates from dengue patients. The suppression was clearly shown at the level of viral RNA and protein synthesis resulting in reduction of viral progenies production.

WNV and DENV actively replicate in mosquitoes and human hosts and thus encounter different host immune responses. RNA interference (RNAi) is the predominant antiviral response against invading RNA viruses in insects and plants. As a countermeasure, plant and insect RNA viruses encode RNA silencing suppressor (RSS) proteins to block the generation/activity of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Enhanced flavivirus replication in mosquitoes depleted for RNAi factors suggests an important biological role for RNAi in restricting virus replication, but it has remained unclear whether or not flaviviruses counteract RNAi via expression of an RSS. First, we established that flaviviral RNA replication suppressed siRNA-induced gene silencing in WNV and DENV replicon-expressing cells. Next, we showed that none of the WNV encoded proteins displayed RSS activity in mammalian and insect cells and in plants by using robust RNAi suppressor assays. In contrast, we found that the 3′-untranslated region-derived RNA molecule known as subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) efficiently suppressed siRNA- and miRNA-induced RNAi pathways in both mammalian and insect cells.

Flaviviruses produce an abundant noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells. sfRNA results from stalling of the host 5′-3′ exoribonuclease XRN1/Pacman on conserved RNA structures in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genomic RNA. sfRNA production is conserved in insect-specific, mosquito-borne, and tick-borne flaviviruses and flaviviruses with no known vector, suggesting a pivotal role for sfRNA in the flavivirus life cycle. Here, we investigated the function of sfRNA during WNV infection of Culex pipiens mosquitoes and evaluated its role in determining vector competence. An sfRNA1-deficient WNV was generated that displayed growth kinetics similar to those of wild-type WNV in both RNA interference (RNAi)-competent and -compromised mosquito cell lines. Small-RNA deep sequencing of WNV-infected mosquitoes indicated an active small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based antiviral response for both the wild-type and sfRNA1-deficient viruses. Additionally, we provide the first evidence that sfRNA is an RNAi substrate in vivo. Two reproducible small-RNA hot spots within the 3′ UTR/sfRNA of the wild-type virus mapped to RNA stem-loops SL-III and 3′ SL, which stick out of the three-dimensional (3D) sfRNA structure model. Importantly, we demonstrate that sfRNA-deficient WNV displays significantly decreased infection and transmission rates in vivo when administered via the blood meal. Finally, we show that transmission and infection rates are not affected by sfRNA after intrathoracic injection, thereby identifying sfRNA as a key driver to overcome the mosquito midgut infection barrier. This is the first report to describe a key biological function of sfRNA for flavivirus infection of the arthropod vector, providing an explanation for the strict conservation of sfRNA production. IMPORTANCE Understanding the flavivirus transmission cycle is important to identify novel targets to interfere with disease and to aid development of virus control strategies. Flaviviruses produce an abundant noncoding viral RNA called sfRNA in both arthropod and mammalian cells. To evaluate the role of sfRNA in flavivirus transmission, we infected mosquitoes with the flavivirus West Nile virus and an sfRNA-deficient mutant West Nile virus. We demonstrate that sfRNA determines the infection and transmission rates of West Nile virus in Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Comparison of infection via the blood meal versus intrathoracic injection, which bypasses the midgut, revealed that sfRNA is important to overcome the mosquito midgut barrier. We also show that sfRNA is processed by the antiviral RNA interference machinery in mosquitoes. This is the first report to describe a pivotal biological function of sfRNA in arthropods.

Secondary and tertiary RNA structures present in the viral genome are crucial for viral replication. Here, we used the NS3 protein from dengue virus to investigate functions of NS3 associated to changes in RNA structures. Using different NS3 variants, we characterized a domain spanning residues 171 to 618 that displays ATPase and RNA unwinding activities similar to those observed for the full-length protein. Interestingly, we found that, besides the RNA unwinding activity, dengue virus NS3 greatly accelerates annealing of complementary RNA strands with viral or non-viral sequences. This new activity was found to be ATP-independent. It was determined that a mutated NS3 lacking ATPase activity retained full-RNA annealing activity. Using an ATP regeneration system and different ATP concentrations, we observed that NS3 establishes an ATP-dependent steady state between RNA unwinding and annealing, allowing modulation of the two opposing activities of this enzyme through ATP concentration.

DENV replication occurs in the cytoplasm; however, a high proportion of nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), containing methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities, accumulates in the nuclei of infected cells. The present study investigates the impact of nuclear localization of NS5 on its known functions, including viral RNA replication and subversion of the type I interferon response. By using a mutation analysis approach, we identified the most critical residues within the αβ nuclear localization signal (αβNLS), which are essential for the nuclear accumulation of this protein. Although we observed an overall correlation between reduced nuclear accumulation of NS5 and impaired RNA replication, we identified one mutant with drastically reduced amounts of nuclear NS5 and virtually unaffected RNA replication, arguing that nuclear localization of NS5 does not correlate strictly with DENV replication, at least in cell culture. Because NS5 plays an important role in blocking interferon signaling via STAT-2 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 2) degradation, the abilities of the NLS mutants to block this pathway were investigated. All mutants were able to degrade STAT-2, with accordingly similar type I interferon resistance phenotypes. Since the NLS is contained within the RdRp domain, the MTase and RdRp activities of the mutants were determined by using recombinant full-length NS5. We found that the C-terminal region of the αβNLS is a critical functional element of the RdRp domain required for polymerase activity.

DENV non-structural protein 5 (NS5) plays a central role in this disruption, such as antagonism of STAT2. We recently found that DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) NS5 interacts with Polymerase associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C). The primary members of PAF1C are PAF1, LEO1, CTR9 and CDC73. This nuclear complex is an emerging player in the immune response. It promotes the expression of many genes, including genes related to the antiviral, antimicrobial and inflammatory responses, through close association with the chromatin of these genes. Our previous work demonstrated that NS5 antagonizes PAF1C recruitment to immune response genes. However, it remains unknown if NS5 antagonism of PAF1C is complementary to its antagonism of STAT2. Here, we show that knockout of PAF1 enhances DENV2 infectious virion production. By comparing gene expression profiles in PAF1 and STAT2 knockout cells, we find that PAF1 is necessary to express immune response genes that are STAT2-independent. Finally, we mapped the viral determinants for the NS5-PAF1C protein interaction. We found that NS5 nuclear localization and the C-terminal region of the methyltransferase domain are required for its interaction with PAF1C. Mutation of these regions rescued the expression of PAF1-dependent immune response genes that are antagonized by NS5. In sum, our results support a role for PAF1C in restricting DENV2 replication that NS5 antagonizes through its protein interaction with PAF1C. Author summary Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen that infects nearly 400 million people a year and thus represents a major challenge for public health. Productive infection by DENV relies on the effective evasion of intrinsic antiviral defenses and is often accomplished through virus-host protein interactions. Here, we investigate the recently discovered interaction between DENV non-structural protein 5 (NS5) and the transcriptional regulator Polymerase associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C). Our work demonstrates PAF1C member PAF1 acts as an antiviral factor and inhibits DENV replication. In parallel, we identified immune response genes involved in intrinsic antiviral defense that depend on PAF1 for expression. We further identified the regions of NS5 required for the protein interaction with PAF1C. Breaking the NS5-PAF1C protein interaction restores the expression of PAF1-dependent immune response genes. Together, our work establishes the antiviral role of PAF1C in DENV infection and NS5 antagonism of PAF1-dependent gene expression through a virus-host protein interaction.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results support a role for PAF1C in restricting DENV2 replication that NS5 antagonizes through its protein interaction with PAf1C, and establishes the antiviral role of PAF 1C in DENV infection and NS 5 antagonism ofPAF1-dependent gene expression through a virus-host protein interaction."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4092,"details":{"paperId":"5935b7c2735cd055d7aeb8ad216fa558cdfb5b43","externalIds":{"MAG":"2098697013","DOI":"10.1099/0022-1317-73-11-2999","CorpusId":"38011940","PubMed":"1279106"},"title":"Nuclear localization of dengue 2 virus core protein detected with monoclonal antibodies.","abstract":"Anti-dengue 2 virus core protein monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reacted with antigens in the cytoplasm and in, or on, the nucleus of dengue 2 and dengue 4, but not dengue 1, dengue 3, Kunjin or Murray Valley encephalitis virus-infected cells.

Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed no differences in viral RNA or protein levels at early time points postinfection, suggesting a role for NCL in viral morphogenesis.

OBJECTIVE To determine the role of miR-484 and miR-744 in DENV infection and to examine whether DENV infection alters the expression of both miRNAs. METHODS We used bioinformatics tools to explore the relationship between DENV and cellular miRNAs. We then overexpressed miR-484 or miR-744 in Vero cells to examine their role in DENV replication using flow cytometry, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blotting. FINDINGS We found several cellular miRNAs that target a conserved region within the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the genome of the four DENV serotypes and found that overexpression of miR-484 or miR-744 inhibits infection by DENV-1 to DENV-4. Furthermore, we observed that DENV RNA might be involved in the downregulation of endogenous miR-484 and miR-744.

This study aimed to see how mosquito cells can survive the infection during prosperous replication of the virus. In C6/36 cells, global protein translation was shut down after infection by DENV type 2 (DENV2). However, it returned to a normal level when infected cells were treated with an inhibitor of the protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathway. Based on a 7-Methylguanosine 5′-triphosphate (m7GTP) pull-down assay, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex was also identified in DENV2-infected cells. This suggests that most mosquito proteins are synthesized via canonical cap-dependent translation. When the PERK signal pathway was inhibited, both accumulation of reactive oxygen species and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential increased. This suggested that ER stress response was alleviated through the PERK-mediated shutdown of global proteins in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. In the meantime, the activities of caspases-9 and -3 and the apoptosis-related cell death rate increased in C6/36 cells with PERK inhibition. This reflected that the PERK-signaling pathway is involved in determining cell survival, presumably by reducing DENV2-induced ER stress. Looking at the PERK downstream target, α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), an increased phosphorylation status was only shown in infected C6/36 cells. This indicated that recruitment of ribosome binding to the mRNA 5′-cap structure could have been impaired in cap-dependent translation. It turned out that shutdown of cellular protein translation resulted in a pro-survival effect on mosquito cells in response to DENV2 infection. As synthesis of viral proteins was not affected by the PERK signal pathway, an alternate mode other than cap-dependent translation may be utilized. This finding provides insights into elucidating how the PERK signal pathway modulates dynamic translation of proteins and helps mosquito cells survive continuous replication of the DENV2. It was ecologically important for virus amplification in mosquitoes and transmission to humans.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It turned out that shutdown of cellular protein translation resulted in a pro-survival effect on mosquito cells in response to DENV2 infection, providing insights into elucidating how the PERK signal pathway modulates dynamic translation of proteins and helps mosquito cells survive continuous replication of theDENV2."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7837,"details":{"paperId":"faba9c31266fb464ef21e69efd7d700250bea503","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7150897","MAG":"3011476475","DOI":"10.3390/v12030328","CorpusId":"214600973","PubMed":"32197325"},"title":"PERK-Mediated Unfolded Protein Response Signaling Restricts Replication of the Tick-Borne Flavivirus Langat Virus","abstract":"The unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains protein-folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has been implicated as both beneficial and detrimental to flavivirus infection. Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), a sensor of the UPR, is commonly associated with antiviral effects during mosquito-borne flavivirus (MBFV) infection, but its relation to tick-borne flavivirus (TBFV) infection remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified changes in UPR and autophagic activity during Langat virus (LGTV) infection. LGTV robustly activated UPR and altered autophagic flux. Knockdown of endogenous PERK in human cells resulted in increased LGTV replication, but not that of closely related Powassan virus (POWV). Finally, on examining changes in protein levels of components associated with UPR and autophagy in the absence of PERK, we could show that LGTV-infected cells induced UPR but did not lead to expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), an important downstream transcription factor of multiple stress pathways. From these data, we hypothesize that LGTV can antagonize other kinases that target eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), but not PERK, implicating PERK as a potential mediator of intrinsic immunity.

The ISR is activated downstream of p-eIF2α during infection with either virus, but translation arrest only occurred following DENV infection.

Flavivirus envelope proteins are N-glycosylated surface proteins, which interact with C-type lectins, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) through their glycans. In this review, we discuss both host and viral surface receptors that have the carbohydrate components, focusing on the surface interactions in the early stage of flavivirus entry. GAG-flavivirus envelope protein interactions as well as interactions between flavivirus envelope proteins and DC-SIGN are discussed in detail. This review also examines natural and synthetic inhibitors of flaviviruses that are carbohydrate-based or carbohydrate-targeting. Both advantages and drawbacks of these inhibitors are explored, as are potential strategies to improve their efficacy to ultimately help eradicate flavivirus infections.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review examines natural and synthetic inhibitors of flaviviruses that are carbohydrate-based or carbohydrate-targeting, as well as potential strategies to improve their efficacy and help eradicate flavivirus infections."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4661,"details":{"paperId":"272587589e0138de1fbddc14e8459fed2513f627","externalIds":{"MAG":"2018750823","DOI":"10.1126/SCIENCE.3277268","CorpusId":"22321811","PubMed":"3277268"},"title":"Pathogenesis of dengue: challenges to molecular biology.","abstract":"Dengue viruses occur as four antigenically related but distinct serotypes transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.

This severe syndrome, which recently has also been identified in children infected with the virus in Puerto Rico, is characterized by increased vascular permeability and abnormal hemostasis. It occurs in infants less than 1 year of age born to dengue-immune mothers and in children 1 year and older who are immune to one serotype of dengue virus and are experiencing infection with a second serotype. Dengue viruses replicate in cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and subneutralizing concentrations of dengue antibody enhance dengue virus infection in these cells. This antibody-dependent enhancement of infection regulates dengue disease in human beings, although disease severity may also be controlled genetically, possibly by permitting and restricting the growth of virus in monocytes. Monoclonal antibodies show heterogeneous distribution of antigenic epitopes on dengue viruses. These epitopes serve to regulate disease: when antibodies to shared antigens partially neutralize heterotypic virus, infection and disease are dampened; enhancing antibodies alone result in heightened disease response.

In this review, we focus on the possible pathogenic effects of a pleiotropic cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), on the pathogenesis of DENV infection. MIF is a critical mediator of the host immune response and inflammation, and there is a correlation between the serum levels of MIF and disease severity in dengue patients. Furthermore, MIF knock-out mice exhibit less severe clinical disease and lethality. However, the role of MIF in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not limited to immune cell recruitment. Recent evidence indicates that DENV infection induced MIF production and may contribute to vascular hyperpermeability and viral replication during DENV infection. The expression of both adhesion and coagulation molecules on MIF-stimulated monocytes and endothelial cells is also increased, which may contribute to inflammatory and anticoagulatory states during DHF/DSS.

Analogous to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, the NS5 polymerase initiates RNA synthesis through a de novo mechanism and then makes a transition to a processive elongation phase. However, whether and how the MTase affects polymerase activities through intramolecular interactions remain elusive. By solving the crystal structure of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS5, we recently identified an MTase-RdRP interface containing a set of six hydrophobic residues highly conserved among flaviviruses. To dissect the functional relevance of this interface, we made a series of JEV NS5 constructs with mutations of these hydrophobic residues and/or with the N-terminal first 261 residues and other residues up to the first 303 residues deleted. Compared to the wild-type (WT) NS5, full-length NS5 variants exhibited consistent up- or downregulation of the initiation activities in two types of polymerase assays. Five representative full-length NS5 constructs were then tested in an elongation assay, from which the apparent single-nucleotide incorporation rate constant was estimated. Interestingly, two constructs exhibited different elongation kinetics from the WT NS5, with an effect rather opposite to what was observed at initiation. Moreover, constructs with MTase and/or the linker region (residues 266 to 275) removed still retained polymerase activities, albeit at overall lower levels. However, further removal of the N-terminal extension (residues 276 to 303) abolished regular template-directed synthesis. Together, our data showed that the MTase-RdRP interface is relevant in both polymerase initiation and elongation, likely with different regulation mechanisms in these two major phases of RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE The flavivirus NS5 is very unique in having a methyltransferase (MTase) placed on the immediate N terminus of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). We recently solved the crystal structure of the full-length NS5, which revealed a conserved interface between MTase and RdRP. Building on this discovery, here we carried out in vitro polymerase assays to address the functional relevance of the interface interactions. By explicitly probing polymerase initiation and elongation activities, we found that perturbation in the MTase-RdRP interface had different impacts on different phases of synthesis, suggesting that the roles and contribution of the interface interactions may change upon phase transitions. By comparing the N-terminal-truncated enzymes with the full-length NS5, we collected data to indicate the indispensability to regular polymerase activities of a region that was functionally unclarified previously. Taken together, we provide biochemical evidence and mechanistic insights for the cross talk between the two enzyme modules of flavivirus NS5.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In vitro polymerase assays found that perturbation in the MTase-RdRP interface had different impacts on different phases of synthesis, suggesting that the roles and contribution of the interface interactions may change upon phase transitions."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7496,"details":{"paperId":"c2a4b60c4285348cbc44c501adc3dbdc4088870b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2804041989","PubMedCentral":"5994796","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2018.01276","CorpusId":"44146048","PubMed":"29915602"},"title":"Perturbation of Intracellular Cholesterol and Fatty Acid Homeostasis During Flavivirus Infections","abstract":"Cellular lipid homeostasis is maintained through an intricately linked array of anabolic and catabolic pathways.

RNA viruses encode the information required for their replication in both their primary sequences and higher-order structures formed when the RNA genome strand folds back on itself, but the extent of higher-order structure has remained unclear. We use a new high-throughput RNA structure probing technology to identify RNA regions with tertiary folds and discover that roughly one-third of the dengue virus RNA genome forms higher-order interactions, many in regions functionally important for replication. This work suggests that tertiary structure elements might be common in large RNAs, and that these regions might contain pockets targetable by small molecules in the design of antiviral therapeutics. RNA virus genomes are efficient and compact carriers of biological information, encoding information required for replication both in their primary sequences and in higher-order RNA structures. However, the ubiquity of RNA elements with higher-order folds—in which helices pack together to form complex 3D structures—and the extent to which these elements affect viral fitness are largely unknown. Here we used single-molecule correlated chemical probing to define secondary and tertiary structures across the RNA genome of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2). Higher-order RNA structures are pervasive and involve more than one-third of nucleotides in the DENV2 genomic RNA. These 3D structures promote a compact overall architecture and contribute to viral fitness. Disrupting RNA regions with higher-order structures leads to stable, nonreverting mutants and could guide the development of vaccines based on attenuated RNA viruses.

Silencing of PTB expression inhibited virus translation and replication, whilst overexpression of PTB augmented these processes. Thus, these results provide evidence that, during infection, PTB moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and plays an important role in the DENV replicative cycle.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results provide evidence that, during infection, PTB moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and plays an important role in the DENV replicative cycle."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":900,"details":{"paperId":"a7a1f27c8c00bcf9200017a5abfcf5424c48d5db","externalIds":{"MAG":"2008404247","DOI":"10.1016/0042-6822(89)90383-8","CorpusId":"11291831","PubMed":"2541547"},"title":"Positive identification of NS4A, the last of the hypothetical nonstructural proteins of flaviviruses.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A radiolabeled protein migrating in SDS-polyacrylamide gels near the core protein C of Kunjin virus-infected cells was isolated and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing, establishing its identity as NS4A with a calculated Mr 16,100."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4187,"details":{"paperId":"3efdd1d6188912112a4d7583b14cbb23699dd6cc","externalIds":{"MAG":"2132898662","DOI":"10.1099/vir.0.000097","CorpusId":"22417272","PubMed":"25711963"},"title":"Post-translational regulation and modifications of flavivirus structural proteins.","abstract":"Flaviviruses are a group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that generally circulate between arthropod vectors and susceptible vertebrate hosts, producing significant human and veterinary disease burdens. Intensive research efforts have broadened our scientific understanding of the replication cycles of these viruses and have revealed several elegant and tightly co-ordinated post-translational modifications that regulate the activity of viral proteins. The three structural proteins in particular - capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) - are subjected to strict regulatory modifications as they progress from translation through virus particle assembly and egress. The timing of proteolytic cleavage events at the C-prM junction directly influences the degree of genomic RNA packaging into nascent virions. Proteolytic maturation of prM by host furin during Golgi transit facilitates rearrangement of the E proteins at the virion surface, exposing the fusion loop and thus increasing particle infectivity. Specific interactions between the prM and E proteins are also important for particle assembly, as prM acts as a chaperone, facilitating correct conformational folding of E. It is only once prM/E heterodimers form that these proteins can be secreted efficiently. The addition of branched glycans to the prM and E proteins during virion transit also plays a key role in modulating the rate of secretion, pH sensitivity and infectivity of flavivirus particles. The insights gained from research into post-translational regulation of structural proteins are beginning to be applied in the rational design of improved flavivirus vaccine candidates and make attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The insights gained from research into post-translational regulation of structural proteins are beginning to be applied in the rational design of improved flavivirus vaccine candidates and make attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5181,"details":{"paperId":"d80f7a168043266482625758dec6ab48e8580045","externalIds":{"MAG":"1912434761","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.69.12.8123-8126.1995","CorpusId":"1205435","PubMed":"7494334"},"title":"Posttranslational signal peptidase cleavage at the flavivirus C-prM junction in vitro","abstract":"We have investigated the cleavages at the flavivirus capsid-prM protein junction in vitro.

In this study, we demonstrated that type 2 dengue (DEN-2) virus infection induced extensive apoptosis in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was activated by DEN-2 infection, which led to the generation of arachidonic acid (AA). Inhibition of PLA2 activity by the PLA2inhibitors, AACOCF3 and ONO-RS-082, diminished DEN-2 virus-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the cyclooxygenase inhibitors aspirin and indomethacin, thought to increase AA accumulation by blocking AA catabolism, enhanced apoptosis. Exogenous AA induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Superoxide anion, which is thought to be generated through the AA-activated NADPH oxidase, was increased after infection. Pretreatment with superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected cells against DEN-2 virus-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, generation of superoxide anion was blocked by AACOCF3. In addition, the transcription factors, NF-κB and c-Jun, were found to be activated after DEN-2 virus infection. However, pretreatment of cells with oligodeoxynucleotides containing NF-κB, but not c-Jun, binding sites (transcription factor decoy) strongly prevented dengue virus-induced apoptosis. The finding that AACOCF3 and SOD significantly block activation of NF-κB suggests that this activation is derived from the AA-superoxide anion pathway. Our results indicate that DEN-2 virus infection of human neuroblastoma cells triggers an apoptotic pathway through PLA2 activation to superoxide anion generation and subsequently to NF-κB activation.

The precise molecular mechanisms leading to microvascular leakage are yet to be determined, but dengue virus (DENV) infection and consequent endothelial cell death has been suggested as its major cause. However, the extent of endothelial cell permissiveness to DENV infection and the magnitude of cell death following DENV infection are controversial. To clarify this issue, we analyzed the kinetics and consequences of DENV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using a novel molecularly cloned DENV2‐16681 virus. Viral replication was detected as early as 24 hr post‐infection by RT‐PCR and plaque assays. However, merely 2% of HUVEC were DENV antigen‐positive even after 96 hr of infection as measured by the FACS indirect immunofluorescence assays. Unlike monocytes/macrophages, HUVEC did not support antibody dependent enhancement of dengue viral infection due to a lack of FcγRI and FcγRII. Furthermore, DENV infection did not increase HUVEC apoptosis as compared to mock‐infected cells.

Curiously, studies have shown that infectious DENV titers peak and decrease thereafter in the midgut despite relatively stable viral genome levels. However, the mechanisms that regulate this decoupling of infectious virion production from viral RNA replication have never been determined. We show here that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) plays an important role in regulating infectious DENV production.

Furthermore, this decoupling effect could also be observed after RNAi knockdown in the head/thorax of the mosquito, which otherwise showed direct correlation between infectious DENV titer and viral RNA levels. The dependence on the UPP for successful DENV production is further reinforced by the observed up-regulation of key UPP molecules upon DENV infection that overcome the relatively low expression of these genes after a blood meal.

The endothelial cell lining of the vasculature regulates capillary permeability and is altered by immune and chemokine responses which affect fluid barrier functions of the endothelium. Our findings indicate that human endothelial cells are highly susceptible to infection by dengue virus (type 4). We found that dengue virus productively infects ∼80% of primary human endothelial cells, resulting in the rapid release of ∼105 virions 1 day postinfection. Analysis of potential inhibitors of dengue virus entry demonstrated that antibodies and ligands to integrins and cellular receptors were unable to inhibit dengue virus infection of endothelial cells. In contrast, pretreating cells with heparin or heparan sulfate resulted in a 60 to 80% reduction in dengue virus-infected cells, and pretreatment of endothelial cells with heparinase III or protease reduced dengue infectivity by >80%. Dengue virus bound specifically to resin immobilized heparin, and binding was competitively inhibited by excess heparin but not other ligands.

Usage of host proteins by viruses can have severe consequences e.g. apoptosis, metabolic disequilibria, or altered cell proliferation and mobility. Understanding protein interactions during virus infection can thus educate us on viral infection and pathogenesis mechanisms. Moreover, it has led to important clinical translations, including the development of new therapeutic and vaccination strategies.

Mass spectrometry was used to compare the phosphorylation sites of the NS5 proteins of yellow fever virus (YFV) and dengue virus (DENV), two flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes. Seven DENV phosphopeptides were identified, but only one conserved phosphoacceptor site (threonine 449 in DENV) was identified in both viruses. This site is predicted to be a protein kinase G (PKG) recognition site and is a strictly conserved serine/threonine phosphoacceptor site in mosquito-borne flaviviruses. In contrast, in tick-borne flaviviruses, this residue is typically a histidine. A DENV replicon engineered to have the tick-specific histidine residue at this position is replication defective. We show that DENV NS5 purified from Escherichia coli is a substrate for PKG in vitro and facilitates the autophosphorylation of PKG as seen with cellular substrates.

Currently, no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against dengue virus is available. Innate immunity has been shown to be important for host resistance to DENV infection. Although protein kinase regulated by double-stranded RNA (PKR) has been found to promote the innate signaling in response to infection by several viruses, its role in the innate response to DENV infection is still unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the role of PKR in DENV-induced innate immune responses. Methodology/Principal Findings By RNAi, silencing of PKR significantly enhanced the expression of interferon (IFN)-β in DENV infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy data showed that PKR knockdown upregulated the activation of innate signaling cascades including p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), interferon regulatory factor-3 and NF-κB, following DENV2 infection. Likewise, a negative regulatory effect of PKR on the IFN production was also observed in poly(IC) challenged cells. Moreover, the PKR knockdown-mediated IFN induction was attenuated by RIG-I or IPS-1 silencing. Finally, overexpression of a catalytically inactive PKR mutant (K296R), but not of a mutant lacking dsRNA binding activity (K64E) or the double mutant (K64EK296R), reversed the IFN induction mediated by PKR knockdown, suggesting that the dsRNA binding activity is required for PKR to downregulate IFN production. Conclusions/Significance PKR acts as a negative regulator of IFN induction triggered by DENVs and poly(IC), and this regulation relies on its dsRNA binding activity.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for dengue disease, a major human health concern for which no effective treatment is available. DENV relies heavily on the host cellular machinery for productive infection. Here, we show that the scaffold protein RACK1, which is part of the DENV replication complex, mediates infection by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. Mass spectrometry analysis of RACK1 partners coupled to an RNA interference screen-identified Vigilin and SERBP1 as DENV host-dependency factors. Both are RNA-binding proteins that interact with the DENV genome. Genetic ablation of Vigilin or SERBP1 rendered cells poorly susceptible to DENV, as well as related flaviviruses, by hampering the translation and replication steps. Finally, we established that a Vigilin or SERBP1 mutant lacking RACK1 binding but still interacting with the viral RNA is unable to mediate DENV infection. We propose that RACK1 recruits Vigilin and SERBP1, linking the DENV genome to the translation machinery for efficient infection.

ABSTRACT Virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules containing a triphosphate group at the 5′ end are natural ligands of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). The cellular pathways and proteins induced by RIG-I are an essential part of the innate immune response against viral infections. Starting from a previously published RNA scaffold (3p10L), we characterized an optimized small dsRNA hairpin (called 3p10LG9, 25 nucleotides [nt] in length) as a highly efficient RIG-I activator. Dengue virus (DENV) infection in cell lines and primary human skin cells could be prevented and restricted through 3p10LG9-mediated activation of RIG‐I. This antiviral effect was RIG-I and interferon signal dependent. The effect was temporary and was reversed above a saturating concentration of RIG-I ligand. This finding revealed an effective feedback loop that controls potentially damaging inflammatory effects of the RIG-I response, at least in immune cells. Our results show that the small RIG-I activator 3p10LG9 can confer short-term protection against DENV and can be further explored as an antiviral treatment in humans.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) utilizes host factors throughout its life cycle. In this study, we identified RNA helicase A (RHA), a member of the DEAD/H helicase family, as an important host factor of DENV. In response to DENV2 infection, nuclear RHA protein was partially redistributed into the cytoplasm. The short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RHA significantly reduced the amounts of infectious viral particles in various cells. The RHA knockdown reduced the multistep viral growth of DENV2 and Japanese encephalitis virus but not Zika virus. Further study showed that the absence of RHA resulted in a reduction of both viral RNA and protein levels, and the data obtained from the reporter replicon assay indicated that RHA does not directly promote viral protein synthesis. RHA bound to the DENV RNA and associated with three nonstructural proteins, including NS1, NS2B3, and NS4B. Further study showed that different domains of RHA mediated its interaction with these viral proteins. The expression of RHA or RHA-K417R mutant protein lacking ATPase/helicase activity in RHA-knockdown cells successfully restored DENV2 replication levels, suggesting that the helicase activity of RHA is dispensable for its proviral effect.

The current study revealed that RHA relocalized into the cytoplasm upon DENV infection and associated with viral RNA and nonstructural proteins, implying that RHA was actively engaged in the viral life cycle. We further provide evidence that RHA promoted the viral yields of DENV2 independent of its helicase activity. These findings demonstrated that RHA is a new host factor required for DENV replication and might serve as a target for antiviral drugs.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"RNA helicase A (RHA), a member of the DEAD/H helicase family, is identified as an important host factor of DENV and might serve as a target for antiviral agents."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6397,"details":{"paperId":"3215d3af184eba3593c278db39ae980da8e39720","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3311579","MAG":"2059602019","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0034060","CorpusId":"2794214","PubMed":"22457813"},"title":"RNA Interference Mediated Inhibition of Dengue Virus Multiplication and Entry in HepG2 Cells","abstract":"Background Dengue virus-host cell interaction initiates when the virus binds to the attachment receptors followed by endocytic internalization of the virus particle. Successful entry into the cell is necessary for infection initiation. Currently, there is no protective vaccine or antiviral treatment for dengue infection. Targeting the viral entry pathway has become an attractive therapeutic strategy to block infection. This study aimed to investigate the effect of silencing the GRP78 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis on dengue virus entry and multiplication into HepG2 cells. Methodology/Principal Findings HepG2 cells were transfected using specific siRNAs to silence the cellular surface receptor (GRP78) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Gene expression analysis showed a marked down-regulation of the targeted genes (87.2%, 90.3%, and 87.8% for GRP78, CLTC, and DNM2 respectively) in transfected HepG2 cells when measured by RT-qPCR. Intracellular and extracellular viral RNA loads were quantified by RT-qPCR to investigate the effect of silencing the attachment receptor and clathrin-mediated endocytosis on dengue virus entry. Silenced cells showed a significant reduction of intracellular (92.4%) and extracellular viral RNA load (71.4%) compared to non-silenced cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed a marked reduction of infected cells (89.7%) in silenced HepG2 cells compared to non-silenced cells. Furthermore, the ability to generate infectious virions using the plaque assay was reduced 1.07 log in silenced HepG2 cells. Conclusions/Significance Silencing the attachment receptor and clathrin-mediated endocytosis using siRNA could inhibit dengue virus entry and multiplication into HepG2 cells. This leads to reduction of infected cells as well as the viral load, which might function as a unique and promising therapeutic agent for attenuating dengue infection and prevent the development of dengue fever to the severe life-threatening DHF or DSS. Furthermore, a decrease of viremia in humans can result in the reduction of infected vectors and thus, halt of the transmission cycle.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Silencing the attachment receptor and clathrin-mediated endocytosis using siRNA could inhibit dengue virus entry and multiplication into HepG2 cells, which leads to reduction of infected cells as well as the viral load, which might function as a unique and promising therapeutic agent for attenuating d Dengue infection."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5326,"details":{"paperId":"fa0f17fc79d8675fafbdfef4fac2918033725db3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2119289230","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.80.5.2170-2182.2006","CorpusId":"19533100","PubMed":"16474125"},"title":"RNA Secondary Structure in the Coding Region of Dengue Virus Type 2 Directs Translation Start Codon Selection and Is Required for Viral Replication","abstract":"ABSTRACT Dengue virus is a positive-strand RNA virus and a member of the genus Flavivirus, which includes West Nile, yellow fever, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Flavivirus genomes are translated as a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into 10 proteins, the first of which is the viral capsid (C) protein. Dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) and other mosquito-borne flaviviruses initiate translation of C from a start codon in a suboptimal context and have multiple in-frame AUGs downstream. Here, we show that an RNA hairpin structure in the capsid coding region (cHP) directs translation start site selection in human and mosquito cells. The ability of the cHP to direct initiation from the first start codon is proportional to its thermodynamic stability, is position dependent, and is sequence independent, consistent with a mechanism in which the scanning initiation complex stalls momentarily over the first AUG as it begins to unwind the cHP. The cHP of tick-borne flaviviruses is not maintained in a position to influence start codon selection, which suggests that this coding region cis element may serve another function in the flavivirus life cycle. Here, we demonstrate that the DENV2 cHP and both the first and second AUGs of C are necessary for efficient viral replication in human and mosquito cells.

Mast cells are tissue-resident innate immune cells that play a sentinel cell role in host protection against infectious agents via pathogen-recognition receptors by producing potent mediators that modulate inflammation, cell recruitment and normal vascular homeostasis. Most importantly, mast cells are susceptible to antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection and respond with selective cytokine and chemokine responses. In order to obtain a global view of dengue virus-induced gene regulation in mast cells, primary human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs) and the KU812 and HMC-1 mast cell lines were infected with dengue virus in the presence of dengue-immune sera and their responses were evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels. Mast cells responded to antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection or polyinosiniċpolycytidylic acid treatment with the production of type I interferons and the rapid and potent production of chemokines including CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL10. Multiple interferon-stimulated genes were also upregulated as well as mRNA and protein for the RNA sensors PKR, RIG-I and MDA5. Dengue virus-induced chemokine production by KU812 cells was significantly modulated by siRNA knockdown of RIG-I and PKR, in a negative and positive manner, respectively. Pretreatment of fresh KU812 cells with supernatants from dengue virus-infected mast cells provided protection from subsequent infection with dengue virus in a type I interferon-dependent manner.

We have recently shown that flaviviruses produce a unique, small, noncoding RNA (∼0.5 kb) derived from the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the genomic RNA (gRNA), which is required for flavivirus-induced cytopathicity and pathogenicity (G. P. Pijlman et al., Cell Host Microbe, 4: 579-591, 2008). This RNA (subgenomic flavivirus RNA [sfRNA]) is a product of incomplete degradation of gRNA presumably by the cellular 5′-3′ exoribonuclease XRN1, which stalls on the rigid secondary structure stem-loop II (SL-II) located at the beginning of the 3′ UTR. Mutations or deletions of various secondary structures in the 3′ UTR resulted in the loss of full-length sfRNA (sfRNA1) and production of smaller and less abundant sfRNAs (sfRNA2 and sfRNA3). Here, we investigated in detail the importance of West Nile virus Kunjin (WNVKUN) 3′ UTR secondary structures as well as tertiary interactions for sfRNA formation. We show that secondary structures SL-IV and dumbbell 1 (DB1) downstream of SL-II are able to prevent further degradation of gRNA when the SL-II structure is deleted, leading to production of sfRNA2 and sfRNA3, respectively. We also show that a number of pseudoknot (PK) interactions, in particular PK1 stabilizing SL-II and PK3 stabilizing DB1, are required for protection of gRNA from nuclease degradation and production of sfRNA.

In order to understand how these viruses replicate in human cells, we previously conducted genome-scale RNA interference screens to identify candidate host factors. In these screens, we identified ribosomal proteins RPLP1 and RPLP2 (RPLP1/2) to be among the most crucial putative host factors required for DENV and YFV infection. RPLP1/2 are phosphoproteins that bind the ribosome through interaction with another ribosomal protein, RPLP0, to form a structure termed the ribosomal stalk. RPLP1/2 were validated as essential host factors for DENV, YFV, and ZIKV infection in two human cell lines: A549 lung adenocarcinoma and HuH-7 hepatoma cells, and for productive DENV infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Depletion of RPLP1/2 caused moderate cell-line-specific effects on global protein synthesis, as determined by metabolic labeling. In A549 cells, global translation was increased, while in HuH-7 cells it was reduced, albeit both of these effects were modest. In contrast, RPLP1/2 knockdown strongly reduced early DENV protein accumulation, suggesting a requirement for RPLP1/2 in viral translation. Furthermore, knockdown of RPLP1/2 reduced levels of DENV structural proteins expressed from an exogenous transgene. We postulate that these ribosomal proteins are required for efficient translation elongation through the viral open reading frame. In summary, this work identifies RPLP1/2 as critical flaviviral host factors required for translation. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses cause important diseases in humans. Examples of mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses include dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Viruses require a plethora of cellular factors to infect cells, and the ribosome plays an essential role in all viral infections. The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine composed of RNA and proteins and it is responsible for protein synthesis. We identified two specific ribosomal proteins that are strictly required for flavivirus infection of human cells and mosquitoes: RPLP1 and RPLP2 (RPLP1/2).

The Rab18 protein, a member of the Rab GTPase family, key regulators of membrane trafficking, is located on the organelles involved in DENV infection, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs). In this study, we addressed the potential involvement of Rab18 in DENV infection by using cells overexpressing the wild-type, GTP-bound active form, or GDP-bound inactive form of Rab18 and cells with Rab18 knockdown. DENV replication, measured by viral protein, viral RNA, and viral progeny production, as well as LD induction, was reduced in cells with inactive Rab18 and in cells deprived of Rab18 expression, suggesting a positive role of Rab18 in the DENV life cycle. Interestingly, the interaction of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key lipogenic enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, with DENV NS3 protein relied on the conversion of the GDP-bound to the GTP-bound form of Rab18. Furthermore, the targeting of FASN to sites participating in DENV infection, such as the ER and LDs, depends on functional Rab18. Thus, Rab18-mediated membrane trafficking of FASN and NS3 facilitates DENV replication, probably by ensuring a sufficient and coordinated lipid supply for membrane proliferation and arrangement. IMPORTANCE Infection by dengue virus (DENV), an important mosquito-borne virus threatening ∼40% of the world's population, can cause mild dengue fever or severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The pathogenesis mechanisms of DENV-related diseases are not clear, but high viral replication is believed to be a risk factor for the severe form of DENV infection. Thus, understanding the detailed mechanism of DENV replication might help address this devastating virus. Here, we found that Rab18, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking and located in the endoplasmic reticulum network and on the surfaces of lipid droplets, positively regulates DENV replication. The functional machinery of Rab18 is required to recruit the enzyme fatty acid synthase to sites of DENV replication and to interact with DENV NS3 protein to promote fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, DENV usurps Rab18 to facilitate its own replication.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that Rab18, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking and located in the endoplasmic reticulum network and on the surfaces of lipid droplets, positively regulates DENV replication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5533,"details":{"paperId":"4f76f397d89550669a256c57f936e421556d890a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2039289737","DOI":"10.1159/000151531","CorpusId":"46451710","PubMed":"18724065"},"title":"Rab8, a Vesicular Traffic Regulator, Is Involved in Dengue Virus Infection in HepG2 Cells","abstract":"Objective: The pathogenesis of dengue virus (DV) has not been completely clarified.

DENV causes dengue fever, currently the world's fastest-spreading tropical disease. Severe forms of the disease like dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are life-threatening. There is no specific treatment and no anti-DENV vaccines. Our recent data suggests that the amino terminal cytoplasmic region of the dengue virus non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) comprising amino acid residues 1 to 48 forms an amphipathic helix in the presence of membranes. Its amphipathic character was shown to be essential for viral replication. NMR-based structure-function analysis of the NS4A amino terminal region depends on its milligram-scale production and labeling with NMR active isotopes. Methodology/Principal Findings This report describes the optimization of a uniform procedure for the expression and purification of the wild type NS4A(1-48) peptide and a peptide derived from a replication-deficient mutant NS4A(1-48; L6E, M10E) with disrupted amphipathic nature. A codon-optimized, synthetic gene for NS4A(1-48) was expressed as a fusion with a GST-GB1 dual tag in E. coli. Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease mediated cleavage generated NS4A(1-48) peptides without any artificial overhang. Using the described protocol up to 4 milligrams of the wild type or up to 5 milligrams of the mutant peptide were obtained from a one-liter culture. Isotopic labeling of the peptides was achieved and initial NMR spectra were recorded. Conclusions/Significance Small molecules targeting amphipathic helices in the related Hepatitis C virus were shown to inhibit viral replication, representing a new class of antiviral drugs. These findings highlight the need for an efficient procedure that provides large quantities of the amphipathic helix containing NS4A peptides.

Treatment of the purified fusion protein with thrombin released a 68-kDa protein which is the expected molecular mass for the DEN1 NS3 protein. The identity of this protein was confirmed by Western blotting using dengue virus antisera. Two related activities of the recombinant NS3 protein were characterized, which were the binding of the protein to the 3'-noncoding region of the dengue virus RNA genome and NTPase activity. We demonstrated using a band shift assay that the DEN1 NS3 protein could form a complex with the stem-loop structure in the 3'-noncoding region (3'-NCR), although sites outside the stem-loop may also participate in binding. Using various unlabeled homopolymeric and heteropolymeric RNAs as competitors for binding, it was further shown that the DEN1 NS3 protein exhibits preferential binding to a 94-nt RNA transcript from the 3'-NCR of the dengue virus. The NTPase activity of the recombinant DEN1 NS3 protein was characterized using a thin-layer chromatography assay. We found that the DEN1 NS3 protein possesses some aspects of NTPase activity, which are distinct from those found in other flaviviruses. Although the NS3 protein was able to utilize all four ribonucleoside triphosphates as its substrates, the NS3 protein showed a distinct preference for purine triphosphates (i.e., ATP and GTP).

In any given dengue outbreak, a percentage of infected population develops severe clinical manifestations, and this remains one of the “unsolved conundrums in dengue pathogenesis”. Although, host immunity and virus serotypes are known to modulate the infection, there are still certain underlying factors that play important roles in modulating dengue pathogenesis. Advanced genomics-based technologies have led to identification of regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that viruses and their hosts employ non-coding RNAs to modulate the outcome of infection in their own favor.

The viruses that comprise the Flaviviridae family are small enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. The Flaviviridae are divided into three genera of more closely related viruses: Flavivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now the most common cause of liver failure and liver transplantation in the United States and Europe. The ability to sense an invading pathogen is critical to the cell’s ability to respond in an appropriate manner to clear the infection. The cell utilizes a group of proteins known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect the presence of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) within products of viral replication. It is likely that RIG-I primarily detects motifs within the genomes of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DV), and West Nile virus (WNV), as it does with HCV, since Flavivirus genomes are capped and therefore do not present naked 5' ppp motifs as PAMPs. Examination of interferon (IFN) signaling in infected cells has revealed strategies by which Flaviviridae members attenuate IFN-a/β receptor signaling actions, thus limiting the downstream expression of ISGs that otherwise control virus replication and spread.

In this study, we reveal that DENV2 infection increased autophagic activity, glucose uptake, protein levels of glucose transporter‐1 (GLUT1), and glycolysis rate‐limiting enzyme hexokinase‐2 (HK2) in cells. Furthermore, the protein levels of LC3‐II and HK2 were increased in the brain tissues of the DENV2‐infected suckling mice.

Moreover, amiodarone‐induced autophagic activity, glucose uptake, HK2 level, and viral titer were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor spautin‐1 or silencing of Atg5 gene expression. Intriguingly, blocking of glycolysis, HK2 protein level, and viral titer were accordingly decreased, but autophagic activity was increased, suggesting the existence of another regulation mechanism that influences the relationship between glycolysis and autophagy.

Kunjin virus (KUN) NS2A is a small, hydrophobic, transmembrane protein that is part of the replication complex and inhibits interferon induction. Previously, we have shown that an isoleucine (I)-to-asparagine (N) substitution at position 59 of the NS2A protein blocked the production of secreted virus particles in cells electroporated with viral RNA carrying this mutation. We now show that prolonged incubation of mutant KUN NS2A-I59N replicon RNA, in an inducible BHK-derived packaging cell line (expressing KUN structural proteins C, prM, and E), generated escape mutants that rescued the secretion of infectious virus-like particles. Sequencing identified three groups of revertants that included (i) reversions to wild-type, hydrophobic Ile, (ii) pseudorevertants to more hydrophobic residues (Ser, Thr, and Tyr) at codon 59, and (iii) pseudorevertants retaining Asn at NS2A codon 59 but containing a compensatory mutation (Thr-to-Pro) at NS2A codon 149. Engineering hydrophobic residues at NS2A position 59 or the compensatory T149P mutation into NS2A-I59N replicon RNA restored the assembly of secreted virus-like particles in packaging cells. T149P mutation also rescued virus production when introduced into the full-length KUN RNA containing an NS2A-I59N mutation. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy analyses of NS2A-I59N replicon-expressing cells showed a distinct lack of virus-induced membranes normally present in cells expressing wild-type replicon RNA. The compensatory mutation NS2A-T149P restored the induction of membrane structures to a level similar to those observed during wild-type replication.

Platelets also interact with Monocytes and Neutrophils and facilitate their activation to release different cytokines which further enhances inflammation. Upon activation, platelets also secrete factors such as CXCL4 (also known as platelet factor, PF4), CCL5 and fibrinopeptides which are critical regulators of replication and propagation of several viruses in the host.

Dengue virus infection of Huh 7 cells decreased the mRNA levels of host RNAi factors, namely, Dicer, Drosha, Ago1, and Ago2, and in corollary, silencing of these genes in virus-infected cells enhanced dengue virus replication.

Research on the cellular host factors involved in the control of the replication of these viruses is urgently needed in order to better understand their pathogenesis and to provide potential therapeutic targets. Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that aids in the degradation of cellular components in vesicles known as autophagosomes during stress conditions, such as viral infection. First, we investigated the role of proteins involved in autophagy (ATG proteins) in the replication of DENV and CHIKV in human cell lines. We found that ATG proteins differentially modulate the replication of these viruses. Even more, we identified a protein, e.g., BNIP3, which regulates CHIKV infection via mechanisms independent of the functions that have been described in the literature so far. We showed that depletion of BNIP3 favours CHIKV at an early stage in the replication cycle, resulting in higher infectivity and viral production. Next we also investigated the changes that occur in the expression of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), in macrophages infected with DENV.

However, viruses, being small in size, can only harbor a genome large enough to code for the minimal number of proteins required for the replication and maturation of the virions. As a result, many viral proteins are multifunctional machines that do not directly obey the classic structure-function paradigm. Often, such multifunctionality is rooted in intrinsic disorder that allows viral proteins to interact with various cellular factors and remain functional in the hostile environment of different cellular compartments. Areas covered This report covers the classification of flaviviruses, their proteome organization, and the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in the proteomes of different flaviviruses. Further, we have summarized the speculations made about the apparent roles of intrinsic disorder in the observed multifunctionality of flaviviral proteins.

The ability of dengue virus to infect the endothelium provides a direct means for dengue to alter capillary permeability, permit virus replication, and induce responses that recruit immune cells to the endothelium.

Here, we report that during infection the virus employs ESCRT protein members for virus replication and assembly. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are usually transmitted to humans via mosquito or tick bites. During infection, virus replication and assembly, whose cellular sites are relatively close, are controlled by virus proteins and a diverse range of host proteins. By siRNA-mediated gene silencing, we showed that ALIX and CHMP4A, two members of the host endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) protein machinery, are required during flavivirus infection. Using cell lines expressing subgenomic replicons and replicon virus-like particles, we demonstrated specific roles for ALIX and CHMP4A in viral replication and assembly, respectively. Employing biochemical and imaging methodology, we showed that the ESCRT proteins are recruited by a putative specific late (L) domain motif LYXLA within the NS3 protein of tick-borne flaviviruses. Furthermore, to counteract the recruitment of ESCRT proteins, the host cells may elicit defense mechanisms. We found that ectopic expression of the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) or the E3 ISG15-protein ligase (HERC5) reduced virus replication by suppressing the positive effects of ALIX and CHMP4A. Collectively, these results have provided new insights into flavivirus-host cell interactions that function as checkpoints, including the NS3 and the ESCRT proteins, the ISG15 and the ESCRT proteins, at essential stages of the virus life cycle. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses are important zoonotic viruses with high fatality rates worldwide. Here, we report that during infection, the virus employs members of ESCRT proteins for virus replication and assembly. Among the ESCRT proteins, ALIX acts during virus replication, while CHMP4A is required during virus assembly. Another important ESCRT protein, TSG101, is not required for virus production. The ESCRT, complex, ALIX-CHMP4A, is recruited to NS3 through their interactions with the putative L domain motif of NS3, while CHMP4A is recruited to E. In addition, we demonstrate the antiviral mechanism of ISG15 and HERC5, which degrades ALIX and CHIMP4A, indirectly targets virus infection. In summary, we reveal host-dependency factors supporting flavivirus infection, but these factors may also be targeted by antiviral host effector mechanisms.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that during infection, the virus employs members of ESCRT proteins for virus replication and assembly, and the antiviral mechanism of ISG15 and HERC5, which degrades ALIX and CHMP4A, indirectly targets virus infection."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7893,"details":{"paperId":"fbbb8140e1f9459b1d95c66fdffc686e9802ea28","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8538649","DOI":"10.3390/v13102077","CorpusId":"239275861","PubMed":"34696510"},"title":"Roles of Non-Structural Protein 4A in Flavivirus Infection","abstract":"Infections with viruses in the genus Flavivirus are a worldwide public health problem.

Rho-family GTPase Rac1 is a significant element of endothelial barrier function regulation and has been implicated in the regulation of actin remodeling and intercellular junction formation. Yet there is little evidence linking Rac1 GTPase to alteration in endothelial cell function induced by DV infection. Methods and Findings Here, we showed that actin is essential for DV serotype 2 (DV2) entry into and release from ECV304 cells, and Rac1 signaling is involved these processes. At early infection, actin cytoskeleton rearranged significantly during 1 hour post infection, and disrupting actin filament dynamics with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D reduced DV2 entry. DV2 entry induced reduction of Rac1 activity within 1 hour post infection. The expression of dominant-negative forms of Rac1 established that DV2 entry is negatively regulated by Rac1. At late infection, actin drugs also inhibited the DV2 release and induced accumulation of viral proteins in the cytoplasm. Meanwhile, the activity of Rac1 increased significantly with the progression of DV2 infection and was up-regulated in transfected cells expressing E protein. Confocal microscopy showed that DV2 E protein was closely associated with either actin or Rac1 in DV2-infected cells. The interaction between E protein and actin was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay.

Thus, LNP may have roles in the generation or maintenance of the Ve during flavivirus infection.

High viral loads correlate with disease severity, and both type I & II interferons (IFNs) are crucial for controlling viral replication. We have previously reported that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1-deficient mice are resistant to DENV-induced disease, but little is known about this STAT1-independent mechanism of protection. To determine the molecular basis of the STAT1-independent pathway, mice lacking STAT1, STAT2, or both STAT1 and STAT2 were infected with a virulent mouse-adapted strain of DENV2. In the first 72 hours of infection, the single-deficient mice lacking STAT1 or STAT2 possessed 50–100 fold higher levels of viral RNA than wild type mice in the serum, spleen, and other visceral tissues, but remained resistant to DENV-induced death. In contrast, the double-deficient mice exhibited the early death phenotype previously observed in type I and II IFN receptor knockout mice (AG129), indicating that STAT2 is the mediator of the STAT1-independent host defense mechanism. Further studies demonstrated that this STAT2-dependent STAT1-independent mechanism requires the type I IFN receptor, and contributes to the autocrine amplification of type I IFN expression. Examination of gene expression in the spleen and bone marrow-derived macrophages following DENV infection revealed STAT2-dependent pathways can induce the transcription of a subset of interferon stimulated genes even in the absence of STAT1.

WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and IL-4, but not GM-CSF, signaling. However, other related flaviviruses, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain, did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV showed differential inhibition of Jak kinases upstream of STAT5, suggesting divergent countermeasures to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert antiviral immune responses in human DCs. ABSTRACT Flaviviruses are a diverse group of arthropod-borne viruses responsible for numerous significant public health threats; therefore, understanding the interactions between these viruses and the human immune response remains vital. West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infect human dendritic cells (DCs) and can block antiviral immune responses in DCs. Previously, we used mRNA sequencing and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to define molecular signatures of antiviral DC responses following activation of innate immune signaling (RIG-I, MDA5, or type I interferon [IFN] signaling) or infection with WNV. Using this approach, we found that several genes involved in T cell cosignaling and antigen processing were not enriched in DCs during WNV infection. Using cis-regulatory sequence analysis, STAT5 was identified as a regulator of DC activation and immune responses downstream of innate immune signaling that was not activated during either WNV or ZIKV infection. Mechanistically, WNV and ZIKV actively blocked STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of RIG-I, IFN-β, and interleukin-4 (IL-4), but not granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), signaling. Unexpectedly, dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1 to DENV4) and the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain (YFV-17D) did not antagonize STAT5 phosphorylation. In contrast to WNV, ZIKV inhibited JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation following type I IFN treatment, suggesting divergent mechanisms used by these viruses to inhibit STAT5 activation. Combined, these findings identify STAT5 as a target of antagonism by specific pathogenic flaviviruses to subvert the immune response in infected DCs.

However, the roles of viral protein SUMOylation in dengue virus (DENV) infection have not been elucidated. In this study, we found that the SUMOylation pathway was involved in the DENV life cycle, since DENV replication was reduced by silencing the cellular gene Ubc9, which encodes the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for SUMOylation. By in vivo and in vitro SUMOylation assays, the DENV NS5 protein was identified as an authentic SUMO-targeted protein. By expressing various NS5 mutants, we found that the SUMO acceptor sites are located in the N-terminal domain of NS5 and that a putative SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of this domain is crucial for its SUMOylation. A DENV replicon harboring the SUMOylation-defective SIM mutant showed a severe defect in viral RNA replication, supporting the notion that NS5 SUMOylation is required for DENV replication. SUMOylation-defective mutants also failed to suppress the induction of STAT2-mediated host antiviral interferon signaling. Furthermore, the SUMOylation of NS5 significantly increased the stability of NS5 protein, which could account for most of the biological functions of SUMOylated NS5. Collectively, these findings suggest that the SUMOylation of DENV NS5 is one of the mechanisms regulating DENV replication. IMPORTANCE SUMOylation is a common posttranslational modification that regulates cellular protein functions but has not been reported in the proteins of dengue virus. Here, we found that the replicase of DENV, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), can be SUMOylated. It is well known that providing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and antagonizing host antiviral IFN signaling are a “double indemnity” of NS5 to support DENV replication. Without SUMOylation, NS5 fails to maintain its protein stability, which consequently disrupts its function in viral RNA replication and innate immunity antagonism. DENV threatens billions of people worldwide, but no licensed vaccine or specific therapeutics are currently available.

When these processes were performed without elution and with a 10–207 mM sodium phosphate buffer gradient elution, dengue viruses that were adsorbed to HAp were disproportionately located in the columns. However, when eluted with a 10–600 mM sodium phosphate buffer gradient, few viruses were observed on the HAp surface.

These results suggested that dengue virus was adsorbed to the HAp surface by electronic interactions and could be eluted by high-salt concentration buffers, which are commonly used in protein purification.

NS2A has been shown to participate in RNA replication, virion assembly, and the host antiviral response. However, the role of the amino acid residues within the pTMS regions of NS2A during the virus life cycle is poorly understood. In the study described here, we explored the function of DENV NS2A by introducing a series of double or triple alanine substitutions into the C-terminal half (pTMS4 to pTMS8) of NS2A in the context of a DENV infectious clone or subgenomic replicon. Fourteen (8 within pTMS8) of 35 NS2A mutants displayed a lethal phenotype due to impairment of RNA replication by a replicon assay. Three NS2A mutants with mutations within pTMS7, the CM20, CM25, and CM27 mutants, displayed similar phenotypes, low virus yields (>100-fold reduction), wild-type-like replicon activity, and low infectious virus-like particle yields by transient trans-packaging experiments, suggesting a defect in virus assembly and secretion. The sequencing of revertant viruses derived from CM20, CM25, and CM27 mutant viruses revealed a consensus reversion mutation, leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F), at codon 181 within pTMS7. The introduction of an L181F mutation into a full-length NS2A mutant, i.e., the CM20, CM25, and CM27 constructs, completely restored wild-type infectivity. Notably, L181F also substantially rescued the other severely RNA replication-defective mutants with mutations within pTMS4, pTMS6, and pTMS8, i.e., the CM2, CM3, CM13, CM31, and CM32 mutants. In conclusion, the results revealed the essential roles of pTMS4 to pTMS8 of NS2A in RNA replication and/or virus assembly and secretion. The intramolecular interaction between pTMS7 and pTMS4, pTMS6, or pTMS8 of the NS2A protein was also implicated. IMPORTANCE The reported characterization of the C-terminal half of dengue virus NS2A is the first comprehensive mutagenesis study to investigate the function of flavivirus NS2A involved in the steps of the virus life cycle. In particular, detailed mapping of the amino acid residues within the predicted transmembrane segments (pTMSs) of NS2A involved in RNA replication and/or virus assembly and secretion was performed.

However, replication of single-stranded negative RNA viruses was not affected. Specifically, Slfn11 decreases the infectivity of WNV potentially by preventing virus-induced modifications of the host tRNA repertoire that could lead to enhanced viral protein folding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Slfn11 is not the limiting factor of this novel broad antiviral pathway. ABSTRACT Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) is an interferon-stimulated gene that controls the synthesis of proteins by regulating tRNA abundance. Likely through this mechanism, Slfn11 has previously been shown to impair human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the expression of codon-biased open reading frames. Because replication of positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] viruses requires the immediate translation of the incoming viral genome, whereas negative-sense single-stranded RNA [(−)ssRNA] viruses carry at infection an RNA replicase that makes multiple translation-competent copies of the incoming viral genome, we reasoned that (+)ssRNA viruses will be more sensitive to the effect of Slfn11 on protein synthesis than (−)ssRNA viruses. To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested the effects of Slfn11 on the replication of a panel of ssRNA viruses in the human glioblastoma cell line A172, which naturally expresses Slfn11. Depletion of Slfn11 significantly increased the replication of (+)ssRNA viruses from the Flavivirus genus, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), but had no significant effect on the replication of the (−)ssRNA viruses vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Rhabdoviridae family) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Phenuiviridae family). Quantification of the ratio of genome-containing viral particles to PFU indicated that Slfn11 impairs WNV infectivity. Intriguingly, Slfn11 prevented WNV-induced downregulation of a subset of tRNAs implicated in the translation of 11.8% of the viral polyprotein. Low-abundance tRNAs might promote optimal protein folding and enhance viral infectivity, as previously reported. In summary, this study demonstrates that Slfn11 restricts flavivirus replication by impairing viral infectivity.

The ER-resident NS1 is known to be involved in viral genome replication, but the essential roles of secretory NS1 in the virus life cycle are not fully understood.

By using the recombinant flaviviruses carrying the identified NS1 mutation, we clarified that the mutant flaviviruses employed viral genome replication. We then constructed a recombinant NS1 with the identified mutation and demonstrated by physicochemical assays that the mutant NS1 was unable to form a proper oligomer or associate with liposomes. Finally, we showed that the functions of NS1 that were lost by the identified mutation could be compensated for by the in trans-expression of Erns of pestiviruses and host exchangeable apolipoproteins, which participate in the infectious particle formation of pestiviruses and hepaciviruses in the family Flaviviridae, respectively.

Being a key factor in endothelial and tissue-specific modulation, NS1 has been largely studied to understand the molecular mechanisms exploited by the virus to reprogram host cells. A central part of the viral maturation processes is the NS1 oligomerization because many stages rely on these protein-protein assemblies. In the present study, the self-associations of NS1 proteins from Zika, Dengue, and West Nile viruses are examined through constant-pH coarse-grained biophysical simulations. Free energies of interactions were estimated for different oligomeric states and pH conditions. Our results show that these proteins can form both dimers and tetramers under conditions near physiological pH even without the presence of lipids. Moreover, pH plays an important role mainly controlling the regimes where van der Waals interactions govern their association.

Nevertheless, the chemical and biological impact of many host-targeted therapeutics on both the cell and virus has not been elucidated and remains a key complication. Previously, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of fatty acid metabolism has significant antiviral potential. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach to demonstrate how inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis creates a metabolically refractory environment that drives viral dependence on alternate metabolic pathways for survival. By profiling the global metabolic landscape following inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis, we identified additional biochemical pathways that, when inhibited in combination with fatty acid biosynthesis, displayed increased antiviral potential. Our studies also demonstrated that there was a direct link between changes in cellular chemical composition and the ultrastructural membrane architecture induced by viral gene products. Utilizing inhibitors to change these metabolic environments significantly impacted early viral replication and disrupted the membrane architecture critical for the viral life cycle. Here, we have defined at a molecular level how shifting metabolic landscapes can be exploited to identify combinations of therapeutics that have a greater antiviral effect. Author Summary Dengue viruses are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which are prevalent in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. These viruses cause over 350 million infections annually. There are no antivirals to combat infection and the only vaccine available is suboptimal. Since these viruses are obligate pathogens, they hijack lipid metabolic pathways in host cells to drive new lipid synthesis critically required for their replication. Mechanisms of how lipid synthesis impacts viral replication is unknown. These viruses also rearrange cellular membranes to form platforms for assembly of viral replication complexes. Here, for the first time, we show that virus-hijacking of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathways is required for the formation of membranous replication platforms and if inhibited disrupted synthesis of replicative form viral RNA. Importantly, these inhibitors drastically rearranged the metabolic landscape of the cell resulting in an activation of compensatory nucleotide synthesis pathways that allowed the virus to survive at a low level through the inhibition. However, if both pathways were inhibited in combination, infectious virus release was reduced to below detection limits. The study demonstrates how understanding the metabolic landscape altered by specific inhibitors can lead to the discovery of compensatory metabolic pathways and targets that in combination can enhance intervention efficacy.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown for the first time that virus-hijacking of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathways is required for the formation of membranous replication platforms and if inhibited disrupted synthesis of replicative form viral RNA."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4981,"details":{"paperId":"3a95055bef0e0ad7cc3b5504dd30f952e34b07cf","externalIds":{"MAG":"2997943207","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.01175-19","CorpusId":"209677855","PubMed":"31896596"},"title":"Short Direct Repeats in the 3′ Untranslated Region Are Involved in Subgenomic Flaviviral RNA Production","abstract":"Flaviviruses include many important human pathogens.

ABSTRACT Mosquito-borne flaviviruses consist of a positive-sense genome RNA flanked by the untranslated regions (UTRs). There is a panel of highly complex RNA structures in the UTRs with critical functions. For instance, Xrn1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) halt Xrn1 digestion, leading to the production of subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA). Conserved short direct repeats (DRs), also known as conserved sequences (CS) and repeated conserved sequences (RCS), have been identified as being among the RNA elements locating downstream of xrRNAs, but their biological function remains unknown. In this study, we revealed that the specific DRs are involved in the production of specific sfRNAs in both mammalian and mosquito cells. Biochemical assays and structural remodeling demonstrate that the base pairings in the stem of these DRs control sfRNA formation by maintaining the binding affinity of the corresponding xrRNAs to Xrn1. On the basis of these findings, we propose that DRs functions like a bracket holding the Xrn1-xrRNA complex for sfRNA formation. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses include many important human pathogens.

In this study, we used cDNA of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVE) to examine features of the structural polyprotein which allow this regulation of a luminal cleavage by a cytoplasmic protease. We found that the inefficiency of signal peptidase cleavage in the absence of the viral protease is not attributable solely to features of the C protein. Inhibition of cleavage still occurred when charged residues in C were mutated to uncharged residues or when an unrelated protein sequence (that of ubiquitin) was substituted for C. Also, fusion of the C protein did not inhibit processing of an alternative adjacent signal sequence. The cleavage region of the flavivirus prM translocation signal is unusually hydrophobic, and we established that altering this characteristic by making three point mutations near the signal peptidase cleavage site in MVE prM dramatically increased the extent of cleavage without requiring removal of the C protein.

This study exploited a single-virus particle tracking technology to address whether DENV interacts with autophagy machinery during the early stage of infection.

Moreover, single-virus particle tracking revealed that both DENV particles and autophagosomes traveled together during the viral infection. Finally, in the presence of autophagy suppressor 3-methyladenine, the replication of DENV was inhibited and the location of DENV particles spread in cytoplasma. In contrast, the numbers of newly synthesized DENV were elevated and the co-localization of DENV particles and autophagosomes was detected while the cells were treated with autophagy inducer rapamycin.

Viral siRNAs are at the core of the antiviral RNA interference machinery, one of the key pathways that limit virus replication in invertebrates. Besides siRNAs, Aedes mosquitoes and cells derived from these insects produce arbovirus-derived piRNAs, the best studied examples being viruses from the Togaviridae or Bunyaviridae families. Host miRNAs modulate the expression of a large number of genes and their levels may change in response to viral infections. In addition, some viruses, mostly with a DNA genome, express their own miRNAs to regulate host and viral gene expression. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of both viral and host-derived small RNAs in Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells infected with dengue virus 2 (DENV), a member of the Flaviviridae family. Aag2 cells are competent in producing all three types of small RNAs and provide a powerful tool to explore the crosstalk between arboviral infection and the distinct RNA silencing pathways. Interestingly, besides the well-characterized DENV-derived siRNAs, a specific population of viral piRNAs was identified in infected Aag2 cells.

About 20% of infected patients shows a spectrum of clinical manifestation, ranging from a mild flu-like syndrome, to dengue fever, to life-threatening severe dengue diseases, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. ABSTRACT The extent to which viral genomic RNAs interact with host factors and contribute to host response and disease pathogenesis is not well known. Here, we report that the human RNA helicase DDX6 specifically binds to the viral most conserved RNA hairpin in the A3 element in the dengue 3′ UTR, with nanomolar affinities. DDX6 CLIP confirmed the interaction in HuH-7 cells infected by dengue virus serotype 2. This interaction requires three conserved residues—Lys307, Lys367, and Arg369—as well as the unstructured extension in the C-terminal domain of DDX6. Interestingly, alanine substitution of these three basic residues resulted in RNA-independent ATPase activity, suggesting a mechanism by which RNA-binding and ATPase activities are coupled in DEAD box helicases. Furthermore, we applied a cross-omics gene enrichment approach to suggest that DDX6 is functionally related to cell cycle regulation and viral pathogenicity. Indeed, infected cells exhibited cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and a decrease in the early S phase. Exogenous expression of intact DDX6, but not A3-binding-deficient mutants, alleviated these effects by rescue of the DNA preinitiation complex expression. Disruption of the DDX6-binding site was found in dengue and Zika live-attenuated vaccine strains. Our results suggested that dengue virus has evolved an RNA aptamer against DDX6 to alter host cell states and defined DDX6 as a new regulator of G1/S transition. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by mosquitoes to humans, infecting 390 million individuals per year globally. About 20% of infected patients shows a spectrum of clinical manifestation, ranging from a mild flu-like syndrome, to dengue fever, to life-threatening severe dengue diseases, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. There is currently no specific treatment for dengue diseases, and the molecular mechanism underlying dengue pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study, we combined biochemical, bioinformatics, high-content analysis and RNA sequencing approaches to characterize a highly conserved interface of the RNA genome of DENV with a human factor named DDX6 in infected cells.

Here, we identify an invertebrate immune gene in which natural polymorphism is associated with isolate-specific resistance to an RNA virus. Dicer-2 (dcr2) encodes a key protein upstream of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a major antiviral component of innate immunity in invertebrates. We surveyed allelic polymorphism at the dcr2 locus in a wild-type outbred population and in three derived isofemale families of the mosquito Aedes aegypti that were experimentally exposed to several, genetically distinct isolates of dengue virus. We found that dcr2 genotype was associated with resistance to dengue virus in a virus isolate-specific manner. By contrast, no such association was found for genotypes at two control loci flanking dcr2, making it likely that dcr2 contains the yet-unidentified causal polymorphism(s).

Substrate curves for ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP were obtained, and the specificity order for these nucleotides - evaluated as the ratio (kcat/KM)- was GTPATPCTP UTP, which showed that NS3 have poor ability to discriminate between different NTPs. Competition experiments between the four substrates indicated that all of them are hydrolyzed in one and the same catalytic site of the enzyme. The effect of ssRNA on the ATPase activity of NS3 was studied using poly(A) and poly(C). Both RNA molecules produced a 10 fold increase in the turnover rate constant (kcat) and a 100 fold decrease in the apparent affinity (KM) for ATP. When the ratio [RNA bases]/[NS3] was between 0 and 20 the ATPase activity was inhibited by increasing both poly(A) and poly(C).

It is known that cellular cholesterol plays an important role in the life cycle of DENV in human host cells but unknown if the lipid requirements differ for mosquito versus mammalian. In mosquito Aedes aegypti, sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP-2) is critical for cellular cholesterol homeostasis. In this study, we identified SCP-2 as a critical host factor for DENV production in mosquito Aag2 cells. Treatment with a small molecule commonly referred to as SCPI-1, (N-(4-{[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]amino}phenyl)acetamide hydrobromide, a known inhibitor of SCP-2, or knockdown of SCP-2 dramatically repressed the virus production in mosquito but not mammalian cells. We showed that the intracellular cholesterol distribution in mosquito cells was altered by SCP-2 inhibitor treatment, suggesting that SCP-2-mediated cholesterol trafficking pathway is important for DENV viral production. A comparison of the effect of SCP-2 on mosquito and human cells suggests that SCPI-1 treatment decreases cholesterol in both cell lines, but this decrease in cholesterol only leads to a decline in viral titer in mosquito host cells, perhaps, owing to a more drastic effect on perinuclear cholesterol storages in mosquito cells that was absent in human cells.

The flaviviruses encode one methyltransferase, located at the N-terminal portion of the NS5 protein, to catalyze both guanine N-7 and ribose 2′-OH methylations during viral cap formation. Representative flavivirus methyltransferases from dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus (WNV) sequentially generate GpppA → m7GpppA → m7GpppAm. The 2′-O methylation can be uncoupled from the N-7 methylation, since m7GpppA-RNA can be readily methylated to m7GpppAm-RNA. Despite exhibiting two distinct methylation activities, the crystal structure of WNV methyltransferase at 2.8 Å resolution showed a single binding site for S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), the methyl donor. Therefore, substrate GpppA-RNA should be repositioned to accept the N-7 and 2′-O methyl groups from SAM during the sequential reactions. Electrostatic analysis of the WNV methyltransferase structure showed that, adjacent to the SAM-binding pocket, is a highly positively charged surface that could serve as an RNA binding site during cap methylations. Biochemical and mutagenesis analyses show that the N-7 and 2′-O cap methylations require distinct buffer conditions and different side chains within the K61-D146-K182-E218 motif, suggesting that the two reactions use different mechanisms. In the context of complete virus, defects in both methylations are lethal to WNV; however, viruses defective solely in 2′-O methylation are attenuated and can protect mice from later wild-type WNV challenge.

Under acidic pH conditions, the mature virus forms transient fusogenic trimers of E glycoproteins that engage the lipid membrane in host cells to initiate viral fusion and nucleocapsid penetration into the cytoplasm. However, the dynamic nature of the fusogenic trimer has made the determination of its structure a challenge. Here we have used Fab fragments of the neutralizing antibody DV2-E104 to stop the conformational change of dengue virus at an intermediate stage of the fusion process. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that in this intermediate stage, the E glycoproteins form 60 trimers that are similar to the predicted “open” fusogenic trimer. IMPORTANCE The structure of a dengue virus has been captured during the formation of fusogenic trimers. This was accomplished by binding Fab fragments of the neutralizing antibody DV2-E104 to the virus at neutral pH and then decreasing the pH to 5.5. These trimers had an “open” conformation, which is distinct from the “closed” conformation of postfusion trimers. Only two of the three E proteins within each spike are bound by a Fab molecule at domain III. Steric hindrance around the icosahedral 3-fold axes prevents binding of a Fab to the third domain III of each E protein spike. Binding of the DV2-E104 Fab fragments prevents domain III from rotating by about 130° to the postfusion orientation and thus precludes the stem region from “zipping” together the three E proteins along the domain II boundaries into the “closed” postfusion conformation, thus inhibiting fusion.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Fab fragments of the neutralizing antibody DV2-E104 are used to stop the conformational change of dengue virus at an intermediate stage of the fusion process and show that in this intermediate stage, the E glycoproteins form 60 trimers that are similar to the predicted “open” fusogenic trimer."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7283,"details":{"paperId":"73922b24a651ffa4b960f4fab065b5fda5444a42","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8605224","DOI":"10.26508/lsa.202101211","CorpusId":"243861975","PubMed":"34750241"},"title":"Structure of Aedes aegypti procarboxypeptidase B1 and its binding with Dengue virus for controlling infection","abstract":"Using high-resolution structure, we have characterized the substrate specificity of Aedes aegypti procarboxypeptidase B1 and provided mechanistic insights into the binding and inhibition of DENV Metallocarboxypeptidases play critical roles in the development of mosquitoes and influence pathogen/parasite infection of the mosquito midgut.

Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms that facilitate flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), that is produced by all flaviviruses, plays a critical role in ZIKV transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. ZIKV requires sfRNA to overcome the mosquito midgut barrier and efficiently accumulate in the mosquito saliva. We reveal that the mosquito protein ME31B has antiviral activity and specifically binds to sfRNA. These results establish sfRNA as a determinant of ZIKV transmission by mosquitoes and provide mechanistic insights into the functions of this noncoding RNA. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus predominantly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and poses a global human health threat. All flaviviruses, including those that exclusively replicate in mosquitoes, produce a highly abundant, noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells, which implies an important function of sfRNA during mosquito infection. Currently, the role of sfRNA in flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that an sfRNA-deficient ZIKV (ZIKVΔSF1) replicates similar to wild-type ZIKV in mosquito cell culture but is severely attenuated in transmission by Ae. aegypti after an infectious blood meal, with 5% saliva-positive mosquitoes for ZIKVΔSF1 vs. 31% for ZIKV. Furthermore, viral titers in the mosquito saliva were lower for ZIKVΔSF1 as compared to ZIKV. Comparison of mosquito infection via infectious blood meals and intrathoracic injections showed that sfRNA is important for ZIKV to overcome the mosquito midgut barrier and to promote virus accumulation in the saliva. Next-generation sequencing of infected mosquitoes showed that viral small-interfering RNAs were elevated upon ZIKVΔSF1 as compared to ZIKV infection. RNA-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis uncovered that sfRNA specifically interacts with a specific set of Ae. aegypti proteins that are normally associated with RNA turnover and protein translation. The DEAD/H-box helicase ME31B showed the highest affinity for sfRNA and displayed antiviral activity against ZIKV in Ae. aegypti cells. Based on these results, we present a mechanistic model in which sfRNA sequesters ME31B to promote flavivirus replication and virion production to facilitate transmission by mosquitoes.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Comparison of mosquito infection via infectious blood meals and intrathoracic injections showed that sfRNA is important for ZIKV to overcome the mosquito midgut barrier and to promote virus accumulation in the saliva, and mechanistic insights into the functions of this noncoding RNA are provided."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5194,"details":{"paperId":"5c5ddebd61b8423f940c24bc85a361eef25cf8d3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2161387440","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.71.2.1497-1505.1997","CorpusId":"5877185","PubMed":"8995675"},"title":"Subgenomic replicons of the flavivirus Kunjin: construction and applications","abstract":"Several Kunjin virus (KUN) subgenomic replicons containing large deletions in the structural region (C-prM-E) and in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the genome have been constructed.

A further deletion from C20rep of 53 nucleotides, reducing the coding sequence in core protein to two codons (C2rep RNA), resulted in abolishment of RNA replication. Replicon deltaME/76 with a deletion of 76 nucleotides in the 3'UTR of deltaME RNA (nucleotides 10423 to 10498) replicated efficiently, whereas replicon deltaME/352 with a larger deletion of 352 nucleotides (nucleotides 10423 to 10774), including two conserved sequences RCS3 and CS3, was significantly inhibited in RNA replication. To explore the possibility of using a reporter gene assay to monitor synthesis of the positive strand and the negative strand of KUN RNA, we inserted a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene into the 3'UTR of deltaME/76 RNA under control of the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) of encephalomyelocarditis virus RNA in both plus (deltaME/76CAT[+])- and minus (deltaME/76CAT[-])-sense orientations. Although insertion of the IRES-CAT cassette in the plus-sense orientation resulted in a significant (10- to 20-fold) reduction of RNA replication compared to that of the parental deltaME/76 RNA, CAT expression was readily detected in electroporated BHK cells. No CAT expression was detected after electroporation of RNA containing the IRES-CAT cassette inserted in the minus-sense orientation despite its apparently more efficient replication (similar to that of deltaME/76 RNA); this result indicated that KUN negative-strand RNA was probably not released from its template after synthesis.

Here, a full-length, infectious cDNA clone of MVE was constructed and employed to systematically investigate the impact of single amino acid changes at Asp390 on cell tropism, virus entry, and virulence. Each of 10 different E protein 390 mutants was viable. Three mutants (Gly390, Ala390, and His390) showed pronounced differences from an infectious clone-derived control virus in growth in mammalian and mosquito cells. The altered cell tropism correlated with (i) a difference in entry kinetics, (ii) an increased dependence on glycosaminoglycans (determined by inhibition of virus infectivity by heparin) for attachment of the three mutants to different mammalian cells, and (iii) the loss of virulence in mice. These results confirm a functional role of the FG loop in the flavivirus E protein in virus entry and suggest that encephalitic flaviviruses can enter cells via attachment to glycosaminoglycans.

Flaviviruses are largely transmitted by mosquito bites and humans are usually incidental, dead-end hosts, with the notable exceptions of YFV, DENV and ZIKV. Infection by flaviviruses elicits cellular responses including cell death via necrosis, pyroptosis (involving inflammation) or apoptosis (which avoids inflammation).

In this study, we explored the possible involvement of the pelo protein, that is involved in protein translation, in Wolbachia-mediated antiviral response and mosquito-DENV interaction. We found that pelo is upregulated during DENV replication and its silencing leads to reduced DENV virion production suggesting that it facilities DENV replication.

In this study, a reductionist approach was applied, in which C57B/6J mice were inoculated with recombinant DENV-envelope protein domain III (DENV-EIII) instead of the full viral particle. Our results demonstrated that DENV-EIII-suppressed megakaryopoiesis is similar to those observed with DENV infection. Furthermore, in agreement with our in vivo analyses, DENV-EIII sufficiently suppressed the megakaryopoiesis of progenitor cells from murine bone marrow and human cord blood in vitro.

TMEM41B is also a recently validated host factor required by flaviviruses and coronaviruses. However, the exact underlying mechanism of TMEM41B in promoting viral infections remains an open question. Here, we validated that both TMEM41B and VMP1 are essential host dependency factors for all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), but not chikungunya virus (CHIKV). While HCoV-OC43 failed to replicate entirely in both TMEM41B- and VMP1-deficient cells, we detected diminished levels of DENV infections in these cell lines, which were accompanied by upregulation of the innate immune dsRNA sensors, RIG-I and MDA5. Nonetheless, this upregulation did not correspondingly induce the downstream effector TBK1 activation and Interferon-beta expression. Despite low levels of DENV replication, classical DENV replication organelles were undetectable in the infected TMEM41B-deficient cells, suggesting that the upregulation of the dsRNA sensors is likely a consequence of aberrant viral replication rather than a causal factor for reduced DENV infection. Intriguingly, we uncovered that the inhibitory effect of TMEM41B deficiency on DENV replication, but not HCoV-OC43, can be partially reversed using exogenous fatty acid supplements. In contrast, VMP1 deficiency cannot be rescued using the metabolite treatment.

The induction of TRAIL expression by DV was found to be dependent on an intact type I interferon signaling pathway. A significant increase in DV RNA accumulation was observed in anti-TRAIL antibody-treated monocytes, B cells, and HUVECs, and, conversely, a decrease in DV RNA was seen in recombinant TRAIL-treated monocytes.

Capsid, NS1 and NS3 proteins showing high colocalization with LC3 protein in the cytoplasm of the infected cells were detected in the purified double-membrane autophagosome by immunogold labeling under transmission electron microscopy. In DENV infected cells, the levels of capsid, envelope, NS1 and HMGB1 proteins are not significantly changed compared to the dramatic accumulation of LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 proteins when autophagic degradation was blocked by chloroquine, indicating that these proteins are not regulated by autophagic degradation machinery.

While its incidence is increasing in many countries, there is no approved antiviral therapy currently available. In infected cells, the DENV induces extensive morphological alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to generate viral replication organelles (vRO), which include convoluted membranes (CM) and vesicle packets (VP) hosting viral RNA replication. The viral non-structural protein NS4B localizes to vROs and is absolutely required for viral replication through poorly defined mechanisms, which might involve cellular protein partners. Previous interactomic studies identified the ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a DENV NS4B-interacting host factor in infected cells. Using both pharmacological and dominant-negative inhibition approaches, we show, in this study, that VCP ATPase activity is required for efficient DENV replication. VCP associates with NS4B when expressed in the absence of other viral proteins while in infected cells, both proteins colocalize within large DENV-induced cytoplasmic structures previously demonstrated to be CMs. Consistently, VCP inhibition dramatically reduces the abundance of DENV CMs in infected cells. Most importantly, using a recently reported replication-independent plasmid-based vRO induction system, we show that de novo VP biogenesis is dependent on VCP ATPase activity. Overall, our data demonstrate that VCP ATPase activity is required for vRO morphogenesis and/or stability. Considering that VCP was shown to be required for the replication of other flaviviruses, our results argue that VCP is a pan-flaviviral host dependency factor.

Interactions of NS5 with host proteins also modulate host immune responses. Although replication occurs in the cytoplasm, an unusual characteristic of DENV2 NS5 is that it localizes to the nucleus during infection with no clear role in replication or pathogenesis. We examined NS5 of DENV1 and 2, which exhibit the most prominent difference in nuclear localization, employing a combination of functional and structural analyses. Extensive gene swapping between DENV1 and 2 NS5 identified that the C-terminal 18 residues (Cter18) alone was sufficient to direct the protein to the cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively. The low micromolar binding affinity between NS5 Cter18 and the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha (Impα), allowed their molecular complex to be purified, crystallised and visualized at 2.2 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis of this region in GFP-NS5 clones of DENV1 or 2 and in a DENV2 infectious clone reveal residues important for NS5 subcellular localization. Notably, the trans conformation adopted by Pro-884 allows proper presentation for binding Impα and mutating this proline to Thr, as present in DENV1 NS5, results in mislocalizaion of NS5 to the cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness. In contrast, a single mutation to alanine at NS5 position R888, a residue conserved in all flaviviruses, resulted in a completely non-viable virus, and the R888K mutation led to a severely attenuated phentoype, even though NS5 was located in the nucleus.

Results: NS3 residue Asn-570 is essential for its interaction with NS5; mutation in an infectious cDNA abolished virus production and reduced positive-strand RNA synthesis. Conclusion: NS3-NS5 interaction may be required for coordinated positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis. Significance: NS3-NS5 interaction may be a target for rational design of antiviral drugs. Dengue virus multifunctional proteins NS3 protease/helicase and NS5 methyltransferase/RNA-dependent RNA polymerase form part of the viral replication complex and are involved in viral RNA genome synthesis, methylation of the 5′-cap of viral genome, and polyprotein processing among other activities. Previous studies have shown that NS5 residue Lys-330 is required for interaction between NS3 and NS5. Here, we show by competitive NS3-NS5 interaction ELISA that the NS3 peptide spanning residues 566–585 disrupts NS3-NS5 interaction but not the null-peptide bearing the N570A mutation. Small angle x-ray scattering study on NS3(172–618) helicase and covalently linked NS3(172–618)-NS5(320–341) reveals a rigid and compact formation of the latter, indicating that peptide NS5(320–341) engages in specific and discrete interaction with NS3. Significantly, NS3:Asn-570 to alanine mutation introduced into an infectious DENV2 cDNA clone did not yield detectable virus by plaque assay even though intracellular double-stranded RNA was detected by immunofluorescence. Detection of increased negative-strand RNA synthesis by real time RT-PCR for the NS3:N570A mutant suggests that NS3-NS5 interaction plays an important role in the balanced synthesis of positive- and negative-strand RNA for robust viral replication. Dengue virus infection has become a global concern, and the lack of safe vaccines or antiviral treatments urgently needs to be addressed.

We performed mutational analyses of IFITM3 and identified multiple residues within the CD225 domain, consisting of the first intramembrane domain (intramembrane domain 1 [IM1]) and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL), that are required for restriction of both influenza A virus (IAV) and dengue virus (DENV) infection in vitro. Two phenylalanines within IM1 (F75 and F78) also mediate a physical association between IFITM proteins, and the loss of this interaction decreases IFITM3-mediated restriction. By extension, similar IM1-mediated associations may contribute to the functions of additional members of the CD225 domain family. IFITM3's distal N-terminal domain is also needed for full antiviral activity, including a tyrosine (Y20), whose alteration results in mislocalization of a portion of IFITM3 to the cell periphery and surface. Comparative analyses demonstrate that similar molecular determinants are needed for IFITM3's restriction of both IAV and DENV. However, a portion of the CIL including Y99 and R87 is preferentially needed for inhibition of the orthomyxovirus. Several IFITM3 proteins engineered with rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated reduced expression or mislocalization, and these events were associated with enhanced viral replication in vitro, suggesting that possessing such alleles may impact an individual's risk for viral infection.

The replication of WNV takes place on virus-modified membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell, and virions acquire their envelope by budding into this organelle. Consistent with this view, the cellular biology of this pathogen is intimately linked to modifications of the intracellular membranes, and the requirement for specific lipids, such as cholesterol and fatty acids, has been documented. In this study, we evaluated the impact of WNV infection on two important components of cellular membranes, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, by mass spectrometry of infected cells. A significant increase in the content of several glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, plasmalogens, and lysophospholipids) and sphingolipids (ceramide, dihydroceramide, and sphingomyelin) was noticed in WNV-infected cells, suggesting that these lipids have functional roles during WNV infection. Furthermore, the analysis of the lipid envelope of WNV virions and recombinant virus-like particles revealed that their envelopes had a unique composition. The envelopes were enriched in sphingolipids (sphingomyelin) and showed reduced levels of phosphatidylcholine, similar to sphingolipid-enriched lipid microdomains. Inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase (which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide) by either pharmacological approaches or small interfering RNA-mediated silencing reduced the release of flavivirus virions as well as virus-like particles, suggesting a role of sphingomyelin-to-ceramide conversion in flavivirus budding and confirming the importance of sphingolipids in the biogenesis of WNV. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus spread by mosquitoes that can infect multiple vertebrate hosts, including humans. There is no specific vaccine or therapy against this pathogen licensed for human use. Since the multiplication of this virus is associated with rearrangements of host cell membranes, we analyzed the effect of WNV infection on different cellular lipids that constitute important membrane components. The levels of multiple lipid species were increased in infected cells, pointing to the induction of major alterations of cellular lipid metabolism by WNV infection. Interestingly, certain sphingolipids, which were increased in infected cells, were also enriched in the lipid envelope of the virus, thus suggesting a potential role during virus assembly. We further verified the role of sphingolipids in the production of WNV by means of functional analyses.

In particular, we show that NS5 alone, or in the context of viral infection, interacts with core components of the U5 snRNP particle, CD2BP2 and DDX23, alters the inclusion/exclusion ratio of alternative splicing events, and changes mRNA isoform abundance of known antiviral factors. Interestingly, a genome wide transcriptome analysis, using recently developed bioinformatics tools, revealed an increase of intron retention upon dengue virus infection, and viral replication was improved by silencing specific U5 components.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 is a multifunctional protein essential for viral replication. To gain insights into NS1 functions in mosquito cells, the protein interactome of DENV NS1 in C6/36 cells was investigated using a proximity biotinylation system and mass spectrometry. A total of 817 mosquito targets were identified as protein–protein interacting with DENV NS1. Approximately 14% of them coincide with interactomes previously obtained in vertebrate cells, including the oligosaccharide transferase complex, the chaperonin containing TCP-1, vesicle localization, and ribosomal proteins. Notably, other protein pathways not previously reported in vertebrate cells, such as epigenetic regulation and RNA silencing, were also found in the NS1 interactome in mosquito cells. Due to the novel and strong interactions observed for NS1 and the epigenetic regulator DIDO1 (Death-Inducer Obliterator 1), the role of DIDO1 in viral replication was further explored. Interactions between NS1 and DIDO1 were corroborated in infected mosquito cells, by colocalization and proximity ligation assays. Silencing DIDO1 expression results in a significant reduction in DENV and ZIKV replication and progeny production. Comparison of transcription analysis of mock or DENV infected cells silenced for DIDO1 revealed variations in multiple gene expression pathways, including pathways associated with DENV infection such as RNA surveillance, IMD, and Toll.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae. The RNA viral genome encodes three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1-dependent manner by an unconventional route. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA and is responsible for the cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate cells, NS1 associates with and relies on the CCC for secretion. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors, such as brefeldin A, Golgicide A, and Fli-06, showed no effect on NS1 secretion but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV-1 or FKBP52 with short interfering RNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion, again without affecting virion release. Colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays indicated that NS1 colocalizes and interacts with all proteins of the CCC. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV-infected cells. Results obtained with Zika virus-infected cells suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway as that observed for DENV NS1. These results uncover important differences in the dengue virus-cell interactions between the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector as well as novel functions for the chaperone caveolin complex.

Interestingly, one recombinant NS5 protein carrying the mutations K456A and K457A located in the F1 motif lacked RNA synthesis dependent on the SLA promoter but displayed high activity using a poly(rC) template. Promoter RNA binding of this NS5 mutant was unaffected while de novo RNA synthesis was abolished. Furthermore, the mutant maintained RNA elongation activity, indicating a role of the F1 region in promoter-dependent initiation. In addition, four NS5 mutants were selected to have polymerase activity in the recombinant protein but delayed or impaired virus replication when introduced into an infectious clone, suggesting a role of these amino acids in other functions of NS5.

The genome of flaviviruses bears a type 1 cap structure at its 5′ end, needed for the main translation initiation mechanism. Several members of the genus also use a cap-independent translation mechanism. The present work provides evidence that the WNV 5′ end also promotes a cap-independent translation initiation mechanism in mammalian and insect cells, reinforcing the hypothesis that this might be a general strategy of flaviviruses.

The results also show that the 3′ UTR of the WNV genome enhances translation of the cap-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, WNV 3′ UTR can be replaced by the 3′ UTR of other flaviviruses and the translation enhancing effect is maintained, suggesting a molecular mechanism that does not involve direct RNA-RNA interactions to be at work.

The crystal structure of E protein at the postfusion state suggested the involvement of the stem during the fusion; however, the critical domains or residues involved remain unknown. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to replace each of the stem residues at the hydrophobic face with an alanine or proline in a DENV serotype 4 (DENV4) precursor membrane (prM)/E expression construct. Most of the 15 proline mutations at either EH1 or EH2 severely affected the assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs). Radioimmunoprecipitation and membrane flotation assays revealed that EH1 mutations primarily affect prM-E heterodimerization and EH2 mutations affect the membrane binding of the stem. Introducing four proline mutations at either EH1 or EH2 into a DENV2 replicon packaging system greatly affects assembly and entry. Moreover, introducing these mutations into a DENV2 infectious clone confirmed the impairment in assembly and infectivity.

Here we demonstrate that the protein also enables effective proliferation of dengue virus and Zika virus, indicating that AUF1 is a general flavivirus host factor. Further studies demonstrated that the AUF1 isoform p45 significantly stimulates the initiation of viral RNA replication and that the protein's RNA chaperone activity enhances the interactions of the viral 5′UAR and 3′UAR genome cyclization sequences. Most interestingly, we observed that AUF1 p45 destabilizes not only the 3′-terminal stem-loop (3′SL) but also 5′-terminal stem-loop B (SLB) of the viral genome. RNA structure analyses revealed that AUF1 p45 increases the accessibility of defined nucleotides within the 3′SL and SLB and, in this way, exposes both UAR cyclization elements. Conversely, AUF1 p45 does not modulate the fold of stem-loop A (SLA) at the immediate genomic 5′ end, which is proposed to function as a promoter of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). These findings suggest that AUF1 p45, by destabilizing specific stem-loop structures within the 5′ and 3′ ends of the flaviviral genome, assists genome cyclization and concurrently enables the RdRp to initiate RNA synthesis. Our study thus highlights the role of a cellular RNA-binding protein inducing a flaviviral RNA switch that is crucial for viral replication. IMPORTANCE The genus Flavivirus within the Flaviviridae family includes important human pathogens, such as dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses. The initiation of replication of the flaviviral RNA genome requires a transformation from a linear to a cyclized form. This involves considerable structural reorganization of several RNA motifs at the genomic 5′ and 3′ ends. Specifically, it needs a melting of stem structures to expose complementary 5′ and 3′ cyclization elements to enable their annealing during cyclization. Here we show that a cellular RNA chaperone, AUF1 p45, which supports the replication of all three aforementioned flaviviruses, specifically rearranges stem structures at both ends of the viral genome and in this way permits 5′-3′ interactions of cyclization elements. Thus, AUF1 p45 triggers the RNA switch in the flaviviral genome that is crucial for viral replication. These findings represent an important example of how cellular (host) factors promote the propagation of RNA viruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A cellular RNA chaperone, AUF1 p45, which supports the replication of all three aforementioned flaviviruses, specifically rearranges stem structures at both ends of the viral genome and in this way permits 5′-3′ interactions of cyclization elements."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1436,"details":{"paperId":"d0c00db3c8224676a4910db972f1a0efdf98d4b5","externalIds":{"MAG":"2767401463","DOI":"10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.055","CorpusId":"22795531","PubMed":"29117567"},"title":"The Host Protein Reticulon 3.1A Is Utilized by Flaviviruses to Facilitate Membrane Remodelling.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A crucial role is identified for the membrane-bending host protein Reticulon 3.1A for the viral remodelling of host membranes during efficient flavivirus replication and the stabilization of viral proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1419,"details":{"paperId":"38b51dd8bae5027949cdb9d86250ad11a4e0ad96","externalIds":{"MAG":"2003988251","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2009.12.017","CorpusId":"17413284","PubMed":"20064371"},"title":"The IFITM Proteins Mediate Cellular Resistance to Influenza A H1N1 Virus, West Nile Virus, and Dengue Virus","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is discovered that the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM1, 2, and 3 restrict an early step in influenza A viral replication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7956,"details":{"paperId":"a4cda8f786e3c1ac1c8a6e9d531f5f1580f466ba","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"5294983","MAG":"2576929789","DOI":"10.3390/v9010014","CorpusId":"11601310","PubMed":"28106839"},"title":"The IMPORTance of the Nucleus during Flavivirus Replication","abstract":"Flaviviruses are a large group of arboviruses of significant medical concern worldwide.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Translation initiation of DENV mRNA can occur by a cap-dependent or a cap-independent mechanism. Two non-mutually exclusive cap-independent mechanisms of translation initiation have been described for DENV mRNA. The first corresponds to a 5′-end-dependent, internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-independent mechanism, while the second relies on IRES-dependent initiation. In this report, we study the recently discovered DENV IRES. The results show that the DENV IRES is functional in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). In accordance, the activity of the DENV IRES was resistant to the cleavage of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) by the Foot-and-mouth disease virus leader protease in RRL. In cells, the DENV IRES exhibited only marginal activity under standard culture conditions. The DENV IRES showed weak activity in HEK 293T cells; however, DENV IRES activity was significantly enhanced in HEK 293T cells expressing Human rhinovirus 2A protease.

This study aimed to investigate the role of mosquito Aedes aegypti atlastin (AaATL) in dengue virus replication and maintenance of Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium, in the mosquito. ABSTRACT Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping atlastin proteins (ATLs) have been demonstrated to play a functional role during flavivirus replication in mammalian cells. For dengue virus (DENV), atlastin is required in the formation of the replication organelles and RNA replication, virion assembly, production of the infectious virus particles, and trafficking or directing the association of vesicle packets with furin. Here, we investigated the involvement of atlastin in DENV replication in the mosquito Aedes aegypti and explored the possibility of its manipulation by the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia to interfere with DENV replication. Results showed the expression of Ae. aegypti atlastin gene (AaATL) was upregulated in DENV-infected Aag2 cells, and its silencing led to reduced DENV replication. Contrary to our assumption that AaATL could be downregulated by Wolbachia, we did not find evidence for that in Wolbachia-infected cell lines, but this was the case in mosquitoes. Further, silencing AaATL did not have any effect on Wolbachia density. Our results also suggest that aae-miR-989 miRNA negatively regulates AaATL. The oversupply of the miRNA mimic led to reduced DENV replication consistent with the positive role of AaATL in DENV replication. Overall, the results favor AaATL’s involvement in DENV replication; however, there is no support that the protein is involved in Wolbachia-mediated DENV inhibition. In addition, the results contribute to discerning further possible overlapping functions of ATLs in mosquitoes and mammalian cells.

Further, AaATL was found to be regulated by a mosquito microRNA, aae-miR-989.

Substitutions of three nonhydrophobic residues at the N terminus of the first helix (T1) and at either the N or C terminus of the second helix of the TMD with three hydrophobic residues, as well as an increase in the length of T1, led to the release of chimeric CD4 and E protein from the ER, suggesting that short length and certain nonhydrophobic residues of the TMD are critical for ER retention. The analysis of enveloped viruses assembled at the plasma membrane and of those assembled in the Golgi complex and ER revealed a trend of decreasing length and increasing nonhydrophobic residues of the TMD of E proteins. Taken together, these findings support a TMD-dependent sorting for viral E proteins along the secretory pathway. Moreover, similar mutations introduced into the TMD of DENV E protein resulted in the increased production of virus-like particles (VLPs), suggesting that modifications of TMD facilitate VLP production and have implications for utilizing flaviviral VLPs as serodiagnostic antigens and vaccine candidates.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Findings support a TMD-dependent sorting for viral E proteins along the secretory pathway and have implications for utilizing flaviviral VLPs as serodiagnostic antigens and vaccine candidates."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7695,"details":{"paperId":"ebf21b74f0aaa02c0ebbf28f73a4f58ba4442c34","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7593908","MAG":"3092319732","DOI":"10.3390/ijms21207520","CorpusId":"222420612","PubMed":"33053895"},"title":"The Lethal(2)-Essential-for-Life [L(2)EFL] Gene Family Modulates Dengue Virus Infection in Aedes aegypti","abstract":"Efforts to determine the mosquito genes that affect dengue virus replication have identified a number of candidates that positively or negatively modify amplification in the invertebrate host.

For several of these pathogens, neither antivirals nor vaccines are currently available. In addition to this unmet medical need, flaviviruses are of particular interest since they constitute an excellent model for the study of spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism. Indeed, with no DNA intermediate or nuclear step, the flaviviral life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of a single RNA species, namely the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) which contains all the genetic information necessary for optimal viral replication. From a single open reading frame, the vRNA encodes a polyprotein which is processed to generate the mature viral proteins. In addition to coding for the viral polyprotein, the vRNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and is also selectively packaged into newly assembled viral particles. Notably, vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in time and space via a fine-tuned equilibrium as these processes cannot occur simultaneously and hence, are mutually exclusive. As such, these dynamic processes involve several vRNA secondary and tertiary structures as well as RNA modifications. Finally, the vRNA can be detected as a foreign molecule by cytosolic sensors which trigger upon activation antiviral signaling pathways and the production of antiviral factors such as interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. However, to create an environment favorable to infection, flaviviruses have evolved mechanisms to dampen these antiviral processes, notably through the production of a specific vRNA degradation product termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA).

In this report, we demonstrate that NS4A associates with membranes via 4 internal hydrophobic regions, which are all able to mediate membrane targeting of a cytosolic reporter protein. We also developed a model for the membrane topology of NS4A in which the N-terminal third of NS4A localizes to the cytoplasm, while the remaining part contains three transmembrane segments, with the C-terminal end localized in the ER lumen. Subcellular localization experiments in DV-infected cells revealed that NS4A resides primarily in ER-derived cytoplasmic dot-like structures that also contain dsRNA and other DV proteins, suggesting that NS4A is a component of the membrane-bound viral replication complex (RC). Interestingly, the individual expression of DV NS4A lacking the 2K fragment resulted in the induction of cytoplasmic membrane alterations resembling virus-induced structures, whereas expression of full-length NS4A does not induce comparable membrane alterations. Thus, proteolytic removal of the 2K peptide appears to be important for induction of membrane alterations that may harbor the viral RC.

Although flaviviruses have a cytoplasmic replicative cycle, some viral proteins such as the capsid (C) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, NS5, can reach the nucleus of the infected cells. Considering the important roles of NS5 in viral replication and in the control of the immune response, and its striking presence in the nucleus, the possible functions of this protein in some mechanisms orchestrated by the nucleus was analyzed. We isolated and identified nuclear proteins that interact with NS5; one of them, the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 is relocated to the cytoplasm and degraded during infection with DENV, which correlates with its function in IFN dependent response. Since DDX5 and many other proteins are relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during flavivirus infection, the integrity and function of the main regulator of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, the nuclear pore complex (NPC) was evaluated. We found that during DENV and ZIKV infection nucleoporins (NUPs) such as TPR, Nup153, Nup98, and Nup62 were cleavaged/degraded. The protease NS2B-NS3 induces NUPs degradation and it causes a dramatic inhibition of mature mRNAs export to the cytoplasm but not the export of DDX5 protein, which is dependent on NS5. Here we describe for the first time that the NS3 and NS5 proteins from flavivirus play novel functions hijacking the NPC and some nuclear proteins relevant in triggering immune response pathways, inducing a favorable environment for viral replication. IMPORTANCE Viruses, as intracellular obligate parasites, hijack cellular components to enter and replicate in infected cells. Remarkably, in many cases, viruses hijack molecules with crucial functions for the cells. Here it is described how RNA viruses such as DENV and ZIKV, with a cytoplasmic replicative cycle, use NS3 and NS5, two of their unique non-structural proteins with enzymatic activity, to modulate nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. We found that NS3 disrupts the nuclear pore complex, the main regulator in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, causing a strong reduction in the amount of mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm and an inhibition in innate immune response. Additionally, NS5 induces the relocation of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm such as DDX5, involved in immune response, which is later degraded by NS3. These findings allow the understanding of crucial mechanisms that viruses use to deal with the control of the immune response to grant the production of new viral particles.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"How RNA viruses such as DENV and ZIKV use NS3 and NS5, two of their unique non-structural proteins with enzymatic activity, to modulate nuclear-cytoplasmic transport is described, allowing the understanding of crucial mechanisms that viruses use to deal with the control of the immune response to grant the production of new viral particles."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7843,"details":{"paperId":"8e98784f69f9c4f559124ac40fcc44eca823e427","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7354628","MAG":"3029643930","DOI":"10.3390/v12060583","CorpusId":"218985951","PubMed":"32466480"},"title":"The Nuclear Pore Complex: A Target for NS3 Protease of Dengue and Zika Viruses","abstract":"During flavivirus infection, some viral proteins move to the nucleus and cellular components are relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

We previously demonstrated that the TIM and TAM families of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) receptors involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells mediate DENV entry into target cells. We show here that human CD300a, a recently identified phospholipid receptor, also binds directly DENV particles and enhances viral entry. CD300a facilitates infection of the four DENV serotypes, as well as of other mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile virus and Chikungunya virus. CD300a acts as an attachment factor that enhances DENV internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. CD300a recognizes predominantly phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEth) and to a lesser extent PtdSer associated with viral particles. Mutation of residues in the IgV domain critical for phospholipid binding abrogate CD300a-mediated enhancement of DENV infection. Finally, we show that CD300a is expressed at the surface of primary macrophages and anti-CD300a polyclonal antibodies partially inhibited DENV infection of these cells. Overall, these data indicate that CD300a is a novel DENV binding receptor that recognizes PtdEth and PtdSer present on virions and enhance infection. IMPORTANCE Dengue disease, caused by dengue virus (DENV), has emerged as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans and is a major global health concern. The molecular bases of DENV-host cell interactions during virus entry are poorly understood, hampering the discovery of new targets for antiviral intervention. We recently discovered that the TIM and TAM proteins, two receptor families involved in the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)-dependent phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells, interact with DENV particles-associated PtdSer through a mechanism that mimics the recognition of apoptotic cells and mediate DENV infection. In this study, we show that CD300a, a novel identified phospholipid receptor, mediates DENV infection. CD300a-dependent DENV infection relies on the direct recognition of phosphatidylethanolamine and to a lesser extent PtdSer associated with viral particles.

Given the genetic austerity of the virus, they depend on cellular factors and organelles to complete its replication. One of the cellular components required for flavivirus infection is cholesterol. Cholesterol is an abundant lipid in biomembranes of eukaryotes cells and is necessary to maintain the cellular homeostasis. Recently, it has been reported, that cholesterol is fundamental during flavivirus infection in both mammal and insect vector models. During infection with DENV, ZIKV, YFV, and WNV the modulation of levels of host-cholesterol facilitates viral entry, replicative complexes formation, assembly, egress, and control of the interferon type I response. This modulation involves changes in cholesterol uptake with the concomitant regulation of cholesterol receptors as well as changes in cholesterol synthesis related to important modifications in cellular metabolism pathways.

While the sequences of this region vary between different flaviviruses, the three-way junction arrangement of secondary structures is conserved in SLA, suggesting that viruses recognize a common structural feature to replicate the viral genome rather than a particular sequence. To better understand the molecular basis of genome recognition by flaviviruses, we recently determined the crystal structures of flavivirus SLAs from dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). In this review, I will provide an overview of (1) flaviviral genome replication; (2) structures of viral SLA promoters and NS5 polymerases; and (3) and describe our current model of how NS5 polymerases specifically recognize the SLA at the 5′ terminus of the viral genome to initiate RNA synthesis at the 3′ terminus.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The crystal structures of flavivirus SLAs from dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) recently determined and the current model of how NS5 polymerases specifically recognize the SLA at the 5′ terminus of the viral genome to initiate RNA synthesis at the 3′terminus are described."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7235,"details":{"paperId":"158fd16b1c90f8764ecb3ca291e0a515d4735503","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.22207/jpam.16.3.11","CorpusId":"250634763"},"title":"The Roles of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10 (CXCL10) in Dengue","abstract":"Early diagnosis of dengue is crucial to prevent the progression to severe dengue (SD) leading to mortality rate reduction.

After its internalization, the protein was detected intracellularly for at least 48 h without being substantially degraded. Colocalization studies of sNS1 with markers of the endolysosomal compartments revealed that the protein was specifically targeted to lysobisphosphatidic acid-rich structures reminiscent of late endosomes, as confirmed by electron microscopy.

Results: prM-stem region binds tighter to both E protein and lipid membrane when environment becomes acidic. Conclusion: At acidic condition, E proteins are attracted to the membrane-associated prM-stem. Significance: prM-stem region induces virus structural changes during maturation. Newly assembled dengue viruses (DENV) undergo maturation to become infectious particles. The maturation process involves major rearrangement of virus surface premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins. The prM-E complexes on immature viruses are first assembled as trimeric spikes in the neutral pH environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. When the virus is transported to the low pH environment of the exosomes, these spikes rearrange into dimeric structures, which lie parallel to the virus lipid envelope. The proteins involved in driving this process are unknown. Previous cryoelectron microscopy studies of the mature DENV showed that the prM-stem region (residues 111–131) is membrane-associated and may interact with the E proteins. Here we investigated the prM-stem region in modulating the virus maturation process. The binding of the prM-stem region to the E protein was shown to increase significantly at low pH compared with neutral pH in ELISAs and surface plasmon resonance studies. In addition, the affinity of the prM-stem region for the liposome, as measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, was also increased when pH is lowered.

During infection, pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) are produced by resisting degradation by the 5′→3′ host cell exonuclease Xrn1 through an unknown RNA structure-based mechanism. Here, we present the crystal structure of a complete Xrn1-resistant flaviviral RNA, which contains interwoven pseudoknots within a compact structure that depends on highly conserved nucleotides. The RNA’s three-dimensional topology creates a ringlike conformation, with the 5′ end of the resistant structure passing through the ring from one side of the fold to the other. Disruption of this structure prevents formation of sfRNA during flaviviral infection. Thus, sfRNA formation results from an RNA fold that interacts directly with Xrn1, presenting the enzyme with a structure that confounds its helicase activity.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The crystal structure of a complete Xrn1-resistant flaviviral RNA is presented, which contains interwoven pseudoknots within a compact structure that depends on highly conserved nucleotides."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":6412,"details":{"paperId":"6c96f2dae16104615fd451ba14528214fcefacf8","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3477123","MAG":"2014754084","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0047596","CorpusId":"17719333","PubMed":"23094066"},"title":"The Structural Dynamics of the Flavivirus Fusion Peptide–Membrane Interaction","abstract":"Membrane fusion is a crucial step in flavivirus infections and a potential target for antiviral strategies.

Despite the large volume of information available on the virus-triggered fusion process, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind flavivirus–cell membrane fusion.

We used an in silico approach to simulate the interaction of the FPs with a lipid bilayer in a complementary way and used spectroscopic approaches to collect conformation information. We found that both peptides interact with neutral and anionic micelles, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed the interaction of the FPs with the lipid bilayer. The participation of the indole ring of Trp appeared to be important for the anchoring of both peptides in the membrane model, as indicated by MD simulations and spectroscopic analyses. Mild differences between FLAG and FLAH were observed according to the pH and the charge of the target membrane model. The MD simulations of the membrane showed that both peptides adopted a bend structure, and an interaction between the aromatic residues was strongly suggested, which was also observed by circular dichroism in the presence of micelles.

Results of the present study using an infectious DNA for WN virus strain 956 initially demonstrated that the dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN2) 3′SL nucleotide sequence could not substitute for that of the WN 3′SL to support WN genome replication.

The longer it takes virus to infect the midgut and traverse to the saliva, the fewer opportunities the mosquito will have to transmit the pathogen over its lifetime. We have shown previously that EIP for dengue virus is highly heritable and that it is negatively correlated with vector lifespan. Here, we examined the transcriptional profiles for mosquitoes that varied in their EIP phenotype and identified pathways associated with either short or long EIP. We found that mosquitoes with short EIP have less active immune responses but higher levels of protein translation and calcium ion homeostasis and that mosquitoes with longer EIP may have slower metabolism.

TM1 functions as a stop-transfer sequence and TM2 as an internal signal sequence for the first nonstructural protein during polyprotein processing. The possible role of this peculiar C-terminal helical hairpin in membrane fusion has not been investigated so far. We addressed this question by studying TM mutants of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) recombinant subviral particles (RSPs), an established model system for flavivirus membrane fusion. The engineered mutations included the deletion of TM2, the replacement of both TM domains (TMDs) by those of the related Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and the use of chimeric TBEV-JEV membrane anchors. Using these mutant RSPs, we provide evidence that TM2 is not just a remnant of polyprotein processing but, together with TM1, plays an active role in fusion. None of the TM mutations, including the deletion of TM2, affected early steps of the fusion process, but TM interactions apparently contribute to the stability of the postfusion E trimer and the completion of the merger of the membranes.

The RNA viral genome encodes for a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional viral protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during DENV infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent manner by an unconventional pathway. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA which is responsible for cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A, golgicide A and Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV1, FKBP52 with siRNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine A resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion without affecting virion release. Using co-localization, co-inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, NS1 was found to co-localize and interact with all the protein components of the CCC in mosquito infected cells.

AUTHOR SUMMARY Dengue protein NS1 is secreted in infected mosquito and vertebrate cells. In humans, secreted NS1 have been associated with pathogenesis. In mosquito cells, NS1 follows an unconventional secretion pathway that is dependent on Caveolin-1. This work shows that in mosquito cells, NS1 secretion is associated to the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and several chaperones, in charge of cholesterol transport within the cells. Reduction of the expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release. Direct interaction between NS1 and the chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays. Moreover, increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus infection. Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear. However, giving the importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC, and the association of NS1 with the cholesterol transporter CCC agrees with the lipoprotein nature of secreted hexameric NS1."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4414,"details":{"paperId":"e56d234290ad51eeaaf4723d1daf9c8da20ab7a7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2996133461","DOI":"10.1101/871988","CorpusId":"213156847"},"title":"The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) use the scavenger receptor B1 as cell receptor in human hepatic and mosquito cells","abstract":"Dengue is the most common virus disease transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein that form part of replication complexes. In addition, NS1 is also secreted, as a hexamer, to the extracellular milieu. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several different mechanisms. Cell binding and internalization of soluble NS1 result in the disruption of tight junctions and in down regulation of the innate immune response. In this work, we report that the HDL scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) in human hepatic cells, and a scavenger receptor B1-like in mosquito C6/36 cells act as cell surface binding receptor for dengue virus NS1. The presence of the SRB1 on the plasma membrane of C6/36 cells, as well as in Huh-7 cells, was demonstrated by confocal microcopy. Internalization of NS1 can be efficiently blocked by anti-SRB1 antibodies and previous incubation of the cells with HDL significantly reduces NS1 internalization. In addition, the transient expression of SRB1 in Vero cells, which lack the receptor, renders these cells susceptible to NS1 entry. Direct interaction between soluble NS1 and the SRB1 in Huh7 and C6/36 cells was demonstrated in vivo by proximity ligation assays an in vitro by surface plasmon resonance.

It has been implicated in a diverse array of cellular functions, including production, trafficking, and degradation of proteins; synthesis and distribution of lipids and steroids; calcium sequestration and release; cell signaling and innate immunity; carbohydrate metabolism; and detoxification of harmful substances [1]. Such a ubiquitous and functionally versatile organelle is parasitized by viruses in order to facilitate their life cycle. Rotavirus, vaccinia virus (VV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as members of the Flavivirus genus—dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV)—are all intimately associated with the ER [2]. The flaviviruses replicate on the ER membranes and form immature viral particles that bud into the ER lumen. These particles are then trafficked through the ER–Golgi network and undergo a maturation process brought about by pH alteration and cleavage by the hostprotease Furin. This viral takeover of the ER requires the co-opting of cellular proteins as well as the active remodeling of the ER membrane to create a cellular environment more conducive to replication [3]. Several ER proteins have been identified as host factors in flavivirus replication [4], but a class of resident proteins that shape and maintain the dynamic ER architecture are of particular interest. These “ER-shaping” proteins could potentially serve as host factors that support viral replication or restriction factors that protect the ER. Interactome and CRISPR screens have produced somewhat discordant results, but the less stringent screens suggest that ER-shaping proteins may be targets of viral proteins [5] [6] [7].

Understanding the distinct and unique changes in hematological components of the bone marrow induced by a particular pathogen or corresponding to a specific illness may be a valuable asset for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. A good example of a pathogen that could be better evaluated with greater knowledge of the bone marrow is dengue, one of the most important public vector-borne human diseases.

Although large amounts of data have been generated in the literature, there remains a large gap between this information and its relevance for the purpose of patient care. While evaluating the cellular components in the circulated blood from ill patients provides us with valuable information about the pathogenesis of various pathogens, there are other players participating in the progression to disease.

DENV consists in a 50 nm-diameter enveloped particle in which the surface proteins are arranged with icosahedral symmetry, while information about nucleocapsid (NC) structural organization is lacking. DENV NC is composed of the viral genome, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, packaged by the capsid (C) protein. Here, we established the conditions for a reproducible in vitro assembly of DENV nucleocapsid-like particles (NCLPs) using recombinant DENVC. We analyzed NCLP formation in the absence or presence of oligonucleotides in solution using small angle X-ray scattering, Rayleigh light scattering as well as fluorescence anisotropy, and characterized particle structural properties using atomic force and transmission electron microscopy imaging. The experiments in solution comparing 2-, 5- and 25-mer oligonucleotides established that 2-mer is too small and 5-mer is sufficient for the formation of NCLPs. The assembly process was concentration-dependent and showed a saturation profile, with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (DENVC:oligonucleotide) molar ratio, suggesting an equilibrium involving DENVC dimer and an organized structure compatible with NCLPs. Imaging methods proved that the decrease in concentration to sub-nanomolar concentrations of DENVC allows the formation of regular spherical NCLPs after protein deposition on mica or carbon surfaces, in the presence as well as in the absence of oligonucleotides, in this latter case being surface driven. Altogether, the results suggest that in vitro assembly of DENV NCLPs depends on DENVC charge neutralization, which must be a very coordinated process to avoid unspecific aggregation. Our hypothesis is that a specific highly positive spot in DENVC α4-α4’ is the main DENVC-RNA binding site, which is required to be firstly neutralized to allow NC formation.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2414,"details":{"paperId":"b8381131670a25df29f361580f519d21aa033218","externalIds":{"MAG":"2093990827","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2011.06.022","CorpusId":"205646503","PubMed":"21767858"},"title":"The interaction of flavivirus M protein with light chain Tctex-1 of human dynein plays a role in late stages of virus replication.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that dynein light chain Tctex-1 interacts with the ectoM of dengue 1-4, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis flaviviruses and may play a role in late stages of viral replication through its interaction with the membrane protein."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":2492,"details":{"paperId":"520b7a51136e27e934b4d03e32d01fa270bf1cc2","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2022.02.001","CorpusId":"246629906","PubMed":"35149346"},"title":"The interactions of flaviviruses with cellular receptors: Implications for virus entry.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This mini-review will focus on recent progresses in the understanding of virus attachment, internalization, and membrane fusion with specific emphasis on the cellular receptors."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":406,"details":{"paperId":"f23e3e638dccf2ff9d2b6daabbbee54f6047a302","externalIds":{"MAG":"151163233","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-7091-9326-6_34","CorpusId":"28066025","PubMed":"7913359"},"title":"The interactions of the flavivirus envelope proteins: implications for virus entry and release.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The functional role of prM before its endoproteolytic cleavage by a cellular protease thus seems to be the protection of protein E from acid-inactivation during its passage through acidic trans Golgi vesicles in the course of virus release."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4305,"details":{"paperId":"5d7d6b0f85ec80cc68ccd61e5ea4fd1c4172e5d8","externalIds":{"MAG":"3035083498","DOI":"10.1101/2020.06.10.144089","CorpusId":"219604195"},"title":"The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 is essential for Dengue virus infection","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent and rapidly spreading arboviral disease of humans. It enters human cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Numerous cell surface proteins have been proposed as DENV entry factors. Among these, the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM-1 is the only one known to mediate virus internalization. However, several cellular models lacking TIM-1 are permissive to DENV infection, suggesting that other receptors exist. Here we show that the Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) binds DENV virions by interacting with the DIII of the viral envelope glycoprotein. DENV infection is effectively inhibited by the purified receptor at 5×10−8 mol/L and the interaction of the envelope protein with LRP1 is also blocked by a natural ligand of LRP1. Depletion of LRP1 causes 100-fold lower production of infectious virus than controls. Our results indicate that LRP1 is another DENV receptor thus, becoming an attractive target to evaluate for the development of effective antiviral drugs against DENV. Author summary Dengue virus (DENV) is a complex of four related viruses, recognized as serotypes, designated as DENV1-4. Any of the four DENV serotypes can cause a self-limited disease of mild flu-like symptoms known as dengue or its life threatening form, severe dengue, with hemorrhagic manifestations, organ impairment and shock. This disease is widely spread in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide, where the incidence of severe dengue has been increasing steadily. So far, efforts that target components of the viral replication machinery in order to develop a specific antiviral drug for dengue disease patients have failed. Thus, identifying the cell surface receptors used by DENV to enter host cells would provide a new molecular target to develop inhibitory drugs. Here, we evaluate the Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) as a putative DENV receptor. We present evidence demonstrating that LRP1 binds DENV through the viral envelope protein. We show that the production of infective virus is impaired on cells lacking LRP1, and that purified LRP1 is a potent blocker of DENV infection. These results are consistent with LRP1 playing an important role on DENV entry, making this receptor a molecule of interest on the investigation for medical treatments of dengue/severe dengue disease.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that the production of infective virus is impaired on cells lacking LRP1, and that purified LRP2 is a potent blocker of DENV infection, showing this receptor is an attractive target to evaluate for the development of effective antiviral drugs against DENV."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":3935,"details":{"paperId":"0d2e104692f3e6806696203270722540a07e1b8f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8887478","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkac061","CorpusId":"246677473","PubMed":"35137150"},"title":"The low-resolution structural models of hepatitis C virus RNA subdomain 5BSL3.2 and its distal complex with domain 3′X point to conserved regulatory mechanisms within the Flaviviridae family","abstract":"Abstract Subdomain 5BSL3.2 of hepatitis C virus RNA lies at the core of a network of distal RNA–RNA contacts that connect the 5′ and 3′ regions of the viral genome and regulate the translation and replication stages of the viral cycle.

[(3)H]Choline was released at mildly acid pH. The pH threshold depended on the lipid composition. Release from certain liposomes was activated even at neutral pH. To identify the generation of individual pores, single cells were investigated with the patch-clamp technique. The formation of individual pores during low pH-induced WN virus entry at the plasma membrane occurred within seconds. These experiments were performed in parallel with Semliki Forest virus. The results indicated that, similar to alphavirus infection, infection with flaviviruses via endosomes leads to the formation of ion-permeable pores in the endosome after fusion, which allows the flow of protons from the endosome into the cytoplasm during virus entry.

The steady-state polymerase activities of DENV-2 recombinant NS5 and NS5-Pol are compared using different biochemical assays allowing the dissection of the de novo initiation, transition and elongation steps of RNA synthesis. We show that NS5-MTase ensures efficient RdRp activity by stimulating the de novo initiation and the elongation phase. This stimulation is related to a higher affinity of NS5 toward the single-strand RNA template indicating NS5-MTase either completes a high-affinity RNA binding site and/or promotes the correct formation of the template tunnel. Furthermore, the NS5-MTase increases the affinity of the priming nucleotide ATP upon de novo initiation and causes a higher catalytic efficiency of the polymerase upon elongation.

The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of these flaviviruses is secreted from the infected cells using different secretion routes depending on the cell and virus nature. The NS1 of DENV and ZIKV contain in the hydrophobic region a conserved caveolin binding domain (CBD) (ΦXXΦXXXXΦ), which is not conserved in YFV NS1. To ascertain the role of the CBD in the secretory route followed by flavivirus NS1, expression vectors for the NS1 of DENV2, ZIKV and YFV were constructed. Using site-directed mutagenesis, substitutions were made in the aromatic residues within CBD; in addition, the full domain was replaced by those of other flaviviruses, creating chimeras in the CBD of NS1. Substitutions of the aromatic residues to Ala or Thr, or CBD chimeras, results in increased sensitivity of NS1 secretion to brefeldin A treatment, indicating a change to a classical secretion pathway. Likewise, the insertion of the DENV/ZIKV CBD into the recombinant Gaussia-Luciferase results in a loss of sensitivity to BFA treatment, in luciferase secretion. These results suggest that the CBD sequence is a molecular determinant for the unconventional secretory route followed by DENV and ZIKV NS1 in mosquito cells. However, the cellular components that recognize the CBD in the NS1 of DENV and ZIKV and redirect them to an unconventional route and if this secretion route confers unique functions to NS1 within the vector mosquito are aspects currently unknown. Importance Flaviviruses are an important cause of mosquito borne diseases to humans. We have previously demonstrated that the non-structural protein 1 from dengue and zika virus are secreted efficiently from mosquito cells using an unconventional route, that depends on caveolin and molecular chaperones. In this work, we show evidence indicating that a caveolin binding domain, well conserved and exposed in dengue and Zika virus NS1, but absent in other flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus or West Nile virus, is important in determining the unconventional secretion pathway followed by dengue and zika virus NS1 in mosquito cells. The unique secretory pathway followed by NS1 in mosquito cells may result in distinctive viral-cellular protein associations required to facilitate viral infection in the mosquito vector. To identify viral and cellular elements that could disturb the traffic of dengue and Zika virus NS1 may be important to design of strategies for vector control.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Evidence is shown indicating that a caveolin binding domain, well conserved and exposed in dengue and Zika virus NS1, but absent in other flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus or West Nile virus, is important in determining the unconventional secretion pathway followed by d Dengue and zika virus NS 1 in mosquito cells."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":909,"details":{"paperId":"e48ffa3ab2c0d2318ee65dc17b469c8b2caa2dec","externalIds":{"MAG":"2004245923","DOI":"10.1016/0042-6822(91)90079-Q","CorpusId":"27133272","PubMed":"1824904"},"title":"The sensitivity of cell-associated dengue virus proteins to trypsin and the detection of trypsin-resistant fragments of the nonstructural glycoprotein NS1.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Extracts of Vero cells infected with dengue virus type 2 were digested by trypsin in the presence and absence of detergents to test the models proposed for flavivirus translation in which the glycoproteins prM, E, and NS1 are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell whereas certain other nonstructural proteins are not."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7237,"details":{"paperId":"6cda923e547a29a3c1374983a37202c0b2c73e14","externalIds":{"MAG":"2538913332","DOI":"10.2222/JSV.65.179","CorpusId":"12736889","PubMed":"27760916"},"title":"The significance of Hsp70 subnetwork for Dengue virus lifecycle.","abstract":"Viruses hijack host machineries for replicating themselves efficiently.

We examined the maturation phenotype and function of murine bone marrow–derived DCs infected with Langat virus (LGTV), a naturally attenuated member of the TBEV serogroup. LGTV infection failed to induce DC maturation or a cytokine response. Treatment with LPS or LPS/IFN-γ, strong inducers of inflammatory cytokines, resulted in enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production, but suppressed IL-12 production in infected DCs compared with uninfected “bystander” cells or mock-infected controls. LGTV-mediated antagonism of type I IFN (IFN-I) signaling contributed to inhibition of IL-12p40 mRNA expression at late time points after stimulation. However, early suppression was still observed in DCs lacking the IFN-I receptor (Ifnar−/−), suggesting that additional mechanisms of antagonism exist. The early IFN-independent inhibition of IL-12p40 was nearly abolished in DCs deficient in IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a key transcription factor required for IL-12 production. LGTV infection did not affect Irf-1 mRNA expression, but rather diminished IRF-1 protein levels and nuclear localization. The effect on IRF-1 was also observed in DCs infected with the highly virulent Sofjin strain of TBEV.

A physical interaction was identified between NS4B and the helicase \ndomain of NS3 using the yeast two-hybrid assay. This interaction was further \nconfirmed by biochemical pull down and immuno-precipitation assays, both with \npurified proteins and with dengue virus infected cell lysates. Furthermore, NS4B \ndissociated NS3 from single stranded RNA and consequently enhanced the helicase \nactivity of NS3 in an in vitro unwinding assay. A single amino acid mutation in NS4B \n(Hanley et al., 2003) that abolished its interaction with NS3 altered the viral \nreplication. In addition, NS4B co-localized with NS3 in the peri-nuclear region of \ninfected human cells suggesting the in vivo significance of this interaction. These results \nsuggest that NS4B modulates dengue replication via its interaction with NS3. \nSevere dengue has long been speculated to be a result of a complex combination of \nviral, epidemiological and host factors in the context of a secondary infection. Chapter \n3 unveils for the first time, a role for viral genomic variations in dengue pathogenesis \n \nvia modulation of the response to type I IFN. A strain-dependent difference was \ndetected in gene expression levels of the type I interferon response pathway between \ntwo closely related DEN2 strains NGC and TSV01. Activation of type I anti viral \nresponses such as PKR, OAS, ADAR and Mx, were prevalent in infection with TSV01 \nbut not NGC. Biochemical dissection further revealed that NGC but not TSV01 \nsuppressed STAT-1 activation in response to type I IFN but these two strains did not \ndiffer in their response to type II IFN. An extension of this study to low passage clinical \nisolates of various serotypes indicated that this ability to suppress IFN response is \nindependent of serotype as well as viral load. Furthermore, the inability of one such \nclinical isolate SG 167 (isolated during a recent dengue outbreak which was relatively \nmild with very few severe dengue cases) to suppress IFN response indicated that type I \nIFN response could be a prime factor that determines the clinical outcome to dengue \ninfection. \nVirus-induced apoptosis mediated by the unfolded protein response (UPR) is \nhypothesized to be a crucial pathogenic event in dengue infection. Chapter 4 of this \nthesis is one of the first reports on the initial events in dengue infection mediated UPR. \nPhosphorylation of EIF2α was induced in dengue infection but simultaneously, the \nexpression of GADD34 (which dephosphorylates EIF2α) was also enhanced. An \ninhibitor of GADD34 reduced dengue replication in infected cells indicating that this \nviral “compensatory” event is required for viral survival. Both the XBP1 and ATF6 \npathways of the UPR were also activated by dengue infection. In addition, modulation \nof the EIF2α and the XBP1 pathways altered dengue replication indicating that UPR \npathway components affect the outcome of infection. \nChapter 5 summarizes the conclusions from these studies and discusses some of the \nfuture work that can arise from these results. Finally, it is hoped that knowledge gained \nin this thesis will expedite the quest for an anti-dengue drug.","publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results suggest that NS4B modulates dengue replication via its interaction with NS3, and unveils for the first time, a role for viral genomic variations in d Dengue pathogenesis via modulation of the response to type I IFN."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":4896,"details":{"paperId":"58dae1ac97fad8b667397efb3d55bdef1329e73f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2086216487","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.00375-12","CorpusId":"8208800","PubMed":"22933295"},"title":"Trafficking and Replication Patterns Reveal Splenic Macrophages as Major Targets of Dengue Virus in Mice","abstract":"ABSTRACT Human postmortem studies of natural dengue virus (DENV) infection have reported systemically distributed viral antigen.

Virol. 82:8411–8421, 2008). Here we demonstrate that within 6 h, DENV traffics to and replicates in both CD169+ and SIGN-R1+ macrophages of the splenic marginal zone or draining lymph node, respectively, following intravenous or intrafootpad inoculation. Subsequently, high levels of replication are detected in F4/80+ splenic red pulp macrophages and in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. Intravenously inoculated mice begin to succumb to dengue disease 72 h after infection, at which time viral replication occurs systemically, except in lymphoid tissues. In particular, high levels of replication occur in CD68+ macrophages of the kidneys, heart, thymus, and gastrointestinal tract. Over the course of infection, proportionately large quantities of DENV traffic to the liver and spleen. However, late during infection, viral trafficking to the spleen decreases, while trafficking to the liver, thymus, and kidneys increases.

IL-8 production occurs in response to DENV infection, is elevated during severe dengue, is proposed to inhibit interferon, and could potentially recruit target cells to sites of infection.

Most people who recover from severe acute disease suffer from debilitating neurological sequelae, which may be due to viral persistence, infection-induced neurological cell damage, host response, or some combination of these. Acute TBFV infection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells in vitro results in the death of >95% of infected cells by day 5. However, replacing cell growth medium allows surviving cells to repopulate and become persistently infected for extended periods of time. The mechanisms responsible for initiation and maintenance of viral persistence remain vague. We subjected the HEK 293T cell transcriptome to deep sequencing to identify genes differentially expressed during acute infection and persistent infection. A total of 451 genes showed unique significant differential expression levels in persistently infected cells relative to the acute phase of infection. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis results suggested that the expression of prosurvival oncogenes AKT2 and ERBB2 was upregulated in persistently infected cells, whereas proapoptotic genes, such as Bad and the beta interferon 1 (IFN-β1) gene, were downregulated. Genes encoding antiviral cytokines such as the CCL5, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and CXCL10 genes were upregulated during the acute phase, but the same genes were relatively quiescent in persistently infected cells. Exogenous induction of apoptosis demonstrated that persistently infected cells were resistant to apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, the differential transcriptome profiles of acute-phase compared to persistently infected HEK 293T cells demonstrated an evasion of apoptosis, which may be critical for a chronic TBFV infection state. These results provide a basis for further study of the mechanisms of TBFV persistence. IMPORTANCE Tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs) cause life-threatening encephalitic disease in humans worldwide. Some people who recover from severe disease may suffer prolonged neurological symptoms due to either virus- or host response-induced cell damage or a combination of the two that are linked to viral persistence. By examining the genes that are significantly differentially expressed in acute TBFV infection versus persistent TBFV infection, we may be able to find the molecular basis of viral persistence. Here we used deep sequencing of the host cell transcriptome to discover that the expression levels of prosurvival genes were upregulated in persistently infected cells relative to acute TBFV infections whereas the expression levels of genes that promote programmed cell death were downregulated. In addition, persistently infected cells were also resistant to exogenous chemical induction of cell death, in a dose-dependent manner, compared to uninfected cells.

Polypyrimidine-tract binding protein (PTB) binds specifically to several viral IRESs. IRES-directed translation may be reduced in cell-free systems that are depleted of PTB and restored by reconstitution of lysates with recombinant PTB. However, there are no data concerning the effects of PTB on IRES-directed translation in vivo. We transfected cells with plasmids expressing dicistronic transcripts in which the upstream cistron encoded PTB or PTB deletion mutants (including a null mutant lacking amino acid residues 87 to 531). The downstream cistron encoded a reporter protein (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [CAT]) under translational control of the poliovirus IRES which was placed within the intercistronic space. In transfected BS-C-1 cells, transcripts expressing wild-type PTB produced 12-fold more reporter protein than similar transcripts encoding the PTB null mutant. There was a 2.4-fold difference in CAT produced from these transcripts in HeLa cells, which contain a greater natural abundance of PTB.

The molecular details of how the NS2A protein modulates the two distinct events have not been defined. To address this question, we have performed a systematic mutagenesis of NS2A using dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 (DENV-2) as a model. We identified two sets of NS2A mutations with distinct defects during a viral infection cycle. One set of NS2A mutations (D125A and G200A) selectively abolished viral RNA synthesis. Mechanistically, the D125A mutation abolished viral RNA synthesis through blocking the N-terminal cleavage of the NS2A protein, leading to an unprocessed NS1-NS2A protein; this result suggests that amino acid D125 (far downstream of the N terminus of NS2A) may contribute to the recognition of host protease at the NS1-NS2A junction. The other set of NS2A mutations (G11A, E20A, E100A, Q187A, and K188A) specifically impaired virion assembly without significantly affecting viral RNA synthesis. Remarkably, mutants defective in virion assembly could be rescued by supplying in trans wild-type NS2A molecules expressed from a replicative replicon, by wild-type NS2A protein expressed alone, by a mutant NS2A (G200A) that is lethal for viral RNA synthesis, or by a different mutant NS2A that is defective in virion assembly. In contrast, none of the mutants defective in viral RNA synthesis could be rescued by trans-complementation. Collectively, the results indicate that two distinct sets of NS2A molecules are responsible for DENV RNA synthesis and virion assembly. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) represents the most prevalent mosquito-borne human pathogen. Understanding the replication of DENV is essential for development of vaccines and therapeutics. Here we characterized the function of DENV-2 NS2A using a systematic mutagenesis approach. The mutagenesis results revealed two distinct sets of NS2A mutations: one set of mutations that result in defects in viral RNA synthesis and another set of mutations that result in defects in virion assembly. trans-Complementation analysis showed that mutants defective in viral RNA synthesis could not be rescued by wild-type NS2A; in contrast, mutants defective in virion assembly could be successfully rescued by wild-type NS2A or even by a mutant NS2A that is incompetent to support viral RNA synthesis. These results support a model in which two distinct sets of NS2A molecules are responsible for DENV RNA synthesis (located in the viral replication complex) and virion assembly (located in the virion assembly/budding site).

Specifically, the γδ T cell response to DV has not been characterized in detail. In this article, we demonstrate that markers of activation, proliferation, and degranulation are upregulated on γδ T cells in PBMC isolated from individuals with acute dengue fever. Primary γδ T cells responded rapidly in vitro to autologous DV-infected dendritic cells by secreting IFN-γ and upregulating CD107a. The anti-DV IFN-γ response is regulated by type I IFN and IL-18 in a TCR-independent manner, and IFN-γ secreting γδ T cells predominantly expressed IL-18Rα. Antagonizing the ATP-dependent P2X7 receptor pathway of inflammasome activation significantly inhibited the anti-DV IFN-γ response of γδ T cells. Overnight priming with IL-18 produced effector γδ T cells with significantly increased ability to lyse autologous DV-infected dendritic cells. Monocytes were identified as accessory cells that augmented the anti-DV IFN-γ response of γδ T cells.

Development of an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of appropriate small animal models; mice are naturally not susceptible to DENV and only become infected if highly immunocompromised. Mouse models lacking both type I and type II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG129 mice) or the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR−/− mice) are susceptible to infection with mouse-adapted DENV strains but are severely impaired in mounting functional immune responses to the virus and thus are of limited use for study. Here we used conditional deletion of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) on individual immune cell subtypes to generate a minimally manipulated mouse model that is susceptible to DENV while retaining global immune competence. Mice lacking IFNAR expression on CD11c+ dendritic cells and LysM+ macrophages succumbed completely to DENV infection, while mice deficient in the receptor on either CD11c+ or LysM+ cells were susceptible to infection but often resolved viremia and recovered fully from infection. Conditional IFNAR mice responded with a swift and strong CD8+ T-cell response to viral infection, compared to a weak response in IFNAR−/− mice. Furthermore, mice lacking IFNAR on either CD11c+ or LysM+ cells were also sufficiently immunocompetent to raise a protective immune response to a candidate subunit vaccine against DENV-2. These data demonstrate that mice with conditional deficiencies in expression of the IFNAR represent improved models for the study of DENV immunology and screening of vaccine candidates. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus infects 400 million people every year worldwide, causing 100 million clinically apparent infections, which can be fatal if untreated. Despite many years of research, there are no effective vaccine and no antiviral treatment available for dengue. Development of vaccines has been hampered in particular by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Mouse models used to test dengue vaccine are deficient in interferon (IFN) type I signaling and severely immunocompromised and therefore likely not ideal for the testing of vaccines. In this study, we explored alternative models lacking the IFN receptor only on certain cell types.

These extracellular virions were distributed adjacent to the virus-bearing RER and were presumably released virions. Vertical transmission of the virus was evident in mitotic lymphoblasts.

Here, functional elements of the dengue virus (DENV) capsid (C) protein were investigated. Study of the N-terminal region of DENV C has been limited by the presence of overlapping cis-acting RNA elements within the protein-coding region. To dissociate these two functions, we used a recombinant DENV RNA with a duplication of essential RNA structures outside the C coding sequence. By the use of this system, the highly conserved amino acids FNML, which are encoded in the RNA cyclization sequence 5′CS, were found to be dispensable for C function. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 18 amino acids of C impaired DENV particle formation. Two clusters of basic residues (R5-K6-K7-R9 and K17-R18-R20-R22) were identified as important. A systematic mutational analysis indicated that a high density of positive charges, rather than particular residues at specific positions, was necessary. Furthermore, a differential requirement of N-terminal sequences of C for viral particle assembly was observed in mosquito and human cells. While no viral particles were observed in human cells with a virus lacking the first 18 residues of C, DENV propagation was detected in mosquito cells, although to a level about 50-fold less than that observed for a wild-type (WT) virus. We conclude that basic residues at the N terminus of C are necessary for efficient particle formation in mosquito cells but that they are crucial for propagation in human cells. This is the first report demonstrating that the N terminus of C plays a role in DENV particle formation. In addition, our results suggest that this function of C is differentially modulated in different host cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is concluded that basic residues at the N terminus of C are necessary for efficient particle formation in mosquito cells but that they are crucial for propagation in human cells."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7818,"details":{"paperId":"f3268a9f1709817a831833f15339169dafe831e3","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"6356745","MAG":"2911135869","DOI":"10.3390/v11010068","CorpusId":"58541240","PubMed":"30650657"},"title":"Uncovering Flavivirus Host Dependency Factors through a Genome-Wide Gain-of-Function Screen","abstract":"Flaviviruses, such as dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), yellow fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, are mosquito-borne pathogens that present a major risk to global public health.

Whether they have a biological function, such as host immune protection against related viruses, is a field of intense study. Here, we investigated the repertoire of endogenous flaviviral elements (EFVEs) in Aedes mosquitoes, the vectors of arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses. Previous studies identified three EFVEs from Aedes albopictus cell lines and one from Aedes aegypti cell lines. However, an in-depth characterization of EFVEs in wild-type mosquito populations and individual mosquitoes in vivo has not been performed. We detected the full-length DNA sequence of the previously described EFVEs and their respective transcripts in several A. albopictus and A. aegypti populations from geographically distinct areas. However, EFVE-derived proteins were not detected by mass spectrometry. Using deep sequencing, we detected the production of PIWI-interacting RNA-like small RNAs, in an antisense orientation, targeting the EFVEs and their flanking regions in vivo. The EFVEs were integrated in repetitive regions of the mosquito genomes, and their flanking sequences varied among mosquito populations. We bioinformatically predicted several new EFVEs from a Vietnamese A. albopictus population and observed variation in the occurrence of those elements among mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis of an A. aegypti EFVE suggested that it integrated prior to the global expansion of the species and subsequently diverged among and within populations. The findings of this study together reveal the substantial structural and nucleotide diversity of flaviviral integrations in Aedes genomes. Unraveling this diversity will help to elucidate the potential biological function of these EFVEs. IMPORTANCE Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are whole or partial viral sequences integrated in host genomes. Interestingly, some EVEs have important functions for host fitness and antiviral defense. Because mosquitoes also have EVEs in their genomes, characterizing these EVEs is a prerequisite for their potential use to manipulate the mosquito antiviral response. In the study described here, we focused on EVEs related to the Flavivirus genus, to which dengue and Zika viruses belong, in individual Aedes mosquitoes from geographically distinct areas. We show the existence in vivo of flaviviral EVEs previously identified in mosquito cell lines, and we detected new ones. We show that EVEs have evolved differently in each mosquito population. They produce transcripts and small RNAs but not proteins, suggesting a function at the RNA level. Our study uncovers the diverse repertoire of flaviviral EVEs in Aedes mosquito populations and contributes to an understanding of their role in the host antiviral system.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The existence in vivo of flaviviral EVEs previously identified in mosquito cell lines are shown, and it is shown that EVEs have evolved differently in each mosquito population, suggesting a function at the RNA level."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":3229,"details":{"paperId":"cfea5beaba935a1f13ed11c145029e17a9eb739f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4498383","MAG":"2263522335","DOI":"10.1038/srep10592","CorpusId":"17549028","PubMed":"26161501"},"title":"Understanding Dengue Virus Capsid Protein Interaction with Key Biological Targets","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":7768,"details":{"paperId":"2ca412fe9d23991d973dc8d65ddfcbb77c8de399","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7168633","MAG":"2996811786","DOI":"10.3390/pathogens9010042","CorpusId":"210700394","PubMed":"31948047"},"title":"Understanding Flavivirus Capsid Protein Functions: The Tip of the Iceberg","abstract":"Flaviviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA arboviruses, infectious to humans and many other animals and are transmitted primarily via tick or mosquito vectors.

It is known that capsid dimers interact with the membrane of lipid droplets, aiding in both viral packaging and storage of capsid prior to packaging.

Capsid may interact with host RNAs, resulting in altered RNA splicing and RNA transcription. Capsid may also bind short interfering-RNAs and has been proposed to sequester these species to protect flaviviruses from the invertebrate siRNA pathways. Capsid can also be found in the nucleolus, where it wreaks havoc on ribosome biogenesis.

Detailed thermodynamic analysis indicated that the two endothermic peaks separated with an increasing protein concentration, and global fitting of the DSC curves strongly suggested the presence of unfolded tetramers at temperatures around 80-90 °C, which dissociated to unfolded monomers at even higher temperatures.

In this study we have shown that dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) infection significantly induced viperin, co-incident with production of viral RNA and via a mechanism requiring retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Viperin did not inhibit DENV-2 entry but DENV-2 RNA and infectious virus release was inhibited in viperin expressing cells. Conversely, DENV-2 replicated to higher tires earlier in viperin shRNA expressing cells. The anti-DENV effect of viperin was mediated by residues within the C-terminal 17 amino acids of viperin and did not require the N-terminal residues, including the helix domain, leucine zipper and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) motifs known to be involved in viperin intracellular membrane association. Viperin showed co-localisation with lipid droplet markers, and was co-localised and interacted with DENV-2 capsid (CA), NS3 and viral RNA. The ability of viperin to interact with DENV-2 NS3 was associated with its anti-viral activity, while co-localisation of viperin with lipid droplets was not. Thus, DENV-2 infection induces viperin which has anti-viral properties residing in the C-terminal region of the protein that act to restrict early DENV-2 RNA production/accumulation, potentially via interaction of viperin with DENV-2 NS3 and replication complexes.

We describe here a novel flavivirus inhibition mechanism that results in interferon-mediated obstruction of tick-borne encephalitis virus particle assembly and involves release of malfunctioning membrane-associated capsid (C) particles. This mechanism is controlled by the activity of the interferon-induced protein viperin, a broad-spectrum antiviral interferon-stimulated gene. Through analysis of the viperin-interactome, we identified the Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) as the cellular protein targeted by viperin. Viperin-induced antiviral activity, as well as C-particle release, was stimulated by GBF1 inhibition and knockdown and reduced by elevated levels of GBF1. Our results suggest that viperin targets flavivirus virulence by inducing the secretion of unproductive noninfectious virus particles via a GBF1-dependent mechanism. This as-yet-undescribed antiviral mechanism allows potential therapeutic intervention. IMPORTANCE The interferon response can target viral infection on almost every level; however, very little is known about the interference of flavivirus assembly. We show here that interferon, through the action of viperin, can disturb the assembly of tick-borne encephalitis virus. The viperin protein is highly induced after viral infection and exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, the mechanism of action is still elusive and appears to vary between the different viruses, indicating that cellular targets utilized by several viruses might be involved. In this study, we show that viperin induces capsid particle release by interacting and inhibiting the function of the cellular protein Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1).

Unfortunately, very little is known about the biology of these factors, and how they orchestrate these differences.

We demonstrate here that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a ligand for PS receptors, and that PE plays a key role in apoptotic cell clearance and infection of various pathogenic viruses, including West Nile, dengue, and Ebola viruses. This finding provides significant insights; it clarifies how PS receptors promote viral infection, suggests PE is a useful broad-spectrum antiviral target, and deepens our understanding of apoptosis and the process by which apoptotic cells are cleared. Phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors contribute to two crucial biological processes: apoptotic clearance and entry of many enveloped viruses. In both cases, they recognize PS exposed on the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a ligand for PS receptors and that this phospholipid mediates phagocytosis and viral entry. We show that a subset of PS receptors, including T-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) mucin domain protein 1 (TIM1), efficiently bind PE. We further show that PE is present in the virions of flaviviruses and filoviruses, and that the PE-specific cyclic peptide lantibiotic agent Duramycin efficiently inhibits the entry of West Nile, dengue, and Ebola viruses. The inhibitory effect of Duramycin is specific: it inhibits TIM1-mediated, but not L-SIGN-mediated, virus infection, and it does so by blocking virus attachment to TIM1. We further demonstrate that PE is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells, and promotes their phagocytic uptake by TIM1-expressing cells.

Sequence comparisons of parent and passage variants revealed five GAG-binding determinants, which all cluster in a surface-exposed region in domain II of the three-dimensional structure of the DEN envelope protein. Using an infectious cDNA clone of NGC and an NGC/PUO-218 prM-E chimeric clone, it was demonstrated that the GAG-binding determinants augment the specific infectivity for BHK-21 and/or SW13 cells by 10- to 170-fold and in some cases marginally reduce that for Vero cells. This altered cell tropism was due to a greater dependence of the variants on cell surface GAG for attachment/entry, given their increased susceptibility to heparin inhibition. The effect of the GAG-binding determinants on virulence was examined in mice deficient in alpha/beta/gamma interferon responses. High GAG affinity strongly correlated with low neuroinvasiveness due to rapid virus clearance from the blood. It was speculated that this mechanism accounts for the attenuation in primates of some DEN vaccine candidates. Interestingly, the GAG-binding variants did not display marked attenuation of neurovirulence and the opposing effect of enhanced neurovirulence was associated with one determinant (Lys126) already present in mouse brain-adapted NGC.

Yet, there are currently no biomarkers to predict disease progression. We profiled the landscape of host transcripts and viral RNA in thousands of single blood cells from dengue patients prior to progressing to SD. We discovered cell type-specific immune activation and candidate predictive biomarkers. We also determined preferential virus association with specific cell populations, particularly naive B cells and monocytes. We explored immune activation of bystander cells, clonality and somatic evolution of adaptive immune repertoires, as well as viral genomics. This multifaceted approach could advance understanding of pathogenesis of any viral infection, map an atlas of infected cells, and promote the development of prognostics. Dengue virus (DENV) infection can result in severe complications. However, the understanding of the molecular correlates of severity is limited, partly due to difficulties in defining the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that contain DENV RNA in vivo. Accordingly, there are currently no biomarkers predictive of progression to severe dengue (SD). Bulk transcriptomics data are difficult to interpret because blood consists of multiple cell types that may react differently to infection. Here, we applied virus-inclusive single-cell RNA-seq approach (viscRNA-Seq) to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single PBMCs derived early in the course of disease from six dengue patients and four healthy controls and to characterize distinct leukocyte subtypes that harbor viral RNA (vRNA). Multiple IFN response genes, particularly MX2 in naive B cells and CD163 in CD14+ CD16+ monocytes, were up-regulated in a cell-specific manner before progression to SD. The majority of vRNA-containing cells in the blood of two patients who progressed to SD were naive IgM B cells expressing the CD69 and CXCR4 receptors and various antiviral genes, followed by monocytes. Bystander, non-vRNA–containing B cells also demonstrated immune activation, and IgG1 plasmablasts from two patients exhibited clonal expansions. Lastly, assembly of the DENV genome sequence revealed diversity at unexpected sites.

ABSTRACT Infection with dengue virus (DENV) induces vast rearrangements of the endoplasmic reticulum, which allows the compartmentalization of viral RNA replication and particle assembly. Both processes occur in concert with viral and cellular proteins. Prior studies from our group suggest that the host RNA-binding protein (RBP) Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) is required for a late step in the DENV replication cycle. Here we report that YBX1 interacts with the viral nucleocapsid, distributes to DENV assembly sites and is required for efficient assembly of intracellular infectious virions and their secretion. Genetic ablation of YBX1 decreased the spatial proximity between capsid and envelope, increased the susceptibility of envelope to proteinase K mediated degradation, resulted in the formation of rough empty-looking particles, and decreased the secretion of viral particles. We propose a model wherein YBX1 enables the interaction between the viral nucleocapsid with the structural protein E, which is required for proper assembly of intracellular virus particles and their secretion.

In summary, we define molecular requirements for Zika virus sfRNA accumulation and provide new ideas of how flavivirus RNA structures have evolved to succeed in different hosts. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus, mainly transmitted by mosquitoes, which represents a global health threat. A common feature of flavivirus-infected cells is the accumulation of viral noncoding subgenomic RNAs by partial degradation of the viral genome, known as sfRNAs, involved in immune evasion and pathogenesis. Although great effort is being made to understand the mechanism by which these sfRNAs function during infection, the picture of how they work is still incomplete. In this study, we developed new genetic tools to dissect the functions of ZIKV RNA structures for viral replication and sfRNA production in mosquito and human hosts. ZIKV infections mostly accumulate two kinds of sfRNAs, sfRNA1 and sfRNA2, by stalling genome degradation upstream of duplicated stem loops (SLI and SLII) of the viral 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Although the two SLs share conserved sequences and structures, different functions have been found for ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. While both SLs are enhancers for viral infection in human cells, they play opposite roles in the mosquito host. The dissection of determinants for sfRNA formation indicated a strong cooperativity between SLI and SLII, supporting a high-order organization of this region of the 3′ UTR. Using recombinant ZIKV with different SLI and SLII arrangements, which produce different types of sfRNAs or lack the ability to generate these molecules, revealed that at least one sfRNA was necessary for efficient infection and transmission in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Importantly, we demonstrate an absolute requirement of sfRNAs for ZIKV propagation in human cells. In this regard, viruses lacking sfRNAs, constructed by deletion of the region containing SLI and SLII, were able to infect human cells but the infection was rapidly cleared by antiviral responses. Our findings are unique for ZIKV, since in previous studies, other flaviviruses with deletions of analogous regions of the genome, including dengue and West Nile viruses, accumulated distinct species of sfRNAs and were infectious in human cells. We conclude that flaviviruses share common strategies for sfRNA generation, but they have evolved mechanisms to produce different kinds of these RNAs to accomplish virus-specific functions.

Fearsome flaviviruses Although it was identified more than half a century ago, Zika virus’s impact on unborn children of infected pregnant women was only detected in the recent epidemic. Unfortunately, Zika virus may not be unique in its ability to afflict fetal damage. To investigate this possibility, Platt and colleagues infected pregnant immunocompetent mice with related viruses. Two other flaviruses, West Nile virus and Powassan virus, caused fetal demise. These viruses could also replicate in human maternal and fetal explant tissue. If these or other neurotropic flaviviruses take off in the human population, then we may again experience congenital infections with devastating effects. Although Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women can cause placental damage, intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, and fetal demise, these disease manifestations only became apparent in the context of a large epidemic in the Americas. We hypothesized that ZIKV is not unique among arboviruses in its ability to cause congenital infection. To evaluate this, we tested the capacity of four emerging arboviruses [West Nile virus (WNV), Powassan virus (POWV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Mayaro virus (MAYV)] from related (flavivirus) and unrelated (alphavirus) genera to infect the placenta and fetus in immunocompetent, wild-type mice. Although all four viruses caused placental infection, only infection with the neurotropic flaviviruses (WNV and POWV) resulted in fetal demise. WNV and POWV also replicated efficiently in second-trimester human maternal (decidua) and fetal (chorionic villi and fetal membrane) explants, whereas CHIKV and MAYV replicated less efficiently. In mice, RNA in situ hybridization and histopathological analysis revealed that WNV infected the placenta and fetal central nervous system, causing injury to the developing brain. In comparison, CHIKV and MAYV did not cause substantive placental or fetal damage despite evidence of vertical transmission.

Zinc has a necessary role in the replication of many viruses, however, antiviral action of zinc has also been demonstrated in in vitro infection models most likely through induction of host antiviral responses. Therefore, depending on the host machinery that the virus employs at different stages of infection, zinc may either facilitate, or inhibit virus infection. In this study, we show that zinc plays divergent roles in rotavirus and dengue virus infections in epithelial cells. Dengue virus infection did not perturb the epithelial barrier functions despite the release of virus from the basolateral surface whereas rotavirus infection led to disruption of epithelial junctions. In rotavirus infection, zinc supplementation post-infection did not block barrier disruption suggesting that zinc does not affect rotavirus life-cycle or protects epithelial barriers post-infection suggesting the involvement of cellular pathways in the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in enteric infections. Zinc depletion by N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) inhibited dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection but had no effect on rotavirus. Time-of-addition experiments suggested that zinc chelation affected both early and late stages of dengue virus infectious cycle and zinc chelation abrogated dengue virus RNA replication.

ABSTRACT Zinc-finger protein 36, CCCH type-like 1 (ZFP36L1), containing tandem CCCH-type zinc-finger motifs with an RNA-binding property, plays an important role in cellular RNA metabolism mainly by RNA decay pathways. Recently, we demonstrated that human ZFP36L1 has potent antiviral activity against influenza A virus infection. However, its role in the host defense response against flaviviruses has not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that ZFP36L1 functions as a host innate defender against flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV). Overexpression of ZFP36L1 reduced JEV and DENV infection, and ZFP36L1 knockdown enhanced viral replication. ZFP36L1 destabilized the JEV genome by targeting and degrading viral RNA mediated by both 5′-3′ XRN1 and 3′-5′ RNA-exosome RNA decay pathways. Mutation in both zinc-finger motifs of ZFP36L1 disrupted RNA-binding and antiviral activity. Furthermore, the viral RNA sequences specifically recognized by ZFP36L1 were mapped to the 3′-untranslated region of the JEV genome with the AU-rich element (AUUUA) motif.

However, the antiviral potential of ZFP36L1 against flaviviruses has not yet been fully demonstrated. Here, we reveal the antiviral potential of human ZFP36L1 against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV). ZFP36L1 specifically targeted the ARE motif within viral RNA and triggered the degradation of viral RNA transcripts via cellular degrading enzymes 5′-3′ XRN1 and 3′-5′ RNA exosome.

ABSTRACT Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV)/West Nile Virus (WNV)-induced encephalitis, although observed in selective cases, is associated with fatal consequences ranging from decline in cognitive abilities among recovered patients to coma/death. Loss of neuronal cells following viral infection-induced neuronal death imposes significant challenge to the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis eventually resulting in loss of CNS tissue integrity and poor disease outcome in patients.

Upon its upregulation, miR-451a has been demonstrated to target 3′-UTR of 14-3-3ζ transcript culminating into downregulation of 14-3-3ζ at the protein level. In response to 14-3-3ζ protein depletion in the cytosol upon flavivirus infection, increased phosphorylation of JNK protein has been shown to take place thus paving way for the cell to undergo apoptosis. Reversal of virus-induced miR-451a-upregulation helped abrogate neuronal apoptosis which is accompanied by a restoration of 14-3-3ζ protein and phosphorylated-JNK abundance to its normal level.

The results indicate an overexpression of miR-927 in C6-L57 cells and acutely infected cells according to the time of infection and the m.o.i. used. The downregulation of miR-927 in C6-L57 cells results in a reduction of both viral titre and viral genome copy number. The overexpression of miR-927 in C6-L40 and C6/36 cells infected at an m.o.i. of 0.1 causes an increase in both viral titre and viral genome copy number, suggesting a pro-viral activity of miR-927. In silico prediction analysis reveals target mRNAs for miR-927 are implicated in post-translational modifications (SUMO), translation factors (eIF-2B), the innate immune system (NKIRAS), exocytosis (EXOC-2), endocytosis (APM1) and the cytoskeleton (FLN). The expression levels of FLN were the most affected by both miR-927 overexpression and inhibition, and FLN was determined to be a direct target of miR-927 by a dual-luciferase gene reporter assay. FLN has been associated with the regulation of the Toll pathway and either overexpression or downregulation of miR-927 resulted in expression changes of antimicrobial peptides (Cecropins A and G, and Defensin D) involved in the Toll pathway response.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results indicate an overexpression of miR-927 in C6-L57 cells and acutely infected cells according to the time of infection and the m.o.i. of 0.1 causes an increase in both viral titre and viral genome copy number, suggesting a pro-viral activity of miDengue virus."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":1164,"details":{"paperId":"731f1ce417c413aab4fa4c7924c9065f11dee332","externalIds":{"MAG":"2597497759","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.03.020","CorpusId":"46843691","PubMed":"28365456"},"title":"miR‐21 promotes dengue virus serotype 2 replication in HepG2 cells","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results show that miR‐21 promotes DENV 2 replication in HepG2 cells, and this mechanism could serve as a possible therapeutic intervention point."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":146,"details":{"paperId":"484748fe6261aaf6b9512b7e42d51ca7c648b673","externalIds":{"MAG":"2120800168","DOI":"10.1002/jmv.23815","CorpusId":"30150337","PubMed":"25025105"},"title":"miR‐252 of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus regulates dengue virus replication by suppressing the expression of the dengue virus envelope protein","abstract":"The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus is a major vector of dengue in mainland China. Dengue epidemics have spread from the southern coastal regions to the relatively northern and western regions since 1990s. Dengue has become an emerging public health problem in the southern coastal regions. microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non‐coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post‐transcriptional level. A highly abundant miRNA, miR‐252, was induced more than threefold after dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV‐2) infection in the Ae. albopictus C6/36 cell line. Transfection with miR‐252 inhibitor resulted in the increase of DENV‐2 RNA copies and the up‐regulation of DENV‐2 envelop protein (E protein) expression, whereas over expression of miR‐252 with its mimic decreased DENV RNA copies and the down‐regulation of E protein expression.

The mosquito innate immune response is a primary determinant for arthropod-borne virus transmission, and the midgut is the first barrier to pathogen transmission. Mosquito antiviral immunity is primarily mediated by the small interfering RNA pathway. However, the roles that the P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway play in antiviral immunity in Ae. albopictus and its midgut still need further exploration. This study aimed to explore the profiles of both viral-derived and host-originated piRNAs in the whole body and midgut infected with Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) in Ae. albopictus, and to elucidate gene expression profile differences of the PIWI protein family between adult females and their midguts. A deep sequencing-based method was used to identify and analyze small non-coding RNAs, especially the piRNA profiles in DENV-2-infected Ae. albopictus and its midgut. The top-ranked, differentially-expressed piRNAs were further validated using Stem-loop qRT-PCR. Bioinformatics analyses and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) methods were used to detect PIWI protein family members, and their expression profiles. DENV-2 derived piRNAs (vpiRNA, 24–30 nts) were observed in both infected Ae. albopictus and its midgut; however, only vpiRNA in the whole-body library had a weak preference for adenine at position 10 (10A) in the sense molecules as a feature of secondary piRNA. These vpiRNAs were not equally distributed, instead they were derived from a few specific regions of the genome, especially several hot spots, and displayed an obvious positive strand bias. We refer to the differentially expressed host piRNAs after DENV infection as virus-induced host endogenous piRNAs (vepiRNAs). However, we found that vepiRNAs were abundant in mosquito whole-body tissue, but deficient in the midgut. A total of eleven PIWI family genes were identified in Ae. albopictus; however, only AalPiwi5–7 and AalAgo3(1–2) were readily detected in the midgut. The characteristics of piRNAs in DENV-2-infected Ae. albopictus adult females were similar to those previously described for flavivirus infections but were not observed in the midgut. The reduced levels of vepiRNAs and incomplete expression of PIWI pathway genes in midgut samples from DENV-2-infected Ae. albopictus suggests that viral regulation of host piRNAs may not be an important factor in the midgut.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study aimed to explore the profiles of both viral-derived and host-originated piRNAs in the whole body and midgut infected with Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) in Ae."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":5213,"details":{"paperId":"7ff7ea35688673e56275cd6bdbc3b8d809128c17","externalIds":{"MAG":"2121324210","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.73.11.9247-9255.1999","CorpusId":"25681519","PubMed":"10516033"},"title":"trans-Complementation Analysis of the Flavivirus Kunjin ns5 Gene Reveals an Essential Role for Translation of Its N-Terminal Half in RNA Replication","abstract":"ABSTRACT Recently we described rescue of defective Kunjin virus (KUN) RNAs with small deletions in the methyltransferase and RNA polymerase motifs of the ns5 gene, using BHK cells stably expressing KUN replicon RNA (repBHK cells) as helper (A.

A. Khromykh and E. G. Westaway, J. Virol. 71:1497–1505, 1997]) was used for rescue and propagation of KUN viruses defective in the RNA polymerase gene (NS5). A new infectious full-length KUN virus cDNA clone, FLSDX, prepared from our previously described cDNA clone pAKUN (A. A. Khromykh and E. G. Westaway, J. Virol. 68:4580–4588, 1994) and possessing ∼105-fold higher specific infectivity than that of pAKUN, was used for preparation of defective mutants. Deletions of the predicted RNA polymerase motif GDD (producing FLdGDD) and of one of the predicted methyltransferase motifs (S-adenosylmethionine [SAM] binding site, producing FLdSAM) were introduced separately into FLSDX. Transcription and transfection of FLdGDD and FLdSAM RNAs into repBHK cells but not into normal BHK cells resulted in their replication and the recovery of defective viruses able to replicate only in repBHK cells. Reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing analyses showed retention of the introduced deletions in the genomes of the recovered viruses. Retention of these deletions, as well as our inability to recover viruses able to replicate in normal BHK cells after prolonged incubation (for 7 days) of FLdGDD- or FLdSAM-transfected repBHK cells, excluded the possibility that recombination had occurred between the deleted defective NS5 genes present in transfected RNAs and the functional NS5 gene present in the repBHK cells. An RNA with a point mutation in the GDD motif (FLGVD) was also complemented in transfected repBHK cells, and defective virus was recovered by day 3 after transfection. However, in contrast to the results with FLdGDD and FLdSAM RNAs, prolonged (4 days or more) incubation of FLGVD RNA in normal BHK cells allowed recovery of a virus in which theGVD mutation had reverted via a single base change to the wild-type GDD sequence. Overall, these results represent the first demonstration of trans-complementation of defective flavivirus RNAs with deleterious deletions in the flavivirus RNA polymerase gene NS5.

Integrins were previously postulated to be involved in flavivirus entry and to modulate flavivirus replication efficiency. In the present study, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), lacking the expression of αVβ3 integrin (MEF-αVβ3−/−), were infected with four different flaviviruses, namely yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV) and Langat virus (LGTV). The effects of the αVβ3 integrin absence in double-knockout MEF-αVβ3−/− on flavivirus binding, internalization and replication were compared to the respective wild-type cells. Binding to the cell surface for all four flaviviruses was not affected by the ablation of αVβ3 integrin, whereas internalization of USUV and WNV was slightly affected by the loss of αVβ3 integrin expression. Most interestingly, the deletion of αVβ3 integrin strongly impaired replication of all flaviviruses with a reduction of up to 99% on virus yields and a strong reduction on flavivirus anti-genome RNA synthesis.
