COVID-19 patients develop severe hypoxemia early in the course of the disease, which is silent most of the time. Small fibrinous thrombi in pulmonary arterioles and a tumefaction of endothelial were observed in the autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases. Studies showed that the viral infection induces a vascular process in the lung, which included vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Further, the proportions of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes were strongly reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estradiol is connected with CD4+ T cell numbers and increases T-reg cell populations, affecting immune responses to infection. It is known that estradiol exerts a protective effect on endothelial function, activating the generation of nitric oxide (NO) via endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Estrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia. It exerts a variety of rapid actions, which are initiated after its coupling with membrane receptors, which in turn, may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flow. Direct and indirect mechanisms underlying the effects of estradiol were investigated, and the results point to a possible protective effect of estradiol against COVID-19, indicating that it may be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic element for the treatment of patients affected by the novel coronavirus.\n","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results point to a possible protective effect of estradiol against COVID-19, indicating that it may be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic element for the treatment of patients affected by the novel coronavirus."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1188,"details":{"paperId":"c21e739d1d43ed6aeade61dfc9c177939ad89ec8","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7115508","MAG":"1993139310","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2011.09.005","CorpusId":"6319008","PubMed":"21925774"},"title":"2,6-Bis-arylmethyloxy-5-hydroxychromones with antiviral activity against both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and SARS-associated coronavirus (SCV)","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"5-hydroxychromones, a bioisosteric alternative scaffold of the antiviral aryl diketoacids, showed anti-HCV activity and, depending on the aromatic substituents on the 2-arylmethyloxy moiety, some of the derivatives were also active against SCV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2505,"details":{"paperId":"628697acccd82ac683d8c26b187dedd8ac94852b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7431750","MAG":"3059166130","DOI":"10.1038/s41422-020-00398-1","CorpusId":"221146053","PubMed":"32811977"},"title":"25-Hydroxycholesterol is a potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The present study monitored the clinical development and 25HC kinetics in the serum of a 73-year-old female COVID-19 patient from Shiyan, Hubei province and determined the serum concentration of 25HC in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 mice."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1806,"details":{"paperId":"a75fe2843504c6fe2e799bf6a2715a21ed5bf418","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7128271","MAG":"3012953808","DOI":"10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104779","CorpusId":"214756640","PubMed":"32247821"},"title":"3CLpro inhibitors as a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19: Available evidence and ongoing clinical trials","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3715,"details":{"paperId":"c4c74758980b642a88f7afcd3ca4e8c79bb84521","externalIds":{"MAG":"3015306417","DOI":"10.1101/2020.04.07.030445","CorpusId":"229162242"},"title":"3D Models of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggest challenges and opportunities for vaccine development","abstract":"Here we have generated 3D structures of glycoforms of the spike (S) protein SARS-CoV-2, based on reported 3D structures for the S protein and on reported glycomics data for the protein produced in HEK293 cells.

Ivermectin also exhibited significant binding affinity\nwith different SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs) which\nhave diverse functions in virus life cycle. Significant binding of Ivermectin with\nRdRp indicate its role in the inhibition of the viral replication and\nultimately impeding the multiplication of the virus.

Several vaccines have been designed based on natural or designed protein scaffolds, which exhibited a potent adaptive immune response to antigens; however, antibodies are also generated against the scaffold, which may impair subsequent vaccination. In order to compare polypeptide scaffolds of different size and oligomerization state with respect to their efficiency, including anti-scaffold immunity, we compared several strategies of presentation of the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, an antigen aiming to generate neutralizing antibodies. A comparison of several genetic fusions of RBD to different nanoscaffolding domains (foldon, ferritin, lumazine synthase, and β-annulus peptide) delivered as DNA plasmids demonstrated a strongly augmented immune response, with high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a robust T-cell response in mice.

As a new virus, not previously in the human population, but with similarities to other coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS/ARDS), and no known treatments, the race to re-purpose existing drugs and to enlist novel therapeutics is underway. In the half-year since the first cases, we have acquired substantial knowledge of this virus and the clinical course of COVID-19 progression. Results from early clinical trials have revealed two treatments (remdesivir, dexamethasone) that mitigate disease progression but clearly, there is much room for improvement. Initial case reports indicated many succumb to COVID-19 of hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS. However, ensuing studies revealed an atypical, immune cell-sequestered, vasculature-inflamed state leading to multiorgan thrombotic complications and end organ failure likely due to hyperinflammatory host responses. This Perspective focuses on a potential mechanism for a key COVID-19 disease progression turning point related to vascular and airway inflammation. The leukotriene lipid mediators have been overlooked with discussion centering on cytokine storms unleashing the deadly form of COVID-19. Leukotrienes possess some of the most potent known activities on immune cell trafficking and vascular leakage. We offer a simple treatment paradigm using two generic drugs targeting the hyperinflammatory response that characterizes the turning point from mild to severe/critical COVID-19 by targeting leukotriene biosynthesis with zileuton (Zyflo® controlled release formulation) and antagonism of the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor with montelukast (Singulair®).","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A simple treatment paradigm using two generic drugs targeting the hyperinflammatory response that characterizes the turning point from mild to severe/critical COVID-19 by targeting leukotriene biosynthesis with zileuton and antagonism of the cysteinyl leukOTriene 1 receptor with montelukast (Singulair®)."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6282,"details":{"paperId":"c81c4a99012d59972ec0e8d5fa4e939dffea1565","externalIds":{"MAG":"3037426855","DOI":"10.4049/jimmunol.2000583","CorpusId":"220121546","PubMed":"32591393"},"title":"A Potently Neutralizing Antibody Protects Mice against SARS-CoV-2 Infection","abstract":"Key Points Generation and screening of anti–SARS-CoV-2 RBD mAbs reveal a potently protective Ab. mAb 2B04 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. mAb 2B04 protects mice from morbidity in a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to early or late favipiravir therapy (in the latter case, the same regimen starting on day 6 instead of day 1). The primary endpoint was viral clearance by day 6. The secondary endpoint was change in viral load by day 6. Exploratory endpoints included time to defervescence and resolution of symptoms. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 69 were virologically evaluable. Viral clearance occurred within 6 days in 66.7% and 56.1% of the early and late treatment groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.76 to 2.62).

During therapy, 84.1% developed transient hyperuricemia. Favipiravir did not significantly improve viral clearance as measured by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) by day 6 but was associated with numerical reduction in time to defervescence.

Inhibition of this vital proteolytic process is effective in preventing the virus from replicating in infected cells and therefore provides a potential COVID‐19 treatment option. Guided by previous medicinal chemistry studies about SARS‐CoV‐1 main protease (SC1MPro), we have designed and synthesized a series of SC2MPro inhibitors that contain β‐(S‐2‐oxopyrrolidin‐3‐yl)‐alaninal (Opal) for the formation of a reversible covalent bond with the SC2MPro active‐site cysteine C145. All inhibitors display high potency with Ki values at or below 100 nM. The most potent compound, MPI3, has as a Ki value of 8.3 nM. Crystallographic analyses of SC2MPro bound to seven inhibitors indicated both formation of a covalent bond with C145 and structural rearrangement from the apoenzyme to accommodate the inhibitors. Virus inhibition assays revealed that several inhibitors have high potency in inhibiting the SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytopathogenic effect in both Vero E6 and A549/ACE2 cells. Two inhibitors, MPI5 and MPI8, completely prevented the SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytopathogenic effect in Vero E6 cells at 2.5–5 μM and A549/ACE2 cells at 0.16–0.31 μM.

However, most published studies of these diseases were case series and retrospective comparisons of treated and nontreated individuals. Consistent with this, several uncontrolled case series of convalescent plasma use in patients with coronavirus disease (2019) COVID-19 have suggested a possible benefit.4-6 Given encouraging historical precedents and the absence of proven SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) antiviral therapies, convalescent plasma therapy has been proposed as a treatment option for COVID-19.7 The availability of clinical information generated from randomized clinical trials is therefore of substantial importance given that the world remains in the grip of the COVID-19 epidemic and convalescent plasma is currently in use in many countries, including the US. In their article in JAMA, Li et al8 present findings from the first randomized clinical trial of convalescent plasma therapy for patients with COVID-19 conducted in China. In contrast to most other reports of convalescent plasma use in past epidemics, this study is noteworthy in that it used a randomized trial design and well-characterized plasma units with a high titer of antibody to SARS-CoV-2. It was an important accomplishment to conduct a carefully controlled trial during a pandemic with an entirely new highly contagious disease that stressed health systems in an unprecedented way. However, the authors report that because the COVID-19 outbreak in China was being contained while the trial was ongoing and new cases were unavailable for enrollment, the trial was terminated before it reached its targeted original sample size of 200 patients; only 103 were enrolled (for whom randomization was stratified by disease severity). Consequently, the study was underpowered and many comparisons between the convalescent plasma group and the control group were not statistically significant. In the primary analysis, based on 52 patients who were randomized to receive convalescent plasma in addition to standard treatment and 51 patients who were randomized to receive standard treatment alone (control), the primary outcome of time to clinical improvement within 28 days (defined as being discharged alive or having a reduction of 2 points on a 6-point disease severity scale) was 2.15 days shorter (95% CI, −5.28 to 0.99 days) in the intervention group compared with the control group, and clinical improvement at 28 days occurred in 27 patients (51.9%) in the intervention group vs 22 patients (43.1%) in the control group (difference, 8.8%; 95% CI, −10.4% to 28%; hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.79-2.49]; P = .26). In analyses stratified by disease severity, among patients with severe disease (23 in the convalescent plasma group and 22 in the control group), time to clinical improvement within 28 days was 4.94 days shorter (95% CI, −9.33 to −0.54 days) in the intervention group compared with the control group, and clinical improvement at 28 days occurred in 21 patients (91.3%) in the intervention group vs 15 patients (68.2%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.07-4.32]; P = .03). Among the subgroup of patients with lifethreatening disease (29 in the convalescent plasma group and 29 in the control group), there were no significant differences in the primary outcome or rates of clinical improvement at 28 days: 6 patients (20.7%) in the convalescent plasma group vs 7 patients (24.1%) in the control group (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.30-2.63]; P = .83) (P for interaction = .17). In the entire study population, the findings for several of the secondary end points appeared to signal a more favorable outcome for patients who received convalescent plasma, although there were no statistically significant differences between the convalescent plasma group vs the control group in any of the major secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality (15.7% vs 24.0%, respectively; P = .30) or rate of discharge at 28 days (51% vs 36%; P = .13). Convalescent plasma use in the study by Li et al8 was associated with some clinical improvement in severely ill patients, but not in critically ill patients. Greater efficacy in less ill individuals is expected because antibody therapies generally work best when administered earlier in disease.9 Historically, antibody therapy was effective in reducing the mortality of pneumococcal pneumonia when instituted in the first 3 days of symptom onset.10 Consequently, it is not surprising that patients with COVID-19 who had tachypnea and hypoxia might benefit more from convalescent plasma than those who required mechanical ventilation. However, any indication of possible benefit in the severely ill group is noteworthy because these individuals had advanced disease, which is not considered optimal for antibody therapy. Lack of efficacy among patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation, some with multiorgan failure, highlights that the pathologic process in these individuals is likely irreversible. The convalescent plasma used in the study by Li et al had high titers of IgG to SARS-CoV-2, which correlated with neutralizing activity.

Small-Molecule Oxocarbazate Inhibitor of Human Cathepsin L Blocks Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Ebola Pseudotype Virus Infection into Human Embryonic Kidney 293T cells","abstract":"A tetrahydroquinoline oxocarbazate (PubChem CID 23631927) was tested as an inhibitor of human cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) and as an entry blocker of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Ebola pseudotype virus. In the cathepsin L inhibition assay, the oxocarbazate caused a time-dependent 17-fold drop in IC50 from 6.9 nM (no preincubation) to 0.4 nM (4-h preincubation). Slowly reversible inhibition was demonstrated in a dilution assay. A transient kinetic analysis using a single-step competitive inhibition model provided rate constants of kon = 153,000 M−1s−1 and koff = 4.40 × 10−5 s−1 (Ki = 0.29 nM). The compound also displayed cathepsin L/B selectivity of >700-fold and was nontoxic to human aortic endothelial cells at 100 μM. The oxocarbazate and a related thiocarbazate (PubChem CID 16725315) were tested in a SARS coronavirus (CoV) and Ebola virus-pseudotype infection assay with the oxocarbazate but not the thiocarbazate, demonstrating activity in blocking both SARS-CoV (IC50 = 273 ± 49 nM) and Ebola virus (IC50 = 193 ± 39 nM) entry into human embryonic kidney 293T cells.

A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells).

A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231’s early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations.

The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus.

The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be ∼2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4.

We screened a collection of ∼6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro.

We propose that an imbalance in the action of ACE1‐ and ACE2‐derived peptides, thereby enhancing angiotensin II (Ang II) signalling is primary driver of COVID‐19 pathobiology. ACE1/ACE2 imbalance occurs due to the binding of SARS‐CoV‐2 to ACE2, reducing ACE2‐mediated conversion of Ang II to Ang peptides that counteract pathophysiological effects of ACE1‐generated ANG II. This hypothesis suggests several approaches to treat COVID‐19 by restoring ACE1/ACE2 balance: (a) AT receptor antagonists; (b) ACE1 inhibitors (ACEIs); (iii) agonists of receptors activated by ACE2‐derived peptides (e.g. Ang (1–7), which activates MAS1); (d) recombinant human ACE2 or ACE2 peptides as decoys for the virus.

Bradykinin is a potent part of the vasopressor system that induces hypotension and vasodilation and is degraded by ACE and enhanced by the angiotensin1-9 produced by ACE2. Here, we perform a new analysis on gene expression data from cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients that were used to sequence the virus. Comparison with BALF from controls identifies a critical imbalance in RAS represented by decreased expression of ACE in combination with increases in ACE2, renin, angiotensin, key RAS receptors, kinogen and many kallikrein enzymes that activate it, and both bradykinin receptors. This very atypical pattern of the RAS is predicted to elevate bradykinin levels in multiple tissues and systems that will likely cause increases in vascular dilation, vascular permeability and hypotension.

In this study, we have selected 40 antiviral phytochemicals to find out the best candidates which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. Molecular docking is performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinities and interactions between the phytochemicals and the main protease. The selected candidates strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. To validate the docking interactions, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the five top-ranked inhibitors including hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and α-ketoamide-11r are performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the MD simulation discloses that baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and α-ketoamide-11r have structural similarity with the apo-form of the main protease. These findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) investigations.

Upon virus infection, interferons (IFNs) generate the initial signals for cellular defenses. Knowing that defects in IFN signaling are associated with more severe COVID-19, Wickenhagen et al. used IFN-stimulated gene expression screening on human lung cells from which they identified a gene for 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) (see the Perspective by Schoggins). OAS1 stimulates RNase L to inhibit the virus with a surprising degree of specificity, targeting the membranous organelles in which it replicates. In most mammals, OAS1 is attached to membranes by a prenyl group. However, billions of humans do not have the prenylated OAS1 haplotype, including many experiencing severe COVID-19. The same is true for horseshoe bats, prolific sources of betacoronaviruses, because of an ancient retrotransposition event. —CA A component of the human interferon system that activates SARS-CoV-2 cellular defenses appears to be defective in a large proportion of humans. INTRODUCTION Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that are rapidly deployed in response to invading pathogens. By initiating a signaling cascade that stimulates the expression of hundreds of genes, IFNs create an antiviral state in host cells. Because IFNs heavily influence COVID-19 outcomes, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication can be inhibited by the antiviral state, it is important to understand how the individual antiviral effectors encoded by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) inhibit SARS-CoV-2. RATIONALE We hypothesized that IFN-stimulated antiviral effectors can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, and that variation at the loci encoding these defenses underlies why some people are more susceptible to severe COVID-19. RESULTS We used arrayed ISG expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) consistently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in different contexts. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we found that endogenous OAS1 makes a substantial contribution to the antiviral state by recognizing short stretches of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and activating RNase L. We globally mapped where OAS1 binds to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs and found that OAS1 binding is remarkably specific, with two conserved stem loops in the SARS-CoV-2 5′-untranslated region (UTR) constituting the principal viral target. OAS1 expression was readily detectable at the sites of infection in individuals who died of COVID-19, and specific OAS1 alleles are known to be associated with altered susceptibility to infection and severe disease. It had previously been reported that alleles containing a common splice-acceptor single nucleotide polymorphism in OAS1 (Rs10774671) were associated with less severe COVID-19. We determined that people with at least one allele with a G at this position could express a prenylated form of OAS1 (p46), whereas other individuals could not. Using a series of mutants, we found that C-terminal prenylation was necessary for OAS1 to initiate a block to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, confocal microscopy revealed that prenylation targeted OAS1 to perinuclear structures rich in viral dsRNA, whereas non-prenylated OAS1 was diffusely localized and unable to initiate a detectable block to SARS-CoV-2 replication. The realization that prenylation is essential for OAS1-mediated sensing of SARS-CoV-2 allowed us to examine the transcriptome of infected patients and investigate whether there was a link between the expression of prenylated OAS1 and SARS-CoV-2 disease progression. Analysis of the OAS1 transcripts from 499 hospitalized COVID-19 patients revealed that expressing prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19. Because prenylated OAS1 was so important in human cases, we wanted to determine whether horseshoe bats, the likely source of SARS-CoV-2, possessed the same defense. When we examined the genomic region where the prenylation signal should reside, retrotransposition of a long terminal repeat sequence had ablated this signal, preventing the expression of prenylated anti-CoV OAS1 in these bats. CONCLUSION C-terminal prenylation targets OAS1 to intracellular sites rich in viral dsRNA, which are likely the SARS-CoV-2 replicative organelles. Once in the right place, OAS1 binds to dsRNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 5′-UTR and initiates a potent block to SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, the correct targeting of OAS1 and the subsequent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 likely underpins the genetic association of alleles containing a G at Rs10774671 with reduced susceptibility to infection and severe disease in COVID-19. Moreover, the conspicuous absence of this antiviral defense in horseshoe bats potentially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is so sensitive to this defense in humans. Location, location, location, and dsRNA sensing. A common genetic polymorphism determines whether people make a membrane-associated form of OAS1, a dsRNA sensor. Prenylation targets OAS1 to sites rich in viral dsRNA. Once in the correct place, OAS1 senses dsRNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 5′-UTR and initiates a potent block to SARS-CoV-2 replication. OAS1 based on PDB ID 4IG8. Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is hypothesized that IFN-stimulated antiviral effectors can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, and that variation at the loci encoding these defenses underlies why some people are more susceptible to severe COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1192,"details":{"paperId":"0923974dfd65878c7d9dbc8fb715b18abfa2007c","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7834743","MAG":"3034033967","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112527","CorpusId":"219968711","PubMed":"32563812"},"title":"A promising antiviral candidate drug for the COVID-19 pandemic: A mini-review of remdesivir","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review presents comprehensive information on remdesivir, including information regarding the milestones, intellectual properties, anti-coronavirus mechanisms, preclinical research and clinical trials, and in particular, the chemical synthesis, pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of remdesvir."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3546,"details":{"paperId":"599c7e2375f60c95b9b1d3db1296d04e46cfdd67","externalIds":{"MAG":"2053189438","DOI":"10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181e7c5c9","CorpusId":"5432500","PubMed":"20562702"},"title":"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of TAK-242 for the treatment of severe sepsis*","abstract":"Objective:To evaluate whether TAK-242, a small-molecule inhibitor of Toll-like receptor-4–mediated signaling, suppresses cytokine levels and improves 28-day all-cause mortality rates in patients with severe sepsis.

Interventions:Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 30-min loading dose followed by 96-hr infusions of placebo, TAK-242 1.2 mg/kg/day, or TAK-242 2.4 mg/kg/day. Measurements and Main Results:The primary pharmacodynamic end point was change in serum interleukin-6 levels relative to baseline, with 28-day all-cause mortality rate the primary clinical end point. The trial was terminated because of a lack of effect of TAK-242 in suppressing serum interleukin-6 levels. A total of 274 subjects were randomly assigned and treated. Clinical parameters at baseline were balanced across the three groups. TAK-242 did not suppress interleukin-6 as measured by 0- to 96.5-hr area under the interleukin-6 concentration curve at either dose.

ACE2 bound to tissue facilitates infectivity of SARS-CoV-2; thus, one could argue that decreasing ACE2 tissue expression would be beneficial. However, ACE2 catalytic activity towards angiotensin I (Ang I) and II (Ang II) mitigates deleterious effects associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on several organs, including a pro-inflammatory status. At the tissue level, SARS-CoV-2 (a) binds to ACE2, leading to its internalization, and (b) favors ACE2 cleavage to form soluble ACE2: these actions result in decreased ACE2 tissue levels. Preserving tissue ACE2 activity while preventing ACE2 shredding is expected to circumvent unrestrained inflammatory response. Concerns have been raised around RAAS modulators and their effects on ACE2 expression or catalytic activity. Various cellular and animal models report conflicting results in various tissues. However, recent data from observational and meta-analysis studies in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have concluded that RAAS modulators do not increase plasma ACE2 levels or susceptibility to infection and are not associated with more severe diseases. This review presents our current but evolving knowledge of the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE2 levels, modulators of RAAS activity and the effects of RAAS modulators on ACE2 expression.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Current but evolving knowledge of the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE2 levels, modulators of RAAS activity and the effects of RAas modulators on ACE2 expression are presented."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3504,"details":{"paperId":"3bc0f3d08974693ab8f7db2892f7fc59b0b57764","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7184459","MAG":"3016250474","DOI":"10.1093/ndt/gfaa093","CorpusId":"215774212","PubMed":"32291449"},"title":"ADAM17 inhibition may exert a protective effect on COVID-19","abstract":"During the last 2 months, a novel conoronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been identified, producing a global threat leading to more than 40 598 deaths worldwide [1]. Recently, by genome sequencing and homology modelling, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been found to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, despite amino acid variation at some key residues [2]. The extracellular domain of ACE2 was demonstrated as a receptor for the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV [3]. ACE2 is predominantly expressed on the apical surface of well-differentiated airway epithelia, especially ciliated cells [4, 5]. Since a virus must attach to and enter cells before it can replicate, surface expression of ACE2 and the state of cell differentiation may directly influence SARS-CoV disease pathogenesis [4]. ADAM17 is a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17 that was initially described in 1997 by Black et al. to specifically cleave the precursor of tumour necrosis factor a (pro-TNF-a) [6]. It is already known that ADAM17 can also release the ectodomains of a diverse variety of membraneanchored cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, receptors, ligands and enzymes, such as ACE2 [7]. ACE2 shedding by ADAM17 was first described by Lambert et al. by experiments performed using human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) expressing human ACE2 (HEK-ACE2) in 2005 [7]. Under phorbol myristate acetate stimulation, the ACE2 protein detected on western blot analysis changed from a polypeptide of 120 kDa to a polypeptide of 105 kDa showing a proteolytic shedding occurring in the extracellular juxtamembrane region and releasing an enzymatic active ectodomain [7]. The authors developed distinct techniques to detect the main proteinase responsible for this proteolytic shedding event. First, incubation of HEK-ACE2 cells with TNF-a protease inhibitor 1 (TAPI-1), a hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitor, helped to detect ADAM17 as the main enzyme responsible for ACE2 shedding. Secondly, the use of natural inhibitors of metalloproteinases such as TIMP-3 also showed a reduced stimulated ADAM17 shedding activity. Finally, the confirmation was made using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce the expression of ADAM17. Analysis of media proteins collected following incubation of transfected cells demonstrated an associated decrease in stimulated ACE2 shedding. These studies suggested that the up-regulation of ACE2 shedding could modulate high levels of shed ACE2, which could inhibit the infectivity of the SARS virus [7]. In the same line, Jia et al. [4] demonstrated that ACE2 sheds from differentiated primary airway epithelial cells and Calu-3 cell line. When SARS S protein pseudovirions were applied to HEK cells transfected with wildtype ACE2, SARS-CoV S was efficiently transduced. In contrast, when ACE2-SEC (containing the entire ACE2 ectodomain fused to the secretion signal peptide of the human b-defensin 2 gene) and ACE2-DRBD (containing alanine substitution mutations that allow the interaction with SARS-S) were cotransfected into HEK293 cells, the transduction efficiency of S protein-pseudotyped virions failed to increase, demonstrating that ACE2 must be cell-associated to serve as a coronavirus receptor, and that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) competes for S protein binding [8]. However, there are some controversies regarding the role of ADAM17 and sACE2 during virus infection. In that sense, in 2008, Haga et al. found that SARS-S induced ADAM17dependent shedding of ACE2 and also that the process was coupled with TNF-a production. They demonstrated that mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 inhibited its shedding and reduced viral infection, and ACE2 or ADAM17 silencing blocked viral infection. Interestingly, mutants of cytoplasmic ACE2 were unable to activate either ACE2 shedding or TNF-a production, or even SARS-S binding. From these findings, they suggested that ADAM17 activity is modulated by the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2, facilitating both virus entry and tissue damage through TNF-a. However, the authors do not specify the intracellular pathway activated by the intracellular domain of ACE2 [9]. The authors postulated that ACE2 is down-regulated after viral infection because ACE2 shedding increases. However, administration of TAPI-0 and ADAM17 siRNA inhibited ACE2 shedding, while introduction of ADAM17 cDNA recovered SARS-S-induced shedding. Finally, this study also showed that ADAM17 siRNA reduced SARS-CoV infection, indicating that ADAM17 plays an important role in the entry of SARSCoV. It is unclear how ADAM17 facilitates viral entry. However, it seems that the peptidase activity would be critical","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The authors developed distinct techniques to detect the main proteinase responsible for this proteolytic shedding event and confirmed that ACE2 must be cell-associated to serve as a coronavirus receptor, and that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) competes for S protein binding."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":204,"details":{"paperId":"eec0460c5ba6dcfe91a295c3b8622a8185028647","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9015574","DOI":"10.1002/JLB.3COVA0421-195RR","CorpusId":"244696274","PubMed":"34826347"},"title":"ADAM17/MMP inhibition prevents neutrophilia and lung injury in a mouse model of COVID‐19","abstract":"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is characterized by lung injury, cytokine storm, and increased neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Current therapies focus on reducing viral replication and inflammatory responses, but no specific treatment exists to prevent the development of severe COVID‐19 in infected individuals. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, the virus causing COVID‐19, but it is also critical for maintaining the correct functionality of lung epithelium and endothelium. Coronaviruses induce activation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) and shedding of ACE2 from the cell surface resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses. Thus, we hypothesized that ADAM17 inhibition ameliorates COVID‐19‐related lung inflammation. We employed a preclinical mouse model using intratracheal instillation of a combination of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and the receptor‐binding domain of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein (RBD‐S) to mimic lung damage associated with COVID‐19. Histologic analysis of inflamed mice confirmed the expected signs of lung injury including edema, fibrosis, vascular congestion, and leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, inflamed mice also showed an increased NLR as observed in critically ill COVID‐19 patients. Administration of the ADAM17/MMP inhibitors apratastat and TMI‐1 significantly improved lung histology and prevented leukocyte infiltration. Reduced leukocyte recruitment could be explained by reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines and lower levels of the endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM‐1 and VCAM‐1. Additionally, the NLR was significantly reduced by ADAM17/MMP inhibition.

Although remdesivir has recently been approved by the FDA to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, no oral antiviral is available for outpatient treatment. AT-527, an orally administered double prodrug of a guanosine nucleotide analog, was previously shown to be highly efficacious and well tolerated in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects. Here, we report the potent in vitro activity of AT-511, the free base of AT-527, against several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In normal human airway epithelial cells, the concentration of AT-511 required to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 by 90% (EC90) was 0.47 μM, very similar to its EC90 against human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV in Huh-7 cells. Little to no cytotoxicity was observed for AT-511 at concentrations up to 100 μM. Substantial levels of the active triphosphate metabolite AT-9010 were formed in normal human bronchial and nasal epithelial cells incubated with 10 μM AT-511 (698 ± 15 and 236 ± 14 μM, respectively), with a half-life of at least 38 h. Results from steady-state pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies of nonhuman primates administered oral doses of AT-527, as well as pharmacokinetic data from subjects given daily oral doses of AT-527, predict that twice daily oral doses of 550 mg AT-527 will produce AT-9010 trough concentrations in human lung that exceed the EC90 observed for the prodrug against SARS-CoV-2 replication.

On multivariate analysis, hemoglobin level was an independent prognostic correlate of hypoxemia or mortality (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.8; p = 0.03).

We and others have demonstrated its role in reducing acute lung injury by inhibiting inflammation, cell death, coagulation, and neutrophil elastase activation. Recently, A1AT has been found to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by inhibiting transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. This dual role of both antiviral infection and anti-inflammation makes A1AT a unique and excellent candidate for COVID-19 treatment.

With the help of bioinformatics, we have predicted several novel exons of the human ACE2 gene. The inclusion of novel exons located in the 5'UTR/intronic region in the mature transcript may remove the critical ACE2 residues responsible for the interaction with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, thus preventing their binding and entry into the cell. Additionally, inclusion of a novel predicted exons located in the 3'UTR by alternative splicing may remove the C-terminal transmembrane domain of ACE2 and generate soluble ACE2 isoforms. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) have been employed effectively as a therapeutic strategy in several disease conditions. Alternative splicing of the ACE2 gene could similarly be modulated using SSOs to exclude critical domains required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, using Vero cells, we tested the impact of amiodarone on the in vitro spreading of the SARS coronavirus. We found that (1) amiodarone associates with different cell membranes and accumulates in acidic organelles; (2) the diethylamino-beta-ethoxy group is an important determinant of uptake; (3) vacuoles forming upon exposure to amiodarone are enlarged late endosomes; (4) amiodarone inhibits the spreading in vitro of SARS coronavirus; and (5) trypsin cleavage of the viral spike protein before infection, which permits virus entry through the plasma membrane, does not impair amiodarone antiviral activity.

Since then, the SARS-Cov2 infection has become pandemic and the correlated coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been showing a plethora of pathophysiological manifestations that do not exclusively reduce COVID-19 to the occurrence of severe acute respiratory distress (Cevik et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Harapan et al., 2020; Ryu and Chun, 2020; Sen et al., 2020). Although the immunological responses against SARS-Cov2 remain poorly defined (Chen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020), it is of note that the critical phase of COVID-19 currently appears, at least in some critical pathophysiological aspects, as a sort of autoimmune disease or as immune response hypersensitivity. Consequently, many authors have proposed various therapeutic approaches based on the modulation/inhibition of abnormal immune response in COVID-19 (Askanase et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020; Piva et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Radbel et al., 2020; Whyte et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020; Zhao, 2020). Recently, the effects of Tocilizumab administration has seemed to indicate that inhibition of the Interleukin (IL)-6 receptor (IL-6R) may result in the recovery of critical COVID-19 patients (Aziz et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) in the advanced post-alveolitic phase, when extensive pulmonary fibrosis is accompanied by a diffuse interstitial inflammation apparently sustained by a described exacerbated cytokine storm (Askanase et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020; Piva et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Radbel et al., 2020; Whyte et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020; Zhao, 2020). Such evidence highlights the critical relevance of controlling the IL-6/IL-6R pro-inflammatory pathway in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in order to mitigate the adverse immune response that is a determinant of the most serious and undesirable phase of SARS-Cov2 infection (Whyte et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020; Zhao, 2020). In particular, hyper-reactivity was described as a major feature of the critical phase of COVID-19, broadly due to the hyperacute inflammatory context that leads to pulmonary interstitial disease and severe acute respiratory distress (Askanase et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020; Piva et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Radbel et al., 2020; Whyte et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020; Zhao, 2020).","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Evidence highlights the critical relevance of controlling the IL-6/IL-6R pro-inflammatory pathway in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in order to mitigate the adverse immune response that is a determinant of the most serious and undesirable phase of SARS-Cov2 infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3869,"details":{"paperId":"5bc856b643a47aaa3746611fcc4d00258797d6c7","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7276055","MAG":"3033559278","DOI":"10.1101/2020.06.04.135046","CorpusId":"219545909","PubMed":"32511420"},"title":"An OpenData portal to share COVID-19 drug repurposing data in real time","abstract":"The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has developed an online open science data portal for its COVID-19 drug repurposing campaign – named OpenData – with the goal of making data across a range of SARS-CoV-2 related assays available in real-time.

A replicating RNA vaccine candidate to fight COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is having a major global public health impact necessitating the rapid development of an effective vaccine. Erasmus et al. report that a replicating RNA vaccine stabilized in a lipid inorganic nanoparticle (LION) formulation induced robust antibody responses after a single intramuscular immunization in mice and after a single intramuscular injection at five different sites in macaques. These antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at titers comparable to those reported in humans convalescing from COVID-19. Prime/boost vaccination of mice and macaques also induced T cell responses that could potentially contribute to protection. This RNA vaccine also induced robust immune responses in aged mice, suggesting the potential for protection in the elderly. These findings support further development of this COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is having a deleterious impact on health services and the global economy, highlighting the urgent need for an effective vaccine. Such a vaccine would need to rapidly confer protection after one or two doses and would need to be manufactured using components suitable for scale up. Here, we developed an Alphavirus-derived replicon RNA vaccine candidate, repRNA-CoV2S, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The RNA replicons were formulated with lipid inorganic nanoparticles (LIONs) that were designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery, and immunogenicity. We show that a single intramuscular injection of the LION/repRNA-CoV2S vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti–SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a type 1 T helper cell response. A prime/boost regimen induced potent T cell responses in mice including antigen-specific responses in the lung and spleen. Prime-only immunization of aged (17 months old) mice induced smaller immune responses compared to young mice, but this difference was abrogated by booster immunization. In nonhuman primates, prime-only immunization in one intramuscular injection site or prime/boost immunizations in five intramuscular injection sites elicited modest T cell responses and robust antibody responses. The antibody responses persisted for at least 70 days and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at titers comparable to those in human serum samples collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19. These data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that a single intramuscular injection of the LION/repRNA-CoV2S vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti–SARS- coV-2 S protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a type 1 T helper cell response, and these data support further development of LIONS/rep RNA-Cov2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection against SARS-Co V-2 infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3790,"details":{"paperId":"403437747134945e757a850a358634e98f44b154","externalIds":{"MAG":"3023906977","DOI":"10.1101/2020.05.02.074021","CorpusId":"218539216"},"title":"An artificial intelligence system reveals liquiritin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by mimicking type I interferon","abstract":"The pandemic COVID-19 has spread to all over the world and greatly threatens safety and health of people.

Owen et al. report the discovery and characterization of a drug against the main protease involved in the cleavage of polyproteins involved in viral replication. The drug, PF-07321332, can be administered orally, has good selectivity and safety profiles, and protects against infection in a mouse model. In a phase 1 clinical trial, the drug reached concentrations expected to inhibit the virus based on in vitro studies. It also inhibited other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and could be in the armory against future viral threats. —VV PF-07321332 is an orally active, small-molecule inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease that is in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic. Alongside vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are an important part of the healthcare response to countering the ongoing threat presented by COVID-19. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of PF-07321332, an orally bioavailable SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor with in vitro pan-human coronavirus antiviral activity and excellent off-target selectivity and in vivo safety profiles. PF-07321332 has demonstrated oral activity in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model and has achieved oral plasma concentrations exceeding the in vitro antiviral cell potency in a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy human participants.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The discovery and characterization of a drug against the main protease involved in the cleavage of polyproteins involved in viral replication is reported, which can be administered orally, has good selectivity and safety profiles, and protects against infection in a mouse model."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4603,"details":{"paperId":"40f449e89859948ab1d675c0b331144f0cc56ddf","externalIds":{"MAG":"3014708904","PubMedCentral":"7164393","DOI":"10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883","CorpusId":"215409105","PubMed":"32253226"},"title":"An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and multiple coronaviruses in mice","abstract":"A ribonucleoside analog inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in mice. Catastrophic consequences Broad-spectrum antivirals are desirable, particularly in the context of emerging zoonotic infections for which specific interventions do not yet exist. Sheahan et al. tested the potential of a ribonucleoside analog previously shown to be active against other RNA viruses such as influenza and Ebola virus to combat coronaviruses. This drug was effective in cell lines and primary human airway epithelial cultures against multiple coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Mouse models of SARS and MERS demonstrated that early treatment reduced viral replication and damage to the lungs. Mechanistically, this drug is incorporated into the viral RNA, inducing mutations and eventually leading to error catastrophe in the virus. In this manner, inducing catastrophe could help avoid catastrophe by stemming the next pandemic. Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Here, we show that the ribonucleoside analog β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-1931) has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a CoV bearing resistance mutations to the nucleoside analog inhibitor remdesivir.

Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral, but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis in CoV.

A novel six-category ordinal endpoint of patient status is being used in a randomized controlled trial (FLU-Intravenous Immunoglobulin - FLU-IVIG) of intravenous immunoglobulin. We systematically examine four factors regarding the use of this ordinal endpoint that may affect power from fitting a proportional odds model: (1) deviations from the proportional odds assumption which result in the same overall treatment effect as specified in the FLU-IVIG protocol and which result in a diminished overall treatment effect, (2) deviations from the distribution of the placebo group assumed in the FLU-IVIG design, (3) the effect of patient misclassification among the six categories, and (4) the number of categories of the ordinal endpoint. We also consider interactions between the treatment effect (i.e. factor 1) and each other factor. Methods We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to assess the effect of each factor. To study factor 1, we developed an algorithm for deriving distributions of the ordinal endpoint in the two treatment groups that deviated from proportional odds while maintaining the same overall treatment effect. For factor 2, we considered placebo group distributions which were more or less skewed than the one specified in the FLU-IVIG protocol by adding or subtracting a constant from the cumulative log odds. To assess factor 3, we added misclassification between adjacent pairs of categories that depend on subjective patient/clinician assessments. For factor 4, we collapsed some categories into single categories. Results Deviations from proportional odds reduced power at most from 80% to 77% given the same overall treatment effect as specified in the FLU-IVIG protocol. Misclassification and collapsing categories can reduce power by over 40 and 10 percentage points, respectively, when they affect categories with many patients and a discernible treatment effect. But collapsing categories that contain no treatment effect can raise power by over 20 percentage points. Differences in the distribution of the placebo group can raise power by over 20 percentage points or reduce power by over 40 percentage points depending on how patients are shifted to portions of the ordinal endpoint with a large treatment effect. Conclusion Provided that the overall treatment effect is maintained, deviations from proportional odds marginally reduce power. However, deviations from proportional odds can modify the effect of misclassification, the number of categories, and the distribution of the placebo group on power. In general, adjacent pairs of categories with many patients should be kept separate to help ensure that power is maintained at the pre-specified level.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Deviations from proportional odds reduced power at most from 80% to 77% given the same overall treatment effect as specified in the FLU-IVIG protocol."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2903,"details":{"paperId":"b510c790a45af62ebb73206182a80667afbd60ac","externalIds":{"MAG":"3086603362","PubMedCentral":"7490396","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-71748-7","CorpusId":"221720880","PubMed":"32929138"},"title":"Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein glycan shield reveals implications for immune recognition","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the notable exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":695,"details":{"paperId":"8cf9fa3a18e89f24ed670ce8a914504822b9aa0b","externalIds":{"MAG":"3008142620","PubMedCentral":"7102550","DOI":"10.1016/j.apsb.2020.02.008","CorpusId":"214495563","PubMed":"32292689"},"title":"Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling and constructed a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3150,"details":{"paperId":"53e7a4335ce55f1f7d1a802195ca21cb5796cb74","externalIds":{"MAG":"3020749996","PubMedCentral":"7212536","DOI":"10.1080/07391102.2020.1760136","CorpusId":"216110527","PubMed":"32329419"},"title":"Andrographolide as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease: an in silico approach","abstract":"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 virus which caused the global pandemic the Coronavirus Disease- 2019 (COVID-2019) has infected about 1,203,959 patients and brought forth death rate about 64,788 among 206 countries as mentioned by WHO in the month of April 2020.

Moreover, vaccines based on viral‐encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of being on an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) and/or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) on hospital admission, on the following COVID-19 outcomes: disease severity, ICU admission, and mortality. Methods: The charts of all patients consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 from the 24th of February to the 16th of June of the year 2020 in Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah hospital in Kuwait were checked. All related patient information and clinical data was retrieved from the hospitals electronic medical record system. The primary outcome was COVID-19 disease severity defined as the need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Secondary outcome was mortality. Results: A total of 4,019 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 325 patients (8.1%) used ACEI/ARB, users of ACEI/ARB were found to be significantly older (54.4 vs. 40.5 years). ACEI/ARB users were found to have more co-morbidities; diabetes (45.8 vs. 14.8%) and hypertension (92.9 vs. 13.0%). ACEI/ARB use was found to be significantly associated with greater risk of ICU admission in the unadjusted analysis [OR, 1.51 (95% CI: 1.04–2.19), p = 0.028].

Here, Greaney et al. demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies elicited by immunization with the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine were more focused to the RBD than those elicited by natural infection.

The susceptibility of immunity to viral evolution is shaped in part by the breadth of epitopes targeted by antibodies elicited by vaccination or natural infection. To investigate how human antibody responses to vaccines are influenced by viral mutations, we used deep mutational scanning to compare the specificity of polyclonal antibodies elicited by either two doses of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine or natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies was more targeted to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared to antibodies elicited by natural infection. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies was more broadly distributed across epitopes compared to infection-elicited antibodies.

Experimental Approach Several antidepressant drugs and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses.

However, its antigenic and immunogenic properties remain to be elucidated. In this study, we immunized mice with full-length S protein (FL-S) or its extracellular domain (EC-S) expressed by recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells. We found that the immunized mice developed high titers of anti-S antibodies with potent neutralizing activities against SARS pseudoviruses constructed with the S proteins of Tor2, GD03T13, and SZ3, the representative strains of 2002 to 2003 and 2003 to 2004 human SARS-CoV and palm civet SARS-CoV, respectively. These data suggest that the recombinant baculovirus-expressed S protein vaccines possess excellent immunogenicity, thereby inducing highly potent neutralizing responses against human and animal SARS-CoV variants. The antigenic structure of the S protein was characterized by a panel of 38 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) isolated from the immunized mice. The epitopes of most anti-S MAbs (32 of 38) were localized within the S1 domain, and those of the remaining 6 MAbs were mapped to the S2 domain. Among the anti-S1 MAbs, 17 MAbs targeted the N-terminal region (amino acids [aa] 12 to 327), 9 MAbs recognized the receptor-binding domain (RBD; aa 318 to 510), and 6 MAbs reacted with the C-terminal region of S1 domain that contains the major immunodominant site (aa 528 to 635). Strikingly, all of the RBD-specific MAbs had potent neutralizing activity, 6 of which efficiently blocked the receptor binding, confirming that the RBD contains the main neutralizing epitopes and that blockage of the receptor association is the major mechanism of SARS-CoV neutralization. Five MAbs specific for the S1 N-terminal region exhibited moderate neutralizing activity, but none of the MAbs reacting with the S2 domain and the major immunodominant site in S1 showed neutralizing activity.

Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.

Ivermectin (IVM), a macrocytic lactone with a wide anti-parasitary spectrum, has shown potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures.  \n \nMethods: We completed a pilot, randomized, controlled, outcome-assessor blinded clinical trial with the goal of evaluating the antiviral activity of high dose IVM in COVID-19 patients. Eligible patients were adults (aged 18 to 69 years) with mild or moderate RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days of symptoms onset. 45 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to standard of care plus oral IVM at 0·6 mg/kg/day for 5 days versus standard of care. The primary endpoint was viral load reduction in respiratory secretions at day-5. Viral load in respiratory secretions was measured through quantitative RT-PCR. Concentrations of IVM in plasma were measured on multiple treatment days. \n \nFindings: The trial run between May 18 and September 29, 2020 with 45 randomized patients (30 in the IVM group and 15 controls). There was no difference in viral load reduction between groups but a significant difference in reduction was found in patients with higher median plasma IVM levels (72% IQR 59 – 77) versus untreated controls (42% IQR 31 – 73) (p=0·004). The mean ivermectin plasma concentration levels also showed a positive correlation with viral decay rate (r:0·47, p=0·02). Adverse events were reported in 5 (33%) patients in the controls and 13 (43%) in the IVM treated group, without a relationship between IVM plasma levels and adverse events. \n \nInterpretation: A concentration dependent antiviral activity of oral high dose IVM was identified in this pilot trial at a dosing regimen that was well tolerated. Large trials with clinical endpoints are necessary to determine the clinical utility of IVM in COVID-19. \n \nTrial Registration: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT004381884. \n \nFunding Statement: This work was supported by grant IP-COVID-19-625 from Agencia Nacional de Promocion de la Investigacion, el Desarrollo Tecnologico y la Innovacion, Argentina and Laboratorio ELEA/Phoenix, Argentina. \n \nDeclaration of Interests: AK reports grants from Laboratorio Elea/Phoenix.

It is an inexpensive, efficacious, and safe drug frequently prescribed around the world. Following anecdotal evidence from 17 patients in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, Canada, suggesting that malarone/atovaquone may present some benefits in protecting against COVID-19, we sought to examine its antiviral potential in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cellular models of infection. In VeroE6 expressing human TMPRSS2 and human lung Calu-3 epithelial cells, we show that the active compound atovaquone at micromolar concentrations potently inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of concern including the alpha, beta, and delta variants. Importantly, atovaquone retained its full antiviral activity in a primary human airway epithelium cell culture model. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the atovaquone antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 is partially dependent on the expression of TMPRSS2 and that the drug can disrupt the interaction of the spike protein with the viral receptor, ACE2. Additionally, spike-mediated membrane fusion was also reduced in the presence of atovaquone. In the United States, two clinical trials of atovaquone administered alone or in combination with azithromycin were initiated in 2020.

Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga®, (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial.

However, there is some evidence of discrete COVID-19 symptoms and a rapid recovery in patients receiving guselkumab (anti-interluekin [IL]-23) and ixekizumab (anti-IL-17). Moreover, Conti et al reported how elderly psoriatic patients receiving secukinumab (anti-IL-17) and adalimumab (antitumor necrosis factor alpha [anti-TNFα]) were completely unreceptive to COVID-19. As cytokine-mediated immune response plays an important role in the development of infection, the use of ixekizumab and adalimumab associated to antiviral drugs are currently being studied in the treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mugheddu et al reported on apremilast in psoriatic patient contracting severe COVID-19 infection. He was a high-risk patient with the possibility of a very bad prognosis because of obesity along with recent chemotherapy for a persisting brain tumor. However, the COVID-19 was clinically cured within a week of admission to an intensive care unit without stopping the apremilast therapy. The authors concluded that the safety of apremilast in COVID-19 was confirmed, without interfering with the infection. However, no information is available about how long he had been using apremilast when he was infected with COVID-19. We would like to report a case of a 61-year-old male suffering from moderate psoriasis for almost 15 years. Since September 2019 he has been treated with apremilast in a recommended dosing regimen (30 mg orally twice a day), which has led to complete remission. He was previously treated by psoralen-UVA (PUVA) phototherapy and conventional systemic treatment including methotrexate. In midApril his wife and children, who live all together with the patient, were diagnosed as being SARS-CoV-2-positive and developed symptoms of infection including severe cough with fever (38.5 C-39.1 C), bilateral interstitial pneumonia, myalgia, anosmia and fatigue. Despite the prolonged close contact with his family members during self-isolation, with all the inherent risks of contracting the disease, and the added vulnerability due to age, the patient had no symptoms of infection. However, due to the contact with COVID-19 positive subjects the patient was quarantined for 14 days and tested for coronavirus using nasopharyngeal swab, which was positive. Computed tomography findings revealed no pulmonary changes. Such an infection route may be regarded as a result of taking apremilast for 8 months by the time of contact with COVID-19, and we suppose that the drug has already been accumulated in the body, resulting in its defense against COVID-19. This is due to its mechanism of action, which has the following sequence: phosphodiesterase inhibition, increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, and a decreased expression of TNF-α, which is reported to be markedly increased during COVID-19. COVID-19 pandemic has spread all around the world with, to date, 4 586 915 confirmed cases and 309 184 deaths. However, currently no specific treatments exist. We suggest that ongoing treatment with phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor apremilast might play a protective role against the evolution of the infection. Nevertheless, further investigations are needed to confirm our hypothesis.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that ongoing treatment with phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor apremilast might play a protective role against the evolution of the infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6049,"details":{"paperId":"b1d912456712a363d59b05e033e7e64d34581ac5","externalIds":{"MAG":"3097385142","PubMedCentral":"7692688","DOI":"10.3390/cells9112377","CorpusId":"226249564","PubMed":"33143316"},"title":"Aprotinin Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Replication","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the current coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Herein, we showed that the protease inhibitor aprotinin (but not the protease inhibitor SERPINA1/alpha-1 antitrypsin) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in therapeutically achievable concentrations. An analysis of proteomics and translatome data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is associated with a downregulation of host cell protease inhibitors. Hence, aprotinin may compensate for downregulated host cell proteases during later virus replication cycles. Aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in different cell types (Caco2, Calu-3, and primary bronchial epithelial cell air–liquid interface cultures) and against four virus isolates. In conclusion, therapeutic aprotinin concentrations exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.

The molecular mechanism of virus infection and spread in the body is not yet disclosed, but studies on other betacoronaviruses show that, upon cell infection, these viruses inhibit macroautophagy/autophagy flux and cause the accumulation of autophagosomes. No drug has yet been approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, preclinical investigations suggested repurposing of several FDA-approved drugs for clinical trials. Half of these drugs are modulators of the autophagy pathway. Unexpectedly, instead of acting by directly antagonizing the effects of viruses, these drugs appear to function by suppressing autophagy flux. Based on the established cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis, we speculate that over-accumulation of autophagosomes activates an apoptotic pathway that results in apoptotic death of the infected cells and disrupts the virus replication cycle.

Due to the rapid outbreak of the transmission (~3.64 million positive cases and high mortality as of 5 May 2020), the world is looking for immediate and better therapeutic options. Still, much information is not known, including origin of the disease, complete genomic characterization, mechanism of transmission dynamics, extent of spread, possible genetic predisposition, clinical and biological diagnosis, complete details of disease-induced pathogenicity, and possible therapeutic options. Although several known drugs are already under clinical evaluation with many in repositioning strategies, much attention has been paid to the aminoquinoline derivates, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). These molecules are known regulators of endosomes/lysosomes, which are subcellular organelles central to autophagy processes. By elevating the pH of acidic endosomes/lysosomes, CQ/HCQ inhibit the autophagic process. In this short perspective, we discuss the roles of CQ/HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and propose new ways of possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the molecules that selectivity target autophagy.Abbreviation: ACE2: angiotensin I converting enzyme 2; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; MERS-CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The roles of CQ/HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are discussed and new ways of possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the molecules that selectivity target autophagy are proposed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5993,"details":{"paperId":"723dccc2b45ff2eb5388496e5b2badd80ab445b2","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7264155","MAG":"3030260474","DOI":"10.3389/fphar.2020.00791","CorpusId":"218871499","PubMed":"32574236"},"title":"Available Evidence and Ongoing Clinical Trials of Remdesivir: Could It Be a Promising Therapeutic Option for COVID-19?","abstract":"The novel coronavirus strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and is skyrocketing throughout the globe and become a global public health emergency.

Remdesivir is an investigational drug having broad spectrum antiviral activity with its target RNA dependent RNA polymerase. It has not yet been officially approved for Ebola and Coronaviruses. Several studies showed that remdesivir had promising in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV strains. On the top of this, it exhibited a promising in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 strains though there are no published studies that substantiate its activity in vivo until the time of this review. There are few phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials on the way to investigate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir. Of which, one completed double blind, placebo controlled trial showed that remdesivir showed faster time to clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 patients compared to placebo though not found statistically significant.

Agents that inhibit components of the pro‐inflammatory cascade have garnered interest as potential treatment options with hopes that dampening the proinflammatory process may improve clinical outcomes. Baricitinib is a reversible Janus‐associated kinase (JAK)‐inhibitor that interrupts the signaling of multiple cytokines implicated in COVID‐19 immunopathology. It may also have antiviral effects by targeting host factors that viruses rely for cell entry and by suppressing type I interferon driven angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme‐2 upregulation. However, baricitinib’s immunosuppressive effects may be detrimental during acute viral infections by delaying viral clearance and increasing vulnerability to secondary opportunistic infections. The lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor patients’ immune status as illness evolves complicates deployment of immunosuppressive drugs like baricitinib. Furthermore, baricitinib carries the risk of increased thromboembolic events, which is concerning given the proclivity towards a hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID‐19.

No specific treatment has yet clearly shown to improve the disease's evolution. Validated therapeutic options are urgently needed. Methods. In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate determinants of the prognosis of the disease in 70 patients with COVID-19 severe pneumonia (i.e. requiring at least 3 liters of oxygen) hospitalized between 10 March and 9 April, 2020, in the Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman, France. The main outcome was oro-tracheal intubation and the exposure of interest was corticotherapy. Since this was not a randomized trial, we used propensity score matching to estimate average treatment effect. Results. There was evidence that corticotherapy lowered the risk of intubation with a risk difference of -47.1% (95% confidence interval -71.8% to -22.5%). Conclusion. Corticosteroid, a well-known, easily available, and cheap treatment, could be an important tool in management of severe COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.

There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells.

Serology testing is important for diagnosis of infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting past infection for population-based studies, are priorities. Methods: We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS). Results: The LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of the N antigen in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so.

Wec et al. isolated and characterized hundreds of antibodies against the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 from the memory B cells of a survivor of the 2003 outbreak caused by the related coronavirus, SARS-CoV. In both of these viruses, the spike protein facilitated viral entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells. The antibodies targeted multiple sites on the spike protein, but of nine antibodies that showed strong cross-neutralization, eight targeted the domain that binds to ACE2. These eight antibodies also neutralized a bat SARS-related virus.

Science, this issue p. 731 Broadly neutralizing antibodies that target overlapping epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been isolated. Broadly protective vaccines against known and preemergent human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are urgently needed. To gain a deeper understanding of cross-neutralizing antibody responses, we mined the memory B cell repertoire of a convalescent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) donor and identified 200 SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binding antibodies that target multiple conserved sites on the spike (S) protein. A large proportion of the non-neutralizing antibodies display high levels of somatic hypermutation and cross-react with circulating HCoVs, suggesting recall of preexisting memory B cells elicited by prior HCoV infections. Several antibodies potently cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and the bat SARS-like virus WIV1 by blocking receptor attachment and inducing S1 shedding.

While several studies support that some amino acid changes between animal and human viruses are the result of inter-species adaptation, the role of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in driving SARS-CoV evolution, particularly during intra-species transmission, is unknown. A detailed examination of SARS-CoV infected animal and human convalescent sera could provide evidence of nAb pressure which, if found, may lead to strategies to effectively block virus evolution pathways by broadening the activity of nAbs. Here we show, by focusing on a dominant neutralization epitope, that contemporaneous- and cross-strain nAb responses against SARS-CoV spike protein exist during natural infection. In vitro immune pressure on this epitope using 2002/03 strain-specific nAb 80R recapitulated a dominant escape mutation that was present in all 2003/04 animal and human viruses. Strategies to block this nAb escape/naturally occurring evolution pathway by generating broad nAbs (BnAbs) with activity against 80R escape mutants and both 2002/03 and 2003/04 strains were explored. Structure-based amino acid changes in an activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) “hot spot” in a light chain CDR (complementarity determining region) alone, introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non-immune human VL chain repertoire or by targeted mutagenesis, were successful in generating these BnAbs. These results demonstrate that nAb-mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra-species transmission of SARS-CoV. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of a single VL CDR can markedly broaden the activity of a strain-specific nAb. The strategies investigated in this study, in particular the use of structural information in combination of chain-shuffling as well as hot-spot CDR mutagenesis, can be exploited to broaden neutralization activity, to improve anti-viral nAb therapies, and directly manipulate virus evolution.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that nAb-mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra-species transmission of SARS-CoV, and structural information in combination of chain-shuffling as well as hot-spot CDR mutagenesis can be exploited to broaden neutralization activity and improve anti-viral nAb therapies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2801,"details":{"paperId":"bdf71ec2fb937575cfac69d4a49cbaa1bb32f9b3","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-04386-2","CorpusId":"245206373","PubMed":"34931194"},"title":"Broadly neutralizing antibodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 Omicron antigenic shift","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize RBD epitopes that are conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other sarbecoviruses may prove key to controlling the ongoing pandemic and future zoonotic spillovers."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":495,"details":{"paperId":"846e9e5e90e0faf127a79a3f54d16b6b5a7b9981","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7817248","DOI":"10.1007/s10875-021-00972-1","CorpusId":"231662889","PubMed":"33474624"},"title":"C1 Esterase Inhibition: Targeting Multiple Systems in COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A review of physiologic rationales, basic science and translational data, and preliminary clinical results suggests the involvement of C1 esterase inhibitor-related processes in COVID-19 pathology and specifies opportunities for further investigation."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":541,"details":{"paperId":"66a9fd41eb1bcd6df3349694c3609c9d8c1df476","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s12015-020-09976-7","CorpusId":"255442937"},"title":"CD147 as a Target for COVID-19 Treatment: Suggested Effects of Azithromycin and Stem Cell Engagement","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"CD147, a receptor on host cells, is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion, and drugs that interfere in the spike protein/CD147 interaction or CD147 expression may inhibit viral invasion and dissemination among other cells, including in progenitor/stem cells."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2232,"details":{"paperId":"4e230ef12ff3f00d42310e542428e79db33baef7","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7480990","MAG":"3083863843","DOI":"10.1016/S2665-9913(20)30313-1","CorpusId":"221565575","PubMed":"32929415"},"title":"COVACTA trial raises questions about tocilizumab's benefit in COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2375,"details":{"paperId":"94b3afb673e5867563d2df5e9515d4234178a505","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/d41586-021-00650-7","CorpusId":"232218189","PubMed":"33712752"},"title":"COVID antibody treatments show promise for preventing severe disease","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["News"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"But uptake by patients and physicians in the United States, where some therapies have been authorized for months, has been low, according to a study in JAMA Internal Medicine."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2379,"details":{"paperId":"6d26b08094a3a88a447aea05af03b6c71bcd64df","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/d41586-021-03074-5","CorpusId":"243989001","PubMed":"34759341"},"title":"COVID antiviral pills: what scientists still want to know","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["News"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2372,"details":{"paperId":"f35236d336ccdf6fae655d39144db412ad793a78","externalIds":{"MAG":"3098764007","DOI":"10.1038/d41586-020-03248-7","CorpusId":"226990636","PubMed":"33199901"},"title":"COVID vaccine excitement builds as Moderna reports third positive result","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["News"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5867,"details":{"paperId":"67c48d46af47b6852e07966c63499516d4a843c4","externalIds":{"MAG":"3040508291","PubMedCentral":"7350702","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2020.01581","CorpusId":"220323583","PubMed":"32719684"},"title":"COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine Design Using Reverse Vaccinology and Machine Learning","abstract":"To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be localized on the surface of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets have the potential for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.

Today the world is facing a global pandemic which has never been seen in the era of transplantation and immunotherapy. As of April 7, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been confirmed in .1.25 million people worldwide with a mortality rate of 5.7%. The presence of comorbid conditions is associated with higher risk of death, which is concerning because significant comorbidity is common in recipients of transplants.1 The additional risk posed by immunosuppression in these patients cannot be estimated due to lack of data. Logically, transplant clinicians are needing to extrapolate from evidence obtained from treating other life-threatening infections in recipients of transplants, which involves reducing or stopping immunosuppression. At the time of writing, published data are available in 11 transplant patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (eight adult and three pediatric patients).2–6 Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are the cornerstone of transplant maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, and all patients were receiving CNIs at the time of diagnosis. In keeping with what is known in the general population, all pediatric outcomes were favorable. In the adult cases, seven of the eight case reports describe management that included withdrawal of both CNIs and antiproliferative agents; in these cases, outcomes were variable (three patients survived, three remain in critical care, and two deaths).2–4,6 Several guidelines have since been developed that recommend withdrawal of CNIs in transplant patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.7,8 Two features of CNIs, one experimental and the other clinical, warrant attention because they may have important repercussions not only for patients who have received a transplant but also in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in general. Firstly, it is known that a number of viruses use active immunophilin pathways during their life cycle, and that CNIs may inhibit viral replication in vitro.9,10 Cyclosporine, for example, has been shown to inhibit the replication of several coronaviruses in vitro at noncytotoxic concentrations and independently of its immunosuppressive effect.10,11 In addition, the inhibitory effect of cyclosporine on hepatitis C virus replication in vitro is well documented.12However, the observed longer time to hepatitis C virus recurrence after liver transplantation in patients treatedwith cyclosporine comparedwith tacrolimus suggests a discordance in vivo between the different CNIs.12 Focusing explicitly on SARS-CoV infection, a genome-wide analysis of protein-protein interactionsbetweenSARS-CoVandhuman host proteins identified both cyclophilin family members and FK506 (tacrolimus)-binding proteins as interaction partners for SARS-CoV proteins.9 In addition, both FK506 treatment and knock down of FK506-binding proteins 1A and 1B inhibited SARS-CoV replication in vitro.13 This suggests that both commonly prescribed CNIs, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have inhibitory potential in SARS-CoV. Althoughwe do not advocate the use of these drugs for their potential antiviral properties based solely on these experimental observations in related viruses, these findings may support their continued use as the preferred maintenance immunosuppressant in transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, given that withdrawal of CNIs may result in increased corticosteroid usage in this population, it is also prudent to consider that there appears to be no therapeutic benefit from corticosteroid therapy in SARS-CoVand there maywell bedeleterious effects, acknowledging there are differences in the replacement dosage used in transplantation.14,15 Secondly, emerging evidence suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death after infection with SARS-CoV-2, and severe disease may be associated with a hyperinflammatory state","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Findings may support their continued use as the preferred maintenance immunosuppressant in transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the observed longer time to hepatitis C virus recurrence after liver transplantation in patients treated with cyclosporine compared with tacrolimus suggests a discordance in vivo between the different CNIs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1795,"details":{"paperId":"9043eb283e59eadd3bc6c3ffd0a1d4b92d3e5ce1","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7313521","MAG":"3036816996","DOI":"10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100148","CorpusId":"220042722","PubMed":"32632377"},"title":"COVID-19 and the rush for self-medication and self-dosing with ivermectin: A word of caution","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Editorial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Ivermectin (IVM), a derivative of the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis introduced in 1981, could easily be placed among such drugs as morphine (1827), aspirin (1899), and penicillin (1942), that are distinguished for their vital benefits to human and animal health."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5813,"details":{"paperId":"30fcd017c21fc5736d621c560aa22d624f8fcc87","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7105332","MAG":"3013336676","DOI":"10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023","CorpusId":"214716607","PubMed":"32256706"},"title":"COVID-19 and treatment with NSAIDs and corticosteroids: should we be limiting their use in the clinical setting?","abstract":"Given the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the availability of reliable information for clinicians and patients is paramount.

We conducted a single‐arm phase II trial of low‐dose tocilizumab in nonintubated hospitalized adult patients with COVID‐19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C‐reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 40 mg/L.

The first involves the growing use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the profound clinical cytokine storm and severe pneumonia in COVID‐19 patients. Instead, it is recommended to treat alternatively with their MSC‐released exosomes. This is because many reports in the literature and our data have shown that the release of exosomes from the in vivo administered MSC is actually responsible for their beneficial effects. Further, the exosomes are superior, simpler and clinically more convenient compared to their parental MSC. Additionally, in the context of COVID‐19, the known tendency of MSC to intravascularly aggregate causing lung dysfunction might synergize with the pneumonia aspects, and the tendency of MSC peripheral vascular micro aggregates might synergize with the vascular clots of the COVID‐19 disease process, causing significant central or peripheral vascular insufficiency. The second exosome therapeutic area for severe COVID‐19 involves use of convalescent plasma for its content of acquired immune antibodies that must consider the role in this therapy of contained nearly trillions of exosomes. Many of these derive from activated immune modulating cells and likely can function to transfer miRNAs that acting epigenetically to also influence the convalescent plasma recipient response to the virus. There is sufficient evidence, like recovery of patients with antibody deficiencies, to postulate that the antibodies actually have little effect and that immune resistance is principally due to T cell mechanisms. Further, COVID‐19 convalescent plasma has remarkably weak beneficial effects if compared to what was expected from many prior studies. This may be due to the dysfunctional immune response to the infection and resulting weak Ab that may be impaired further by antagonistic exosomes in the convalescent plasma. At the least, pre selection of plasma for the best antibodies and relevant exosomes would produce the most optimum therapy for very severely affected COVID‐19 patients.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Exosome extracellular vesicles as biologic therapy for COVID‐19 are discussed for two areas, including use of convalescent plasma for its content of acquired immune antibodies that must consider the role in this therapy of contained nearly trillions of exosomes."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":139,"details":{"paperId":"9437a6a9577dfb0c8b5a0d78121535e2bfa10250","externalIds":{"MAG":"3018605383","PubMedCentral":"7267424","DOI":"10.1002/biof.1633","CorpusId":"216594602","PubMed":"32339387"},"title":"COVID‐19, pulmonary mast cells, cytokine storms, and beneficial actions of luteolin","abstract":"Dear Editor The new coronavirus (severe acute pulmonary syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2) originated in China, where it spread rapidly, and has reached pandemic proportions because of its high rate of infectivity as well as high morbidity and mortality, associated with COVID-19.

A recent report correlated coronaviruses infection with activation of mast cells and subsequent cytokine storms in the lungs. Mast cells are known to be triggered by viruses. Mast cells are unique immune cells that are ubiquitous in the body, especially the lungs, and are critical for allergic and pulmonary diseases, including mastocytosis by secreting histamine, leukotrienes, and proteases. Mast cells are also involved in the development of inflammation via release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Mast cells contain the serine protease ACE2, which can convert angiotensin I into angiotensin II. In addition to the bronchoconstrictive action of mast cell-derived leukotrienes, mast cells cause further bronchoconstriction via an active renin-angiotensin generating system in the lungs. Moreover, mast cells express a number of serine proteases, especially the mast cell-serine protease tryptase, which are necessary for infection by SARSCoV-2. A serine protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, was recently shown to prevent entry of the virus into the lung cells of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. It would be important to not only inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 but also prevent SARS associated with COVID-19. The possible use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents has come into question for possibly aggravating pulmonary symptoms, while broad-spectrum immune suppressors, such as corticosteroids, would not be advisable given that an intact immune system is necessary to fight the infection and it may even lead to increased plasma viral load. Inhibition of mast cell-associated inflammation could be accomplished with natural molecules, especially the polyphenolic flavonoids. The flavone luteolin (not lutein, which is a carotenoid) has been shown to have broad antiviral properties. Luteolin specifically binds to the surface spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 and inhibits entry of the virus into host cells. Furthermore, luteolin inhibits serine proteases, including the SARS-CoV 3CL protease required for viral infectivity. Moreover, luteolin inhibits mast cells and has anti-inflammatory properties. A novel luteolin analogue, tetramethoxyluteolin, is even more potent and can also inhibit secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1β, as well as the chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 from human mast cells. Effective ways to administer luteolin would be those that overcome the poor oral absorption of flavones, as in the available liposomal formulation of luteolin (e.g., PureLut), mixed in olive pomace oil that has additional anti-inflammatory actions of its own.

The protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate has been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan and is currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. However, potential mechanisms of viral resistance as well as camostat mesylate metabolization and antiviral activity of metabolites are unclear. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can employ TMPRSS2-related host cell proteases for activation and that several of them are expressed in viral target cells. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by camostat mesylate. The camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited the activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat mesylate and was rapidly generated in the presence of serum. Importantly, the infection experiments in which camostat mesylate was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor involved preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate in the presence of serum for 2 h and thus allowed conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA. Indeed, when the antiviral activities of GBPA and camostat mesylate were compared in this setting, no major differences were identified. Our results indicate that use of TMPRSS2-related proteases for entry into target cells will not render SARS-CoV-2 camostat mesylate resistant.

This enzyme is a homologue of ACE1, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, is active in cardiovascular control, can be an element in cardiovascular disease, and is therapeutically targeted in hypertension and heart failure, using ACE1 inhibitors such as enalapril and lisinopril. The biology and therapeutic potential of ACE2 is much less clear. Commonly, it is viewed in the cardiovascular sphere as somehow antagonistic to the adverse effects of ACE1, and beneficial. This remains not well worked out, and currently there are no specific cardiovascular therapies involving ACE2. One action of ACE2 is to enzymatically cleave angiotensin II to angiotensin (1–7). Given the importance of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 entry to cells, cardiovascular illnesses or cardiovascular drugs, which increase ACE2 expression, and there are several important instances of this [2–6], may perhaps increase human SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and illness severity. We understand that hypertension increases the severity of COVID-19 illness. This is surprising, on two counts. First, ACE2 expression typically is reduced in hypertension models, and second, hypertension does not appear to impact other infections. One of us (M.E.), a cardiologist with more than four decades of hypertension tertiary care experience, cannot recall one of his patients ever dying from an infection. Infection predisposition in diabetes is evident, but not in hypertension. Perhaps in the COVID-19 pandemic, a new infection risk is arising from special properties of some antihypertensive drugs? Angiotensin receptor-blocker (ARB) drugs, now becoming the most commonly used antihypertensive drug class, typically increase ACE2 expression, often very substantially (perhaps two-fold to five-fold) [3–6]. This is sufficiently clear to have sometimes been used in marketing for ARBs, with a claim by pharmaceutical companies that this provides specific benefit in cardiovascular diseases. Perhaps, although this is unproven. With SARS-CoV-2 infection increased ACE2 expression very definitely would not be beneficial, and could be adverse. Increased ACE2 expression with angiotensin receptor blockers has been demonstrated in the kidneys and heart [4–6] but has not been tested to our knowledge, and this is now necessary, in the lungs.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is understood that hypertension increases the severity of COVID-19 illness, and the importance of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 entry to cells, cardiovascular illnesses or cardiovascular drugs, which increase ACE2 expression, and there are several important instances of this, may perhaps increase human Sars-Cov-2 infectivity and illness severity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1718,"details":{"paperId":"5dae82a2897ad6d9dab80439ab01027504cc8d8d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3017592751","PubMedCentral":"7175844","DOI":"10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109776","CorpusId":"216061448","PubMed":"32344313"},"title":"Can pioglitazone be potentially useful therapeutically in treating patients with COVID-19?","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosig litazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4906,"details":{"paperId":"5c63a0ce66f2eafd25aba7327d15bc9e2a9d24d2","externalIds":{"MAG":"3016590210","PubMedCentral":"7191632","DOI":"10.1152/ajpendo.00136.2020","CorpusId":"215795542","PubMed":"32297520"},"title":"Can spironolactone be used to prevent COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with hypertension?","abstract":"TO THE EDITOR: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6, 11, 12, 20, 23). Preliminary data on COVID-19 suggest hypertension to be correlated with worse outcomes (23.2%) compared with that of other metabolic disorders. This observation has been postulated to be correlated with use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) rather than hypertension. This alleged correlation has been disseminated among medical communities and media and has encouraged physicians to withdraw use of these drugs from COVID-19 patients. The potential harm from inappropriate discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs has led to communication (1, 5) recommending against withdrawal. Two recent reports (17, 18) have stated there are insufficient data to support speculations on the consequences of ACEIs/ARBs use in COVID-19. The hypothesized rationale for the possible (but controversial) correlation between ACEIs and ARBs and progression to ARDS in COVID-19 is based on reports that the receptorbinding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a strong interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2R) (7, 10, 13, 22). Hence, an increase in expression of ACE-2Rs attached to cell surfaces in lung endothelia could amplify the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to enter pulmonary cells. The only study to evaluate ACEI use for long periods demonstrated an increase in levels of angiotensin 1–7 (an indirect marker of ACE-2 action in the lung), which better reflects typical chronic use of ACEIs/ARBs (14). Although attached ACE-2 may allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its free circulating forms may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 by stopping coupling to membrane ACE-2Rs and consequent entry into pulmonary endothelial cells (1, 10, 21). Recombinant human soluble ACE-2 has been proposed to protect against ARDS and death in COVID-19 (2, 21). Soluble ACE-2 is commercially unavailable, unaffordable, produced at insufficient scales, and lacks definitive data (4). The circulating plasma level of ACE-2 may be insufficient to protect membrane-attached ACE-2Rs from coupling with SARS-CoV-2 (2), but, under particular conditions (e.g., soluble ACE-2), the protective actions of ACE-2 may become relevant. In addition to soluble ACE-2, potassium-sparing diuretics [another class of antihypertensive drug that also acts in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS)] and its main representative, spironolactone, have been reported to increase ACE-2 expression in plasma by 3to-5-fold (2, 9, 19), in contrast with the possibly unaffected plasma ACE-2 activity when using ACEIs/ARBs (2, 4, 8, 21) Spironolactone could, theoretically, reduce ACE-2 expression on lung-cell surfaces, because, unlike ACEIs/ARBs, it does not act in the pulmonary RAAS. Although renin levels are enhanced when using ACEIs, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics, the difference between the sites of blockade of renin effects may lead to a contrary metabolic microenvironment in the RAAS in the lungs (3, 15, 16). Hence, switching ACEIs/ARBs for spironolactone could address the above-mentioned concerns, because spironolactone can prevent the effects of ACEI/ARB withdrawal (2), which has not been considered previously (6–9). Furthermore, despite the outstanding quality of studies by Vaduganathan and colleagues (18) and South and coworkers (17), the differentiation between circulating and cell-surface levels of ACE-2 in those reports was blurred, which hampers accurate mechanistic analysis. The benefits of spironolactone, its extensively validated safety/risk profile, and its ability to substitute for ACEIs/ARBs appropriately would allow this switch without major ethical concerns in selected patients. With regard to the difference in ACE-2 activity in plasma and cell surfaces, use of ACEIs/ARBs could be a risk factor, but this is speculative and dependent on more robust data. Use of spironolactone may address issues of withdrawal of ACEIs/ ARBs and simultaneously rebalance plasma and cell-membrane levels of ACE-2.","publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The hypothesized rationale for the possible (but controversial) correlation between ACEIs and ARBs and progression to ARDS in COVID-19 is based on reports that the receptorbinding domain in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has a strong interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2R)."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":263,"details":{"paperId":"f095501f85d15ea7430702e407ef64e578a94624","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7307112","MAG":"3035093448","DOI":"10.1002/jmv.26165","CorpusId":"219606070","PubMed":"32530507"},"title":"Can steroids reverse the severe COVID‐19 induced “cytokine storm”?","abstract":"Severe coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) is characterized by an excessive proinflammatory cytokine storm, resulting in acute lung injury and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

In turn, the maneuverability margins of such hijacking appear to be so narrow that the modulation of the autophagy, regardless of whether using inducers or inhibitors (many of which are FDA-approved for the treatment of other diseases), is usually detrimental to viral replication, including SARS-CoV-2.

Acute Respiratory Discomfort Syndrome (ARDS) is the most common immunopathological event in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections. Fast lung deterioration results of cytokine storm determined by a robust immunological response leading to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Here, we show cysteine protease Cathepsin L (CatL) involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 from different points of view. CatL is a lysosomal enzyme that participates in numerous physiological processes, including apoptosis, antigen processing, and extracellular matrix remodeling. CatL is implicated in pathological conditions like invasion and metastasis of tumors, inflammatory status, atherosclerosis, renal disease, diabetes, bone diseases, viral infection, and other diseases. CatL expression is up-regulated during chronic inflammation and is involved in degrading extracellular matrix, an important process for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells. In addition, CatL is probably involved in processing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. As its inhibition is detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly exit from cells during late stages of infection, CatL could have been considered a valuable therapeutic target. Therefore, we describe here some drugs already in the market with potential CatL inhibiting capacity that could be used to treat COVID-19 patients.

Although derived from the CoV family, the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor. Here, we investigated whether HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung epithelial cell line. HCoV-EMC was able to replicate as efficiently as SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcriptomic changes before 12 h postinfection. Later in infection, HCoV-EMC induced a massive dysregulation of the host transcriptome, to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV. Both viruses induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway, but HCoV-EMC specifically down-regulated the expression of several genes within the antigen presentation pathway, including both type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. This could have an important impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response. A unique set of 207 genes was dysregulated early and permanently throughout infection with HCoV-EMC, and was used in a computational screen to predict potential antiviral compounds, including kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoids. Overall, HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV elicit distinct host gene expression responses, which might impact in vivo pathogenesis and could orient therapeutic strategies against that emergent virus. IMPORTANCE Identification of a novel coronavirus causing fatal respiratory infection in humans raises concerns about a possible widespread outbreak of severe respiratory infection similar to the one caused by SARS-CoV. Using a human lung epithelial cell line and global transcriptomic profiling, we identified differences in the host response between HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV. This enables rapid assessment of viral properties and the ability to anticipate possible differences in human clinical responses to HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV. We used this information to predict potential effective drugs against HCoV-EMC, a method that could be more generally used to identify candidate therapeutics in future disease outbreaks. These data will help to generate hypotheses and make rapid advancements in characterizing this new virus.

During the 2003 epidemic, the disease rapidly spread from its origin in southern China to other countries and affected almost 8000 patients, which resulted in about 800 fatalities. A chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease named 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is essential for the life cycle of the SARS-CoV. This main protease is responsible for maturation of functional proteins and represents a key anti-viral target. HPLC and fluorescence-based assays have been used to characterize the protease and to determine the potency of the inhibitors. The fluorogenic method monitoring the increase of fluorescence from the cleavage of a peptide substrate containing an Edans-Dabcyl fluorescence quenching pair at two ends has enabled the use of high throughput screening to speed up the drug discovery process. Several groups of inhibitors have been identified through high throughput screening and rational drug design approaches. Thus, alpha,beta-unsaturated peptidomimetics, anilides, metal-conjugated compounds, boronic acids, quinolinecarboxylate derivatives, thiophenecarboxylates, phthalhydrazide-substituted ketoglutamine analogues, isatin and natural products have been identified as potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV main protease. The different classes of inhibitors reported in these studies are summarized in this review.

ABSTRACT The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 acts as the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the other members of the Coronaviridae family SARS-CoV-1 and HCoV-NL63. Here, we report the biophysical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 spike variants D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 with affinities to the ACE2 receptor and infectivity capacity, revealing weaknesses in the developed neutralizing antibody approaches. Furthermore, we report a preclinical characterization package for a soluble receptor decoy engineered to be catalytically inactive and immunologically inert, with broad neutralization capacity, that represents an attractive therapeutic alternative in light of the mutational landscape of COVID-19. This construct efficiently neutralized four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The decoy also displays antibody-like biophysical properties and manufacturability, strengthening its suitability as a first-line treatment option in prophylaxis or therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 and related viral infections. IMPORTANCE Mutational drift of SARS-CoV-2 risks rendering both therapeutics and vaccines less effective. Receptor decoy strategies utilizing soluble human ACE2 may overcome the risk of viral mutational escape since mutations disrupting viral interaction with the ACE2 decoy will by necessity decrease virulence, thereby preventing meaningful escape. The solution described here of a soluble ACE2 receptor decoy is significant for the following reasons: while previous ACE2-based therapeutics have been described, ours has novel features, including (i) mutations within ACE2 to remove catalytical activity and systemic interference with the renin/angiotensin system, (ii) abrogated FcγR engagement, reduced risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, and reduced risk of hyperinflammation, and (iii) streamlined antibody-like purification process and scale-up manufacturability indicating that this receptor decoy could be produced quickly and easily at scale.

Recent pediatric data suggest that existing World Health Organization (WHO) dosing guidelines for children with malaria are suboptimal. The aim of our study was to establish best‐evidence to inform pediatric CHQ doses for children infected with COVID‐19. A previously developed physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CHQ was used to simulate exposure in adults and children and verified against published pharmacokinetic data. The COVID‐19 recommended adult dosage regimen of 44 mg/kg total was tested in adults and children to evaluate the extent of variation in exposure. Based on differences in area under the concentration‐time curve from zero to 70 hours (AUC0–70h) the optimal CHQ dose was determined in children of different ages compared with adults. Revised doses were re‐introduced into the model to verify that overall CHQ exposure in each age band was within 5% of the predicted adult value. Simulations showed differences in drug exposure in children of different ages and adults when the same body‐weight based dose is given. As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0–1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1–6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months–12 years, and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3,300 mg in any patient.

Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc>500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient.

In this study, a database containing structural information of more than 8,000 existing drugs was virtually screened by a docking approach to identify potential binding molecules of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. As a target for screening, both a homology model and the crystallographic structure of the binding pocket of the enzyme were used. Cinanserin (SQ 10,643), a well-characterized serotonin antagonist that has undergone preliminary clinical testing in humans in the 1960s, showed a high score in the screening and was chosen for further experimental evaluation. Binding of both cinanserin and its hydrochloride to bacterially expressed 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and the related human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance technology. The catalytic activity of both enzymes was inhibited with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 5 μM, as tested with a fluorogenic substrate. The antiviral activity of cinanserin was further evaluated in tissue culture assays, namely, a replicon system based on HCoV-229E and quantitative test assays with infectious SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E. All assays revealed a strong inhibition of coronavirus replication at nontoxic drug concentrations. The level of virus RNA and infectious particles was reduced by up to 4 log units, with IC50 values ranging from 19 to 34 μM.

Both published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and confounding-adjusted observational studies which met our predefined eligibility criteria were collected. We included studies investigating the effect of pharmacological management of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 management. Mild patients who do not require hospitalization or have self-limiting disease courses were not eligible for our NMA. A total of 110 studies (40 RCTs and 70 observational studies) were included. PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, SSRN, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from the beginning of 2020 to August 24, 2020. Studies from Asia (41 countries, 37.2%), Europe (28 countries, 25.4%), North America (24 countries, 21.8%), South America (5 countries, 4.5%), and Middle East (6 countries, 5.4%), and additional 6 multinational studies (5.4%) were included in our analyses. The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to severe disease (severe pneumonia, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and/or mechanical ventilation), viral clearance rate, QT prolongation, fatal cardiac complications, and noncardiac serious adverse events. Based on RCTs, the risk of progression to severe course and mortality was significantly reduced with corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.86, p = 0.032, and OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91, p = 0.002, respectively) and remdesivir (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.50, p < 0.001, and OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.98, p = 0.041, respectively) compared to standard care for moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in non-ICU; corticosteroids were also shown to reduce mortality rate (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73, p < 0.001) for critically ill patients in ICU. In analyses including observational studies, interferon-alpha (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.39, p = 0.004), itolizumab (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.92, p = 0.042), sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.88, p = 0.030), anakinra (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.82, p = 0.019), tocilizumab (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.60, p < 0.001), and convalescent plasma (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.96, p = 0.038) were associated with reduced mortality rate in non-ICU setting, while high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.49, p = 0.003), ivermectin (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57, p = 0.005), and tocilizumab (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.90, p = 0.012) were associated with reduced mortality rate in critically ill patients. Convalescent plasma was the only treatment option that was associated with improved viral clearance rate at 2 weeks compared to standard care (OR 11.39, 95% CI 3.91 to 33.18, p < 0.001). The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was shown to be associated with increased QT prolongation incidence (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.20, p = 0.003) and fatal cardiac complications in cardiac-impaired populations (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.00, p = 0.007). No drug was significantly associated with increased noncardiac serious adverse events compared to standard care. The quality of evidence of collective outcomes were estimated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The major limitation of the present study is the overall low level of evidence that reduces the certainty of recommendations. Besides, the risk of bias (RoB) measured by RoB2 and ROBINS-I framework for individual studies was generally low to moderate. The outcomes deducted from observational studies could not infer causality and can only imply associations. The study protocol is publicly available on PROSPERO (CRD42020186527).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this NMA, we found that anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids, tocilizumab, anakinra, and IVIG), convalescent plasma, and remdesivir were associated with improved outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine did not provide clinical benefits while posing cardiac safety risks when combined with azithromycin, especially in the vulnerable population. Only 29% of current evidence on pharmacological management of COVID-19 is supported by moderate or high certainty and can be translated to practice and policy; the remaining 71% are of low or very low certainty and warrant further studies to establish firm conclusions.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A systematic review and network meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions and the level of evidence behind each treatment regimen in different clinical settings found that corticosteroids reduced the risk of progression to severe course and mortality with COVID-19 patients in non-ICU."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3597,"details":{"paperId":"d3ddb25adb2d3c6f60457d515e82784958135456","externalIds":{"MAG":"2165324863","DOI":"10.1099/VIR.0.81579-0","CorpusId":"27078041","PubMed":"16476986"},"title":"Comparative evaluation of two severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine candidates in mice challenged with SARS coronavirus.","abstract":"Two different severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine strategies were evaluated for their ability to protect against live SARS coronavirus (CoV) challenge in a murine model of infection. A whole killed (inactivated by beta-propiolactone) SARS-CoV vaccine and a combination of two adenovirus-based vectors, one expressing the nucleocapsid (N) and the other expressing the spike (S) protein (collectively designated Ad S/N), were evaluated for the induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses and their ability to protect against pulmonary SARS-CoV replication. The whole killed virus (WKV) vaccine given subcutaneously to 129S6/SvEv mice was more effective than the Ad S/N vaccine administered either intranasally or intramuscularly in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in the murine respiratory tract. This protective ability of the WKV vaccine correlated with the induction of high serum neutralizing-antibody titres, but not with cellular immune responses as measured by gamma interferon secretion by mouse splenocytes. Titres of serum neutralizing antibodies induced by the Ad S/N vaccine administered intranasally or intramuscularly were significantly lower than those induced by the WKV vaccine.

While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQ-related transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants.

It is essential to identify specific diagnostic agents and antiviral vaccine candidates to fight this highly contagious disease. Methods: We generated 14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein and used these to thoroughly map the N protein antigenic determinants. We identified the immunodominant antigenic sites responsible for the antibodies in sera from SARS patients and antisera from small animals and differentiated the linear from the conformational antibody-combining sites comprising the natural epitopes by use of yeast surface display. Results: We identified 5 conformational and 3 linear epitopes within the entire N protein; 3 conformational and 3 linear epitopes were immunodominant. The antibody responses to the N protein fragments in mammalian sera revealed that 3 regions of the N protein are strong antigenic domains.

Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (−53.35 vs. −46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding.

As of October 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in over 189 countries, has infected over 40 million people, and is responsible for more than 1 million deaths. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 40 million people worldwide, with over 1 million deaths as of October 2020 and with multiple efforts in the development and testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines under way. In order to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution and drug targets, we investigated how and to what extent the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence differs from those of other well-characterized human and animal coronavirus genomes, as well as how polymorphic SARS-CoV-2 genomes are generally. We ultimately sought to identify features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that may contribute to its viral replication, host pathogenicity, and vulnerabilities. Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host-microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3′-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on the results of multiple computational target prediction analyses and an assessment of similar interactions involving the influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3′-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3′-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation. IMPORTANCE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is having a dramatic global effect on public health and the economy. As of October 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in over 189 countries, has infected over 40 million people, and is responsible for more than 1 million deaths. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is small but complex, and its functions and interactions with human host factors are being studied extensively. The significance of our study is that, using extensive SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis techniques, we identified potential interacting human host microRNA targets that share similarity with those of influenza A virus H1N1. Our study results will allow the development of virus-host interaction models that will enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and motivate the exploitation of both the interacting viral and host factors as therapeutic targets.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The study identifies potential interacting human host microRNA targets that share similarity with those of influenza A virus H1N1 and provides evidence for a possible host-microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3′-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1948,"details":{"paperId":"f19072d0d6091494f7a6d328c29ac8f15467acd9","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7103409","MAG":"2131356259","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2008.09.029","CorpusId":"18069343","PubMed":"18986662"},"title":"Conserved amino acids W423 and N424 in receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV are potential targets for therapeutic monoclonal antibody","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Two monoclonal antibodies, targeting RBD, with marked virus neutralizing activity are generated, indicating that the W423 and N424 residues are the most critical in the epitope which is a novel potential target for therapeutic mAbs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4916,"details":{"paperId":"86988fd07f6282e69b0e99be6f71dcb7f6cefe85","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7347959","MAG":"3033778103","DOI":"10.1152/ajplung.00146.2020","CorpusId":"219561660","PubMed":"32519892"},"title":"Consideration of Pannexin 1 channels in COVID-19 pathology and treatment","abstract":"Pannexin1 (PANX1) is a ubiquitously expressed, channel-forming protein found in a number of tissues thoughout the body (e.g. lung, vasculature, liver, central nervous system, immune system) that is important in many key physiological and immune responses.

A randomized clinical trial","abstract":"Background After recovery from COVID-19, most patients have anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Their convalescent plasma could be an inexpensive and widely available treatment for COVID-19. Methods The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15. Results The trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care. Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission.

Four patients without coexisting diseases received convalescent plasma around hospital day 20, and a patient with hypertension and mitral valve insufficiency received the plasma transfusion at day 10. The donor plasma had demonstrable IgG and IgM anti– SARS-CoV-19 antibodies and neutralized the virus in in vitro cultures. Although these patients continued to receive antiviral treatment primarily with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon, the use of convalescent plasma may have contributed to their recovery because the clinical status of all patients had improvement approximately 1 week after transfusion, as evidenced by normalization of body temperature as well as improvements in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and PAO2/FIO2 ratio. In addition, the patients’ neutralizing antibody titers increased and respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 and 12 days after transfusion. Even though the cases in the report by Shen et al are compelling and well-studied, this investigation has important limitations that are characteristic of other “anecdotal” case series. The intervention, administration of convalescent plasma, was not evaluated in a randomized clinical trial, and the outcomes in the treatment group were not compared with outcomes in a control group of patients who did not receive the intervention. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the true clinical effect of this intervention or whether patients might have recovered without this therapy. In addition, patients received numerous other therapies (including antiviral agents and steroids), making it impossible to disentangle the specific contribution of convalescent plasma to the clinical course or outcomes. Moreover, convalescent plasma was administered up to 3 weeks after hospital admission, and it is unclear whether this timing is optimal or if earlier administration might have been associated with different clinical outcomes. Despite these limitations, the study does provide some evidence to support the possibility of evaluating this well-known therapy in more rigorous investigations involving patients with COVID-19 and severe illness. The use of convalescent plasma is not new; it was used for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1), avian influenza A (H5N1), several hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, and other viral infections. For instance, in 2005, Cheng et al reported outcomes of patients who received convalescent plasma in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS outbreak.2 Although this investigation was not a randomized trial, of 1775 patients, the 80 who received convalescent plasma had a lower mortality rate (12.5%) compared with the overall SARS-related mortality for admitted patients (n = 299 [17%]). The antibody titers and plasma transfusion volumes varied and did not appear to correlate with clinical response; however, patients receiving transfusion within 14 days of symptom onset (n = 33) had better outcomes. No adverse events were reported among patients receiving convalescent plasma. Despite the potential utility of passive antibody treatments, there have been few concerted efforts to use them as initial therapies against emerging and pandemic infectious threats. The absence of large trials certainly contributes to the hesitancy to employ this treatment. Also, the most effective formulations (convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin, H-Ig) are unknown. Convalescent plasma has the advantage that while its antibodies limit viral replication, other plasma components can also exert beneficial effects such as replenishing coagulation factors when given to patients with hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola.3-5 On the other hand, individual convalescent plasma units demonstrate donordependent variability in antibody specificities and titers. H-Ig preparations, in contrast, contain standardized antibody doses, although fractionation removes IgM, which may be necessary against some viruses. Nonetheless, the construction of a strategic stockpile of frozen, pathogen-reduced plasma, collected from Ebola-convalescent patients with wellcharacterized viral neutralization activities, is one example of how to proceed despite existing unknowns.6 Deploying passive antibody therapies against the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases provides an unprecedented opportunity to perform clinical studies of the efficacy of this treatment against a viral agent. If the results of rigorously conducted investigations, such as a large-scale randomized clinical trial, demonstrate efficacy, use of this therapy also could help change the course of this pandemic.4 Shen et al used apheresis products produced in the hospital.1 How could this be scaled to meet increased demands? One approach would be to combine the use of convalescent plasma and H-Ig in a complementary way to treat infected patients in the current COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent infectious Related article","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Findings from a preliminary study of 5 severely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who were treated in the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, China, using plasma from recovered individuals provide some evidence to support the possibility of evaluating this well-known therapy in more rigorous investigations involving patients with COVID-19 and severe illness."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2117,"details":{"paperId":"d23052795224f15641e1d575eb646bdfe94d9b17","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7128218","MAG":"3008954191","DOI":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30141-9","CorpusId":"211727419","PubMed":"32113510"},"title":"Convalescent plasma as a potential therapy for COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The observing system, as a proactive infection control tool, provides immediate prevention against nosocomial infection in negative pressure isolation wards, which offers creative assistance to combat the COVID-19 outbreak."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4007,"details":{"paperId":"8c579a08e5b7ed1a3c45e7712f059378d307feec","externalIds":{"MAG":"3084108593","DOI":"10.1101/2020.09.03.20187252","CorpusId":"221534680"},"title":"Convalescent plasma in the management of moderate COVID-19 in India: An open-label parallel-arm phase II multicentre randomized controlled trial (PLACID Trial)","abstract":"Objectives: Convalescent plasma (CP) as a passive source of neutralizing antibodies and immunomodulators is a century-old therapeutic option used for the management of viral diseases.

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required.  OBJECTIVES: To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID-19.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 4 June 2020.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-controlled NRSIs.  MAIN RESULTS: This is the first living update of our review. We included 20 studies (1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs, 16 non-controlled NRSIs) with 5443 participants, of whom 5211 received convalescent plasma, and identified a further 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are randomised. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. Overall risk of bias of included studies was high, due to study design, type of participants, and other previous or concurrent treatments. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19  We included results from four controlled studies (1 RCT (stopped early) with 103 participants, of whom 52 received convalescent plasma; and 3 controlled NRSIs with 236 participants, of whom 55 received convalescent plasma) to assess effectiveness of convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (1 controlled NRSI, 21 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.31; very low-certainty evidence). Time to death (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma prolongs time to death (RCT: hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.82; controlled NRSI: HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms, assessed by need for respiratory support (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on improvement of clinical symptoms at seven days (RCT: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19), 14 days (RCT: RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.77; controlled NRSI: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29), and 28 days (RCT: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.81; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life No studies reported this outcome.  Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from 1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs and 10 non-controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events was variable. The controlled studies reported on adverse events and serious adverse events only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. The duration of follow-up varied. Some, but not all, studies included death as a serious adverse event.  Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (13 studies, 201 participants) The studies did not report the grade of adverse events. Thirteen studies (201 participants) reported on adverse events of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these adverse events were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).  Serious adverse events (14 studies, 5201 participants)  Fourteen studies (5201 participants) reported on serious adverse events. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (5000 participants), which reported only on serious adverse events limited to the first four hours after convalescent plasma transfusion. This study included death as a serious adverse event; they reported 15 deaths, four of which they classified as potentially, probably or definitely related to transfusion. Other serious adverse events reported in all studies were predominantly allergic or respiratory in nature, including anaphylaxis, transfusion-associated dyspnoea, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma affects the number of serious adverse events.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nWe are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For safety outcomes we also included non-controlled NRSIs. There was limited information regarding adverse events. Of the controlled studies, none reported on this outcome in the control group. There is only very low-certainty evidence for safety of convalescent plasma for COVID-19.  While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, problems with recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies are conceivable. The early termination of the first RCT investigating convalescent plasma, and the multitude of studies registered in the past months illustrate this. It is therefore necessary to critically assess the design of these registered studies, and well-designed studies should be prioritised. Other considerations for these studies are the need to report outcomes for all study arms in the same way, and the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co-interventions administered in all study arms.  There are 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are RCTs. This is the first living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically. These updates may show different results to those reported here.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID-19, a first living update of this review is published."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":248,"details":{"paperId":"287735a8544d644e37bdf9588e48913da5b76c8a","externalIds":{"MAG":"3023698370","PubMedCentral":"7267113","DOI":"10.1002/jmv.25961","CorpusId":"218474057","PubMed":"32356910"},"title":"Convalescent plasma transfusion for the treatment of COVID‐19: Systematic review","abstract":"Abstract The recent emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has reassessed the usefulness of historic convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT). This review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CPT therapy in COVID‐19 patients based on the publications reported till date. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on convalescent plasma on clinically relevant outcomes in individuals with COVID‐19. PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline databases were searched upto 19 April 2020. All records were screened as per the protocol eligibility criteria. We included five studies reporting CPT to COVID‐19 patients.

The authors suggest, on an in vitro experiment results basis, an alternative HCQ dose regimen for future clinical trials while several clinical trials on chloroquine (CQ)and HCQ-based regimens for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) are still ongoing [1]. Taking into account the antiviral in vitro effect, CQ has been considered to be a valuable candidate, alone or in combination with lopinavir, for further testing in animal models or direct off-label use for coronavirus-related diseases [2]. Unfortunately, CQ did not show efficacy in inhibiting viral replication in a mouse SARS-CoV model [3]. Nevertheless, by considering its anti-inflammatory properties, it has been postulated that CQ/ HCQ may have some effect on SARS [3, 4]—in particular, by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α], interleukin [IL] 6) and consequently blocking the subsequent cascade of events which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4]. Due to the aforementioned evidence, the negligible cost, its large worldwide use, and the known safety profile, CQ/ HCQ has been considered as a potentially useful drug in patients affected by SARSCoV-2 [1, 5, 6] Despite in vitro activity in inhibiting the growth of several viruses, to date no acute virus infection has been successfully treated by CQ/HCQ [7]. Moreover, CQ showed a paradoxical effect when administered in treating Chikungunya virus infection: in a prophylactic study in a nonhuman primate model the infection was enhanced by CQ treatment; in a curative study in a human cohort, CQ did not affect the acute phase of the disease, in term of symptoms and viral clearance, but the chronic complications of Chikungunya were more frequent in the treated group compared with the control group. This paradoxical effect has been explained by a delay in immune adaptive response to the virus provoked by CQ administration that could nullify the antiviral activity shown in vitro [8]. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown; however, preliminary studies have shown differences with respect to SARS pathogenesis. In particular, an initial increase in the secretion of T helper (Th)-2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10), which suppress inflammation [9], has been shown and which could balance the Th-1 cell hyper-response that is supposed to lead to ARDS in patients affected by SARS [4]. It has been demonstrated that CQ inhibits T-cell proliferation by reducing IL-2 production and IL-2 responsiveness [10], and it seems that IL-2 plays a crucial role in “priming” T cells for Th-2 cell differentiation [11]. Therefore, if Th-2 cell response could play a role in suppressing inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection [9], it cannot be excluded that CQ/HCQ negatively impacts the immune response to the virus.

There were 12 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes on spike, including two sites on the RBD and one on the N-terminal domain (NTD), that displayed cross-neutralization of VOCs, for which distinct antibody targets could neutralize discrete variants. ABSTRACT Several severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have arisen that exhibit increased viral transmissibility and partial evasion of immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination. To address the specific antibody targets that were affected by recent viral variants, we generated 43 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Viral variants harboring mutations at K417, E484, and N501 could escape most of the highly potent antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD). Despite this, we identified 12 neutralizing mAbs against three distinct regions of the spike protein that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOCs), including B.1.1.7 (alpha), P.1 (gamma), and B.1.617.2 (delta). Notably, antibodies targeting distinct epitopes could neutralize discrete variants, suggesting that different variants may have evolved to disrupt the binding of particular neutralizing antibody classes. These results underscore that humans exposed to the first pandemic wave of prototype SARS-CoV-2 possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern. IMPORTANCE We describe the binding and neutralization properties of a new set of human monoclonal antibodies derived from memory B cells of 10 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent donors in the first pandemic wave of prototype SARS-CoV-2. There were 12 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes on spike, including two sites on the RBD and one on the N-terminal domain (NTD), that displayed cross-neutralization of VOCs, for which distinct antibody targets could neutralize discrete variants. This work underlines that natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 induces effective cross-neutralization against only some VOCs and supports the need for COVID-19 vaccination for robust induction of neutralizing antibodies targeting multiple epitopes of the spike protein to combat the current SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and any others that might emerge in the future.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results underscore that humans exposed to the first pandemic wave of prototype SARS-CoV-2 possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1378,"details":{"paperId":"3b6f87cec93dc7857f91387a13f098313834fbcb","externalIds":{"MAG":"3109842873","PubMedCentral":"7687367","DOI":"10.1016/j.immuni.2020.10.023","CorpusId":"227162980","PubMed":"33242394"},"title":"Cross-Neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 Antibody to a Functionally Conserved Site Is Mediated by Avidity","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The crystal structure of the COVA1-16 antibody fragment with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and negative-stain electron microscopy reconstructions with the spike glycoprotein trimer are determined to elucidate the structural basis of its cross-reactivity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2737,"details":{"paperId":"2b76d694265643df9671ce59e72491baab829231","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y","CorpusId":"256822613"},"title":"Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Several monoclonal antibodies that target the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which was identified from memory B cells of an individual who was infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS- coV) in 2003, and one antibody (named S309) potently neutralization, which may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2643,"details":{"paperId":"b005a01a7dba51c636916f5d0755e0d10d6334fd","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8476643","MAG":"3169076315","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-25997-3","CorpusId":"236288891","PubMed":"34580306"},"title":"Cross-neutralizing antibodies bind a SARS-CoV-2 cryptic site and resist circulating variants","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Two cross-neutralizing antibodies are obtained that target Sarbecoviruses’ receptor-binding domain (RBD) with sub-picomolar affinities and potently neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":950,"details":{"paperId":"f727683ec243e9b1ea8b80265c51c7cef72ddafd","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107725","CorpusId":"231769859","PubMed":"33500101"},"title":"Cross-reactive Antibody Response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Infections.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3660,"details":{"paperId":"5849716920855b375b746c787a8ef0373e24bd9d","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7239046","MAG":"3011805804","DOI":"10.1101/2020.03.15.993097","CorpusId":"214726330","PubMed":"32511317"},"title":"Cross-reactive antibody response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections","abstract":"The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic.

As of the beginning of April 2021, pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 130 million people and led to more than 2.84 million deaths. Given the severity of the epidemic, scientists from academia and industry are rushing to identify antiviral strategies to combat the disease. There are several strategies in antiviral drugs for coronaviruses including empirical testing of known antiviral drugs, large-scale phenotypic screening of compound libraries and target-based drug discovery. To date, an increasing number of drugs have been shown to have anti-coronavirus activities in vitro and in vivo, but only remdesivir and several neutralizing antibodies have been approved by the US FDA for treating COVID-19. However, remdesivir’s clinical effects are controversial and new antiviral drugs are still urgently needed. We will discuss the current status of the drug discovery efforts against COVID-19 and potential future directions. With the ever-increasing movability of human population and globalization of world economy, emerging and reemerging viral infectious diseases seriously threaten public health. Particularly the past and ongoing outbreaks of coronaviruses cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases in infected animals and human (Woo et al., 2009). The human coronavirus (HCoV) strains (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) usually cause common cold with mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. By contrast, the emergence of three deadly human betacoronaviruses, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) (Zaki et al., 2012), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Lee et al., 2003), the SARS-CoV-2 (Jin et al., 2020a) highlight the need to identify new treatment strategies for viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 disease named by World Health Organization (WHO) (Zhu N. et al., 2020). This disease manifests as either an asymptomatic infection or a mild to severe pneumonia. This pandemic disease causes extent morbidity and mortality in the whole world, especially regions out of China. Similar to SARS and MERS, the SARS CoV-2 genome encodes four structural proteins, sixteen non-structural proteins (nsp) and accessory proteins. The structural proteins include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleoprotein (N). The spike glycoprotein directly recognizes and engages cellular receptors during viral entry. The four non-structural proteins including papain-like protease (PLpro), 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are key enzymes involved in viral transcription and replication. The spike and the four key enzymes were considered attractive targets to develop antiviral agents (Zumla et al., 2016). The catalytic sites of the four enzymes of SARS-CoV2 share high similarities with SARS CoV and MERS in genomic sequences (Morse et al., 2020). Besides, the structures of the key drug-binding pockets are highly conserved among the three coronaviruses (Morse et al., 2020). Therefore, it follows naturally that existing anti-SARS-CoV and anti-MERS drugs targeting these enzymes can be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2. Based on previous studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is anticipated a number of therapeutics can be used to control or prevent emerging infectious disease COVID-19 (Li and de Clercq, 2020; Wang et al., 2020c; Ita, 2021), these include small-molecule drugs, peptides, and monoclonal antibodies. Given the urgency of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, here we discuss the discovery and development of new therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the strategies from which the new drugs are derived.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The current status of the drug discovery efforts against COVID-19 and potential future directions is

Science, this issue p. eabc8511, p. 1210 Immune responses of COVID-19 patients are cataloged and compared with those of healthy individuals. INTRODUCTION Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, present with severe respiratory disease requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Although most patients recover, disease is complex and case fatality can be as high as 10%. How human immune responses control or exacerbate COVID-19 is currently poorly understood, and defining the nature of immune responses during acute COVID-19 could help identify therapeutics and effective vaccines. RATIONALE Immune dysregulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection has been implicated in pathogenesis, but currently available data remain limited. We used high-dimensional cytometry to analyze COVID-19 patients and compare them with recovered and healthy individuals and performed integrated analysis of ~200 immune features. These data were combined with ~50 clinical features to understand how the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be related to clinical patterns, disease severity, and progression. RESULTS Analysis of 125 hospitalized COVID-19 patients revealed that although CD4 and CD8 T cells were activated in some patients, T cell responses were limited in others. In many patients, CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation (measured by KI67 increase) and activation (detected by CD38 and HLA-DR coexpression) were consistent with antiviral responses observed in other infections. Plasmablast (PB) responses were present in many patients, reaching >30% of total B cells, and most patients made SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies. However, ~20% of patients had little T cell activation or PB response compared with controls. In some patients, responses declined over time, resembling typical kinetics of antiviral responses; in others, however, robust T cell and PB responses remained stable or increased over time. These temporal patterns were associated with specific clinical features. With an unbiased uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) approach, we distilled ~200 immune parameters into two major immune response components and a third pattern lacking robust adaptive immune responses, thus revealing immunotypes of COVID-19: (i) Immunotype 1 was associated with disease severity and showed robust activated CD4 T cells, a paucity of circulating follicular helper cells, activated CD8 “EMRAs,” hyperactivated or exhausted CD8 T cells, and PBs. (ii) Immunotype 2 was characterized by less CD4 T cell activation, Tbet+ effector CD4 and CD8 T cells, and proliferating memory B cells and was not associated with disease severity. (iii) Immunotype 3, which negatively correlated with disease severity and lacked obvious activated T and B cell responses, was also identified. Mortality occurred for patients with all three immunotypes, illustrating a complex relationship between immune response and COVID-19. CONCLUSION Three immunotypes revealing different patterns of lymphocyte responses were identified in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These three major patterns may each represent a different suboptimal response associated with hospitalization and disease. Our findings may have implications for treatments focused on activating versus inhibiting the immune response. High-dimensional immune response analysis of COVID-19 patients identifies three immunotypes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell immune profiling and clinical data were collected from 60 healthy donors (HDs), 36 recovered donors (RDs), and 125 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. High-dimensional flow cytometry and longitudinal analysis highlighted stability and fluctuations in the response. UMAP visualization distilled ~200 immune features into two dimensions and identified three immunotypes associated with clinical outcomes. cTfh, circulating T follicular helper cells; EMRA, a subset of effector memory T cells reexpressing CD45RA; d0, day 0. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic, but human immune responses to the virus remain poorly understood. We used high-dimensional cytometry to analyze 125 COVID-19 patients and compare them with recovered and healthy individuals. Integrated analysis of ~200 immune and ~50 clinical features revealed activation of T cell and B cell subsets in a proportion of patients. A subgroup of patients had T cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection and plasmablast responses reaching >30% of circulating B cells. However, another subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable with that in uninfected individuals.

Off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries and tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source for solutions. Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, there is no central repository of off-label uses to facilitate immediate identification and selection of potentially useful interventions during public health crises. Using the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse of the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and targeted toward the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so deadly. This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate are worth considering for patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course.

ABSTRACT The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed serious threats to global public health and economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we first verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor and that its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. The heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased α-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR2) site, than the HR1 sequence in S2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Then, we designed an HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly potent activities in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus transduction. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 was characterized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the results presented here provide important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.

Most of the patients with COVID-19 suffer from mild flu-like illnesses such as cold and fever; however, few percentages of the patients progress from severe illness to death, mostly in an immunocompromised individual. The causative agent of COVID-19 is an RNA virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite these debilitating conditions, no medication to stop the disease progression or vaccination is available till now. Therefore, we aimed to formulate a multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing an immunoinformatics approach. For this purpose, we used the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to determine the immunodominant T- and B-cell epitopes. After rigorous assessment, we designed a vaccine construct using four potential epitopes from each of the three epitope classes such as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, helper T-lymphocyte, and linear B-lymphocyte epitopes. The designed vaccine was antigenic, immunogenic, and non-allergenic with suitable physicochemical properties and has higher solubility. More importantly, the predicted vaccine structure was similar to the native protein. Further investigations indicated a strong and stable binding interaction between the vaccine and the toll-like receptor (TLR4). Strong binding stability and structural compactness were also evident in molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the computer-generated immune simulation showed that the vaccine could trigger real-life-like immune responses upon administration into humans. Finally, codon optimization based on Escherichia coli K12 resulted in optimal GC content and higher CAI value followed by incorporating it into the cloning vector pET28+(a). Overall, these results suggest that the designed peptide vaccine can serve as an excellent prophylactic candidate against SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Considering that the pandemic is a recent event, no large clinical trials have been possible and since coronavirus specific drug are not yet available, there is no strong consensus on how to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated viral pneumonia. Coronaviruses code for an important multifunctional enzyme named papain-like protease (PLP), that has many roles in pathogenesis. First, PLP is one of the two viral cysteine proteases, along with 3-chymotripsin-like protease, that is responsible for the production of the replicase proteins required for viral replication. Second, its intrinsic deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities serve to antagonize the host’s immune response that would otherwise hinder infection. Both deubiquitinating and deISGylating functions involve the removal of the small regulatory polypeptides, ubiquitin and ISG15, respectively, from target proteins. Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response. PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro.

Screening of the 3 libraries resulted in the identification of several novel compounds that effectively inhibited the CPE of SARS CoV in vitro—compounds which will serve as excellent lead candidates for further evaluation.

Most recently SARS-CoV-2 virus (causing COVID-19) has led to a pandemic with no successful therapeutics. The SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on trimeric spike (S) proteins to facilitate virus entry into host cells by binding to ACE2 receptor on host cell membranes. Therefore, blocking this interaction with antibodies are promising agents against SARS-CoV-2. Here we describe using humanized llama antibody VHHs against SARS-CoV-2 that would overcome the limitations associated with polyclonal and monoclonal combination therapies. From two llama VHH libraries, unique humanized VHHs that bind to S protein and block the S/ACE2 interaction were identified. Furthermore, pairwise combination of VHHs showed synergistic blocking. Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an in-silico approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains. Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD – 0.25 nM, IC100 ∼ 36.7 nM, IC95 ∼ 12.2 nM, IC50 ∼ 1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs.

Not so fast.","abstract":"Recent announcements indicated, without sharing any distinct published set of results, that the corticosteroid dexamethasone may reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients only. The recent Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]-associated multiorgan disease, called COVID-19, has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Defense against this Corona virus requires activated T cells and specific antibodies. Instead, cytokines are responsible for the serious sequelae of COVID-19 that damage the lungs. Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs.

Changes in biomarkers and clinical parameters were compared during the 7-day period among COVID-19 patients, and also according to dexamethasone use. Thirty-two patients with severe COVID-19 who received mechanical ventilation (n = 6), high-flow nasal cannula (n = 11), and supplemental oxygen (n = 15) were analyzed.

The 7-day decreases in biomarkers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2] and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]) and sRAGE, but not in the biomarker of lung epithelial injury (surfactant protein D), were correlated with decreases in C-reactive protein and radiologic score at day 7. Twenty patients (63%) received dexamethasone, and the dexamethasone and non-dexamethasone groups differed in terms of disease severity. However, dexamethasone was associated marginally with increased SpO2/FiO2 and significantly with decreases in C-reactive protein and radiologic score after adjusting for baseline imbalances. Furthermore, the dexamethasone group exhibited a significant decrease in the concentrations of Ang-2, ICAM-1, soluble form of the Tie2 receptor (a biomarker of glycocalyx shedding), and sRAGE.

This study aimed at the nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) helicase as a promising target for drug development against COVID-19. A unique collection of nucleoside analogs was screened against the SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein, for which a molecular docking experiment was executed to depict the selected ligand’s binding affinity with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase proteins. Simultaneously, molecular dynamic simulations were performed to examine the protein’s binding site’s conformational stability, flexibility, and interaction with the ligands. Key nucleoside ligands were selected for pharmacokinetic analysis based on their docking scores. Selected ligands (cordycepin and pritelivir) showed excellent pharmacokinetics and were well stabilized at the proteins’ binding site throughout the MD simulation. We have also performed binding free energy analysis or the binding characteristics of ligands with Nsp13 by using MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA.

By analyzing sera obtained 6 months after the second shot in the primary vaccine series, the researchers found that neutralizing antibody titers persisted against all variants tested.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) predisposes males to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, while the use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis) and androgen receptor antagonists reduce COVID-19 disease severity. In this study, we aimed to determine the potential benefit of dutasteride, a commonly used broad and potent 5ARi, as a treatment for COVID-19. Design, setting, and participants The study was conducted at outpatient clinics. Subjects presented to the clinics with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test taken within 24 hours of recruitment. All subjects presented with mild to moderate symptoms. Interventions Subjects were given either dutasteride 0.5 mg/day or placebo for 30 days or until full COVID-19 remission.

Usual care included antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, vasopressor support, and anticoagulants.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPrimary outcomes were scores higher than 5 on the World Health Organization 10-point Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) on day 4 and survival without need of ventilation (including noninvasive ventilation) at day 14. Secondary outcomes were clinical status assessed with the WHO-CPS scores at day 7 and day 14, overall survival, time to discharge, time to oxygen supply independency, biological factors such as C-reactive protein level, and adverse events.\n\n\nResults\nOf 131 patients, 64 patients were randomly assigned to the TCZ group and 67 to UC group; 1 patient in the TCZ group withdrew consent and was not included in the analysis. Of the 130 patients, 42 were women (32%), and median (interquartile range) age was 64 (57.1-74.3) years. In the TCZ group, 12 patients had a WHO-CPS score greater than 5 at day 4 vs 19 in the UC group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] -9.0%; 90% credible interval [CrI], -21.0 to 3.1), with a posterior probability of negative ARD of 89.0% not achieving the 95% predefined efficacy threshold. At day 14, 12% (95% CI -28% to 4%) fewer patients needed noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (MV) or died in the TCZ group than in the UC group (24% vs 36%, median posterior hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 90% CrI, 0.33-1.00), with a posterior probability of HR less than 1 of 95.0%, achieving the predefined efficacy threshold. The HR for MV or death was 0.58 (90% CrI, 0.30 to 1.09). At day 28, 7 patients had died in the TCZ group and 8 in the UC group (adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.33-2.53). Serious adverse events occurred in 20 (32%) patients in the TCZ group and 29 (43%) in the UC group (P = .21).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this randomized clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia requiring oxygen support but not admitted to the intensive care unit, TCZ did not reduce WHO-CPS scores lower than 5 at day 4 but might have reduced the risk of NIV, MV, or death by day 14. No difference on day 28 mortality was found. Further studies are necessary for confirming these preliminary results.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04331808.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In this randomized clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia requiring oxygen support but not admitted to the intensive care unit, TCZ did not reduce WHO-CPS scores lower than 5 at day 4 but might have reduced the risk of NIV, MV, or death by day 14, and no difference on day 28 mortality was found."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":32,"details":{"paperId":"12f348683d810835699c6abeea41aeaa36f41595","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1001/jama.2020.26848","CorpusId":"231945226","PubMed":"33595634"},"title":"Effect of a Single High Dose of Vitamin D3 on Hospital Length of Stay in Patients With Moderate to Severe COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.","abstract":"Importance\nThe efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear.\n\n\nObjective\nTo investigate the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D3 on hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: An open-label randomized clinical trial study was performed in Tabriz, North-West of Iran. They were randomized to either the treatment with the bromhexine group or the control group, in a 1:1 ratio with 39 patients in each arm. Standard therapy was used in both groups and those patients in the treatment group received oral bromhexine 8 mg three times a day additionally. The primary outcome was a decrease in the rate of ICU admissions, intubation/mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Results: A total of 78 patients with similar demographic and disease characteristics were enrolled. There was a significant reduction in ICU admissions (2 out of 39 vs. 11 out of 39, P = 0.006), intubation (1 out of 39 vs. 9 out of 39, P = 0.007) and death (0 vs. 5, P = 0.027) in the bromhexine treated group compared to the standard group.

Our previous studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) virus‐like particles (VLPs) can be assembled using a recombinant baculovirus (rBV) expression system and such VLPs induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice after subcutaneous injection. Here, we investigated mucosal immune responses to SARS‐CoV VLPs in a mouse model. Mice were immunized in parallel, intraperitoneally or intranasally, with VLPs alone or with VLPs plus cytosine–phosphate–guanosine (CpG). Immune responses, including the production of SARS‐CoV‐specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), were determined in mucosal secretions and tissues. Both immunizations induced SARS‐CoV‐specific IgG, although the levels of IgG in groups immunized via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route were higher. sIgA was detected in saliva in groups immunized intranasally but not in groups immunized intraperitoneally. CpG had an adjuvant effect on IgA production in genital tract washes when administered intranasally but only affected IgA production in faeces samples when administered intraperitoneally. In addition, IgA was also detected in mucosal tissues from the lung and intestine, while CpG induced an increased level of IgA in the intestine. Most importantly, neutralization antibodies were detected in sera after i.p. and intranasal (i.n.) immunizations. Secretions in genital tract washes from the i.n. group also showed neutralization activity. Furthermore, VLPs that were administered intraperitoneally elicited cellular immune responses as demonstrated by enzyme‐linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay analyses.

In addition to its well-documented interaction with its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells.

Tocilizumab, as a recombinant humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, can bind to the IL-6 receptor with high affinity, thus preventing IL-6 itself from binding to its receptor, rendering it incapable of immune damage to target cells, and alleviating the inflammatory responses. After analyzing the immune characteristics of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes with large amount of interleukin 6 secreting may incite the inflammatory storm, which may potentially be curbed through monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways. Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19 and seek a therapeutic strategy.

Currently, numerous countries have been involved in the development of effective vaccines to protect humans against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present review will discuss the four vaccines, AZD1222 (AstraZeneca or Vaxzevria), Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S), Moderna/mRNA-1273 and BioNTech/Fosun/Pfizer BNT162b1, that are currently in use worldwide to understand their efficacy, but also evaluate the difficulties and challenges of vaccine development. Although several questions should be addressed regarding these vaccines, the current review will examine the viral elements used in the coronavirus-19 vaccine that can play a crucial role in inducing a strong immune response, as well as the different adverse effects that they can cause to individuals.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The current review will examine the viral elements used in the coronavirus-19 vaccine that can play a crucial role in inducing a strong immune response, as well as the different adverse effects that they can cause to individuals."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5255,"details":{"paperId":"db0a78e71c99ea8879da2fad653e35a8c11323c7","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7268172","MAG":"3029013662","DOI":"10.1186/s13063-020-04382-3","CorpusId":"219182573","PubMed":"32493468"},"title":"Effectiveness of Interferon Beta 1a, compared to Interferon Beta 1b and the usual therapeutic regimen to treat adults with moderate to severe COVID-19: structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Time to clinical improvement is the primary outcome measure and mortality from the date of randomization until the last day of the study which will be the day all of the patients have had at least one of the following outcomes: Improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5554,"details":{"paperId":"0cab4fe180bffe0b84d46aa55ff94cc3bc1a4324","externalIds":{"MAG":"3092176787","DOI":"10.18483/ijsci.2378","CorpusId":"226280977"},"title":"Effectiveness of Ivermectin in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Patients","abstract":"Background:The first case of Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were diagnosed in Wuhan, China in 2019.

However, no specific antiviral agents are available for its treatment. In this work, we explore the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients. The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was well tolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 d. Meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 d. Radiological examination showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19, while the randomized trial is warranted. Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia.

Objective: It was the aim of this study to characterize the effects of histamine receptor blockade in severe bacterial infections in more detail. Methods: To obtain information on the safety of histamine receptor blockade in more detail, we used pharmacological and genetic approaches targeting histamine receptors and performed cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a mouse model of septic peritonitis. After induction of septic peritonitis, morbidity and mortality were monitored closely. Results: Here, we show that oral treatment with first-generation H1R antihistamine diphenhydramine, H2R blocker cimetidine and H3/4R blocker thioperamide impairs optimal innate immune responses in severe murine bacterial sepsis. However, these adverse effects are not mediated by H1R, as mice deficient for H1R show similar rates of morbidity and mortality after CLP as their wild-type controls. Similarly, the second-generation antihistamine desloratadine neither affects morbidity nor mortality after CLP.

Although a large number of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been developed, it remains unclear if a single RBD-targeting nAb or two in combination can prevent neutralization escape and, if not, attenuate viral virulence in vivo. In this study, we used a large panel of human nAbs against an epitope that overlaps the interface between the RBD and its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to assess their cross-neutralization activities against a panel of human and zoonotic SARS-CoVs and neutralization escape mutants. We also investigated the neutralization escape profiles of these nAbs and evaluated their effects on receptor binding and virus fitness in vitro and in mice. We found that some nAbs had great potency and breadth in neutralizing multiple viral strains, including neutralization escape viruses derived from other nAbs; however, no single nAb or combination of two blocked neutralization escape. Interestingly, in mice the neutralization escape mutant viruses showed either attenuation (Urbani background) or increased virulence (GD03 background) consistent with the different binding affinities between their RBDs and the mouse ACE2. We conclude that using either single nAbs or dual nAb combinations to target a SARS-CoV RBD epitope that shows plasticity may have limitations for preventing neutralization escape during in vivo immunotherapy. However, RBD-directed nAbs may be useful for providing broad neutralization and prevention of escape variants when combined with other nAbs that target a second conserved epitope with less plasticity and more structural constraint. IMPORTANCE The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has resulted in severe human respiratory disease with high death rates. Their zoonotic origins highlight the likelihood of reemergence or further evolution into novel human coronavirus pathogens. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that prevent infection of related viruses represent an important immunostrategy for combating coronavirus infections; however, for this strategy to succeed, it is essential to uncover nAb-mediated escape pathways and to pioneer strategies that prevent escape. Here, we used SARS-CoV as a research model and examined the escape pathways of broad nAbs that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus. We found that neither single nAbs nor two nAbs in combination blocked escape. Our results suggest that targeting conserved regions with less plasticity and more structural constraint rather than the SARS-CoV RBD-like region(s) should have broader utility for antibody-based immunotherapy.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Broadly neutralizing antibodies that prevent infection of related viruses represent an important immunostrategy for combating coronavirus infections; however, for this strategy to succeed, it is essential to uncover nAb-mediated escape pathways and to pioneer strategies that prevent escape."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2027,"details":{"paperId":"00857872c82971271104a1a64c0e1cce5c912b41","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7112457","MAG":"1999639343","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14962-8","CorpusId":"23236479","PubMed":"14667748"},"title":"Effects of a SARS-associated coronavirus vaccine in monkeys","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results show that an adenoviral-based vaccine can induce strong SARS-CoV-specific immune responses in the monkey, and hold promise for development of a protective vaccine against the SARS causal agent."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1500,"details":{"paperId":"3cc19ab0730265040784a369c1f1bd7c4598ca58","externalIds":{"MAG":"1995121548","PubMedCentral":"7108318","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcv.2004.07.006","CorpusId":"41818212","PubMed":"15494274"},"title":"Effects of early corticosteroid treatment on plasma SARS-associated Coronavirus RNA concentrations in adult patients","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","ClinicalTrial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Findings suggested “early” corticosteroid treatment was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load in previously healthy SARS patients."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":85,"details":{"paperId":"1eb139f90f468e7354472de0f261ec34cda5b186","externalIds":{"MAG":"3091148819","PubMedCentral":"7527945","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6319","CorpusId":"222171598","PubMed":"33001138"},"title":"Efficacy and Safety of Hydroxychloroquine vs Placebo for Pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 Prophylaxis Among Health Care Workers","abstract":"Key Points Question Does a regimen of hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, per day, reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy when taken by hospital-based health care workers?

The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. Methods This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline.

Early reviews recommended the use of ivermectin based largely on non-peer-reviewed evidence, which may not be robust. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of ivermectin for treating COVID-19 based on peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OSs). Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were searched from 1 January 2020 to 1 September 2021 for relevant studies. Outcomes included time to viral clearance, duration of hospitalization, mortality, incidence of mechanical ventilation and incidence of adverse events. RoB2 and ROBINS-I were used to assess risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. GRADE was used to evaluate quality of evidence. Results Three OSs and 14 RCTs were included in the review. Most RCTs were rated as having some concerns in regards to risk of bias, while OSs were mainly rated as having a moderate risk of bias. Based on meta-analysis of RCTs, the use of ivermectin was not associated with reduction in time to viral clearance, duration of hospitalization, incidence of mortality and incidence of mechanical ventilation. Ivermectin did not significantly increase incidence of adverse events. Meta-analysis of OSs agrees with findings from RCT studies.

Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published through July 7, 2020. We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, preprints and grey literature. We included studies that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without AZ.

We use computational design, affinity maturation, and fusion to dimerization domains to engineer “receptor traps” based on wild-type angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), the target for viral spike-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. The optimized ACE2 receptor traps neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 infections as effectively as high-affinity antibodies isolated from convalescent patients and also bind viral spike proteins from other coronaviruses known to cause respiratory diseases. ACE2 receptor traps have large binding interfaces and block the entire receptor binding interface, limiting the potential impact of viral escape mutations. An essential mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection begins with the viral spike protein binding to the human receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2–RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest-affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human immunoglobulin crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2–pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the 10- to 100-ng/mL range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-using coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be predesigned for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent patients.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-using coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2510,"details":{"paperId":"49ff695cc9f8e58948f449309562915bce3a7695","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41422-020-00438-w","CorpusId":"256602212"},"title":"Engineered trimeric ACE2 binds viral spike protein and locks it in “Three-up” conformation to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3759,"details":{"paperId":"55623271de7030dbb7597d29ff91fd91a486c5f4","externalIds":{"MAG":"3018144375","PubMedCentral":"7263517","DOI":"10.1101/2020.04.21.053017","CorpusId":"216145273","PubMed":"32511388"},"title":"Enisamium is a small molecule inhibitor of the influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerases","abstract":"Influenza A virus and coronavirus strains cause a mild to severe respiratory disease that can result in death. Although vaccines exist against circulating influenza A viruses, such vaccines are ineffective against emerging pandemic influenza A viruses. Currently, no vaccine exists against coronavirus infections, including pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat these RNA virus infections, alternative antiviral strategies are needed. A key drug target is the viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for viral RNA synthesis. In January 2020, the World Health Organisation identified enisamium as a candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Enisamium is an isonicotinic acid derivative that is an inhibitor of multiple influenza B and A virus strains in cell culture and clinically approved in 11 countries. Here we show using in vitro assays that enisamium and its putative metabolite, VR17-04, inhibit the activity of the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. VR17-04 displays similar efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir triphosphate. These results suggest that enisamium is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of RNA virus RNA synthesis, and implicate it as a possible therapeutic option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike remdesivir, enisamium does not require intravenous administration which may be advantageous for the development of COVID-19 treatments outside a hospital setting. Importance Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 are respiratory viruses capable of causing pandemics, and the latter is responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Both viruses encode RNA polymerases which transcribe their RNA genomes and are important targets for antiviral drugs including remdesivir. Here, we show that the antiviral drug enisamium inhibits the RNA polymerases of both influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we show that a putative metabolite of enisamium is a more potent inhibitor, inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase with similar efficiency to remdesivir.

In the past two decades different parts of the word experienced smaller or bigger outbreak related to human coronaviruses. The spike glycoproteins of the COVID‐19 (similar to SARS‐CoV) attach to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE2) and transit over a stabilized open state for the viral internalization to the host cells and propagate with great efficacy. Higher rate of mutability makes this virus unpredictable/less sensitive to the protein/nucleic acid based drugs. In this emergent situation, drug‐induced destabilization of spike binding to RBD could be a good strategy. In the current study we demonstrated by bioinformatics (CASTp: computed atlas of surface topography of protein, PyMol: molecular visualization) and molecular docking (PatchDock and Autodock) experiments that tea flavonoids catechin products mainly epigallocatechin gallate or other like theaflavin gallate demonstrated higher atomic contact energy (ACE) value, binding energy, Ki value, ligand efficiency, surface area and more amino acid interactions than hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during binding in the central channel of the spike protein. Moreover, out of three distinct binding sites (I, II and III) of spike core when HCQ binds only with site III (farthest from the nCoV‐RBD of ACE2 contact), epigallocatechin gallate and theaflavin gallate bind all three sites.

There is a pressing need for serology tests to assess patient-specific antibody response and predict clinical outcome. METHODS Using SARS-CoV-2 proteome and peptide microarrays, we screened 146 COVID-19 patients’ plasma samples to identify antigens and epitopes. This enabled us to develop a master epitope array and an epitope-specific agglutination assay to gauge antibody responses systematically and with high resolution. RESULTS We identified linear epitopes from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and showed that the epitopes enabled higher resolution antibody profiling than the S or N protein antigen. Specifically, we found that antibody responses to the S-811–825, S-881–895, and N-156–170 epitopes negatively or positively correlated with clinical severity or patient survival. Moreover, we found that the P681H and S235F mutations associated with the coronavirus variant of concern B.1.1.7 altered the specificity of the corresponding epitopes. CONCLUSION Epitope-resolved antibody testing not only affords a high-resolution alternative to conventional immunoassays to delineate the complex humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and differentiate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, but it also may potentially be used to predict clinical outcome. The epitope peptides can be readily modified to detect antibodies against variants of concern in both the peptide array and latex agglutination formats.

To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing to investigate, diagnose and treat COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein in all tested applications including immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19. Moreover, as each mAb has a unique binding sequence, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins even if the virus acquires novel mutations.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study describes the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs that are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein and shows that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1965,"details":{"paperId":"bec5ff2efa6dfa5ada0e5b6276be852401b2c0c2","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4036818","MAG":"2014529290","DOI":"10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.015","CorpusId":"12947766","PubMed":"17397958"},"title":"Evaluating the 3C-like protease activity of SARS-Coronavirus: Recommendations for standardized assays for drug discovery","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated for the first time the utility of a highly sensitive and novel Alexa488-QSY7 FRET-based peptide substrate designed for routine analysis and high-throughput screening, and it is shown that kinetic constants determined from Fret-based assays that are uncorrected for inner-filter effects can lead to artifacts."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5257,"details":{"paperId":"186e7c3bcf7551517f1ca019bcfd200e903ad1be","externalIds":{"MAG":"3033485223","PubMedCentral":"7276974","DOI":"10.1186/s13063-020-04422-y","CorpusId":"219529411","PubMed":"32513308"},"title":"Evaluating the efficacy and safety of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in severely ill adults with COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement, which is defined as time from randomization to either discharge from the hospital or improvement by one point on the following seven-point ordinal scale, whichever occurs first."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3775,"details":{"paperId":"8c7d326e95c0950230fc7fe417856a9f50bb93ef","externalIds":{"MAG":"3021932384","DOI":"10.1101/2020.04.29.067983","CorpusId":"218530043"},"title":"Evaluation of 19 antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 Infection","abstract":"The global pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) has prompted multiple clinical trials to jumpstart search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies from existing drugs, including those with reported in vitro efficacies as well as those ones that are not known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, such as ritonavir/lopinavir and favilavir.

Objective and Methods: To estimate the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapeutics, we performed meta-analyses of the studies reporting clinical features and treatments of COVID-19 published from January 21 to September 6, 2020. Results: We included 136 studies that involved 102,345 COVID-19 patients. The most prevalent treatments were antibiotics (proportion: 0.59, 95% CI: [0.51, 0.67]) and antivirals (proportion: 0.52, 95% CI: [0.44, 0.60]). The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and Arbidol was the most effective in treating COVID-19 (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.68, 95% CI: [0.15, 1.21]). The use of corticosteroids was associated with a small clinical improvement (SMD = −0.40, 95% CI: [−0.85, −0.23]), but with a higher risk of disease progression and death (mortality: RR = 9.26, 95% CI: [4.81, 17.80]; hospitalization length: RR = 1.54, 95% CI: [1.39, 1.72]; severe adverse events: RR = 2.65, 95% CI: [2.09, 3.37]). The use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a higher risk of death (RR = 1.68, 95% CI: [1.18, 2.38]). The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon-β (RR = 0.34, 95% CI: [0.22, 0.54]); hydroxychloroquine (RR = 0.58, 95% CI: [0.39, 0.58]); and lopinavir/ritonavir (RR = 0.72, 95% CI: [0.56, 0.91]) was associated with reduced hospitalization length. Hydrocortisone (RR = 0.05, 95% CI: [0.03, 0.10]) and remdesivir (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: [0.62, 0.90]) were associated with lower incidence of severe adverse events.

Conclusion: Antivirals are safe and effective in COVID-19 treatment. Remdesivir cannot significantly reduce COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization length, while it is associated with a lower incidence of severe adverse events.

Furthermore, we discuss the advantages of peptidomimetics and other potential targets that have been studied using peptide-based therapeutics for COVID-19.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6145,"details":{"paperId":"81fee6fcac7370653d0e768380e95b66c67813ad","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7231123","MAG":"3013463190","DOI":"10.3390/nu12040988","CorpusId":"215406949","PubMed":"32252338"},"title":"Evidence that Vitamin D Supplementation Could Reduce Risk of Influenza and COVID-19 Infections and Deaths","abstract":"The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2219,"details":{"paperId":"331b84d2ea4e78707c7d2fced38ba0d74b70030a","externalIds":{"MAG":"3013150515","PubMedCentral":"7193144","DOI":"10.1016/s2665-9913(20)30089-8","CorpusId":"214758125","PubMed":"32368738"},"title":"Excitement around hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 causes challenges for rheumatology","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1210,"details":{"paperId":"927adedf7370eb92b30b922aab129f72274e32a9","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7185795","MAG":"3014351337","DOI":"10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007","CorpusId":"214758813","PubMed":"32346491"},"title":"Experimental Treatment with Favipiravir for COVID-19: An Open-Label Control Study","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2994,"details":{"paperId":"9d23370eacdba2cee9e617e49dfcd6a20a457e01","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7851407","DOI":"10.1042/CS20201511","CorpusId":"231679381","PubMed":"33479758"},"title":"Experimental data using candesartan and captopril indicate no double-edged sword effect in COVID-19","abstract":"Abstract The key link between renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and COVID-19 is ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which acts as a double-edged sword, because ACE2 increases the tissue anti-inflammatory response but it is also the entry receptor for the virus. There is an important controversy on several drugs that regulate RAS activity and possibly ACE2, and are widely used, particularly by patients most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. In the lung of healthy rats, we observed that candesartan (an angiotensin type-1, AT1, receptor blocker; ARB) and captopril (an ACE inhibitor; ACEI) up-regulated expression of tissue ACE2 and RAS anti-inflammatory axis receptors (AT2 and Mas receptors). This effect was particularly pronounced in rats with metabolic syndrome (obesity, increased blood pressure and hyperglycemia) and aged rats. Treatment of cultures of human type-II pneumocytes with candesartan or captopril induced up-regulation of ACE2 expression in cells. Treatment with viral spike protein induced a decrease in full-length (i.e. transmembrane) ACE2, an increase in levels of a short intracellular ACE2 polypeptide and an increase in ADAM17 activity in cells, together with an increase in levels of soluble ACE2 and major proinflammatory cytokines in the culture medium. Spike protein-induced changes and levels of spike protein internalization in cells were inhibited by pretreatment with the above-mentioned drugs. The results suggest that these drugs increase ACE2 levels and promote the anti-inflammatory RAS axis in the lung. Furthermore, possible up-regulation of viral entry by the drug-induced increase in expression of transmembrane ACE2 is counteracted by additional mechanisms, particularly by drug-induced inhibition of ADAM17 activity.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that these drugs increase ACE2 levels and promote the anti-inflammatory RAS axis in the lung, and possible up-regulation of viral entry by the drug-induced increase in expression of transmembrane ACE2 is counteracted by additional mechanisms."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3991,"details":{"paperId":"9e5bf34d9f119e78bd3e388b990cc8d2593d17d4","externalIds":{"MAG":"3063729662","DOI":"10.1101/2020.08.19.257493","CorpusId":"221276692"},"title":"Exploring G and C-quadruplex structures as potential targets against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","abstract":"In this paper we report the analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome and related viruses using an upgraded version of the open-source algorithm G4-iM Grinder.

These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally.

Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait the carboxy-terminal endodomain of S, which faces the cytosol during and after opening of the fusion pore at early stages of the virus life cycle. Here we show that the ezrin membrane-actin linker interacts with S endodomain through the F1 lobe of its FERM domain and that both the eight carboxy-terminal amino-acids and a membrane-proximal cysteine cluster of S endodomain are important for this interaction in vitro. Interestingly, we found that ezrin is present at the site of entry of S-pseudotyped lentiviral particles in Vero E6 cells. Targeting ezrin function by small interfering RNA increased S-mediated entry of pseudotyped particles in epithelial cells. Furthermore, deletion of the eight carboxy-terminal amino acids of S enhanced S-pseudotyped particles infection. Expression of the ezrin dominant negative FERM domain enhanced cell susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV and S-pseudotyped particles and potentiated S-dependent membrane fusion.

However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged shedding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce. Methods Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription PCR conversion at the No. 3 People's Hospital of Hubei province, China, between 31 January and 9 March 2020. We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. Results Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (interquartile range 18–32 days). Older age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00–1.05; p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10–5.36; p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days versus 28.5 days; log-rank p<0.001). Conclusion Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration. Risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding include older age and the lack of lopinavir/ritonavir treatment.

Famotidine is commonly used for gastric acid suppression but also has recently gained attention as an antiviral that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Objective: To determine whether famotidine use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 initially hospitalized to a non-intensive care setting. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Inpatients at a single academic medical center. Participants: Consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from February 25 to April 13, 2020.

Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anticancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, −13.8 kcal/mol. The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic. Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (−3.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (−7.9 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of −12.9 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor–ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor–ligand binding were identified. I found that one hot spot residue, His41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Small animal infection models, such as the hamster model, have a pivotal place herein. We here show in vivo preclinical results with favipiravir which indicate that antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 might only be achieved with a very high dose. Hydroxychloroquine, on the other hand, completely lacks antiviral activity, thus providing no scientific basis for its further use in COVID-19 patients. With this study on two key antiviral candidates, we establish the baseline for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral treatment, which will allow us to identify superior antiviral candidates in the near future. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread around the globe after its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019. With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus has infected millions of people of which more than half a million succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The urgent need for an effective treatment together with a lack of small animal infection models has led to clinical trials using repurposed drugs without preclinical evidence of their in vivo efficacy. We established an infection model in Syrian hamsters to evaluate the efficacy of small molecules on both infection and transmission. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2−infected hamsters with a low dose of favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine with(out) azithromycin resulted in, respectively, a mild or no reduction in virus levels. However, high doses of favipiravir significantly reduced infectious virus titers in the lungs and markedly improved lung histopathology. Moreover, a high dose of favipiravir decreased virus transmission by direct contact, whereas hydroxychloroquine failed as prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic modeling of hydroxychloroquine suggested that the total lung exposure to the drug did not cause the failure. Our data on hydroxychloroquine (together with previous reports in macaques and ferrets) thus provide no scientific basis for the use of this drug in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, the results with favipiravir demonstrate that an antiviral drug at nontoxic doses exhibits a marked protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 in a small animal model. Clinical studies are required to assess whether a similar antiviral effect is achievable in humans without toxic effects.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In vivo preclinical results with favipiravir indicate that antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 might only be achieved with a very high dose, whereas hydroxychloroquine, completely lacks antiviral activity, provides no scientific basis for its further use in COVID-19 patients and demonstrates that an antiviral drug at nontoxic doses exhibits a marked protective effect in a small animal model."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3830,"details":{"paperId":"c4b4f7220b82938c181907ff3feb35296dc63848","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7263509","MAG":"3025979430","DOI":"10.1101/2020.05.15.098731","CorpusId":"218686803","PubMed":"32511380"},"title":"Favipiravir strikes the SARS-CoV-2 at its Achilles heel, the RNA polymerase","abstract":"The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emphasized the urgent need for antiviral therapeutics.

Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2/first day followed by 600mg*2/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213).

Among these proteins, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), also named main protease, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), have been identified as fundamental targets due to its importance in the viral replication stages. OBJECTIVES To investigate, in silico, two of the most abundant flavonoid glycosides from Dysphania ambrosioides; a medicinal plant found in many regions of the world, along with some of the putative derivatives of these flavonoid glycosides in the human organism as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. METHODS Using a molecular docking approach, the interactions and the binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp were predicted for quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (nicotiflorin) and some of their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. FINDINGS Docking analysis, based on the crystal structure of 3CLpro and RdRp, indicated rutin, nicotiflorin, and their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives as potential inhibitors for both proteins. Also, the importance of the hydrogen bond and π-based interactions was evidenced for the presumed active sites.

No significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was found for several compounds reportedly active against SARS-CoV-2 such as lopinavir, nelfinavir, nitazoxanide, favipiravir, and hydroxychroloquine.

Here, we performed RNA structure probing to obtain single-base resolution secondary structure maps of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome both in vitro and in living infected cells. Probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5′ UTR and s2m), and reveal new structures. Of these, ∼10.2% show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role.

The outbreaks of Ebola viruses in 2014 represented the most serious Ebola epidemics in history and greatly threatened public health worldwide. The development of additional effective anti-Ebola therapeutic agents is therefore quite urgent. In this study, via high throughput screening of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, we identified that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, potently prevents the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, teicoplanin also has an inhibitory effect on transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles, with an IC50 as low as 330 nm. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that teicoplanin is able to block the entry of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) envelope pseudotyped viruses as well. Teicoplanin derivatives such as dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin can also inhibit the entry of Ebola, MERS, and SARS viruses. Mechanistic studies showed that teicoplanin blocks Ebola virus entry by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L, opening a novel avenue for the development of additional glycopeptides as potential inhibitors of cathepsin L-dependent viruses. Notably, given that teicoplanin has routinely been used in the clinic with low toxicity, our work provides a promising prospect for the prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola, MERS, and SARS virus infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work identified that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, potently prevents the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the cytoplasm via high throughput screening of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1117,"details":{"paperId":"292d8531ac73c3eb1eafd94940808d7bc017edf4","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7953444","DOI":"10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155496","CorpusId":"232210810","PubMed":"33773396"},"title":"Glycyrrhizin prevents SARS-CoV-2 S1 and Orf3a induced high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and inhibits viral replication","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The dual ability of Glycyrrhizin to concomitantly halt virus replication and dampen pro-inflammatory mediators might constitute a viable therapeutic option in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2022,"details":{"paperId":"1e3a472b0d7b6ab43e6aa89fae227570288bd398","externalIds":{"MAG":"2105037592","PubMedCentral":"7112442","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13615-X","CorpusId":"45800358","PubMed":"12814717"},"title":"Glycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice roots, and replication of SARS-associated coronavirus","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Of all the compounds assessed, glycyrrhizin was the most active in inhibiting replication of the SARS-associated virus and should be assessed for treatment of SARS."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1804,"details":{"paperId":"5c2fdcbe9e832c4652d1637f15c258edd06052a9","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7311916","MAG":"3036970257","DOI":"10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107618","CorpusId":"219983129","PubMed":"32592716"},"title":"Glycyrrhizin: An alternative drug for the treatment of COVID-19 infection and the associated respiratory syndrome?","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The membrane and cytoplasmic effects of GLR, coupled with its long-established medical use as a relatively safe drug, make GLR a good candidate to be tested against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, alone and in combination with other drugs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4188,"details":{"paperId":"936812820cfb39201619713e03acfa7fd2d61040","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7168429","MAG":"2982765016","DOI":"10.1111/1348-0421.12754","CorpusId":"207896109","PubMed":"31692019"},"title":"Gold nanoparticle‐adjuvanted S protein induces a strong antigen‐specific IgG response against severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus infection, but fails to induce protective antibodies and limit eosinophilic infiltration in lungs","abstract":"The spike (S) protein of coronavirus, which binds to cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion for cell entry, is a candidate vaccine target for blocking coronavirus infection.

We previously proposed that the cationically modified chitosan N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC) is a potent inhibitor of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). Next, we demonstrated the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the compound, as it inhibited all low-pathogenicity human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). Here, using in vitro and ex vivo models of human airway epithelia, we show that HTCC effectively blocks MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also confirmed the mechanism of action for these two viruses, showing that the polymer blocks the virus entry into the host cell by interaction with the S protein.

For an effective immune prophylaxis in humans, broad coverage of different strains of SARS-CoV and control of potential neutralization escape variants will be required. Combinations of virus-neutralizing, noncompeting mAbs may have these properties. Methods and Findings Human mAb CR3014 has been shown to completely prevent lung pathology and abolish pharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV in infected ferrets. We generated in vitro SARS-CoV variants escaping neutralization by CR3014, which all had a single P462L mutation in the glycoprotein spike (S) of the escape virus. In vitro experiments confirmed that binding of CR3014 to a recombinant S fragment (amino acid residues 318–510) harboring this mutation was abolished. We therefore screened an antibody-phage library derived from blood of a convalescent SARS patient for antibodies complementary to CR3014. A novel mAb, CR3022, was identified that neutralized CR3014 escape viruses, did not compete with CR3014 for binding to recombinant S1 fragments, and bound to S1 fragments derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like strain SZ3. No escape variants could be generated with CR3022. The mixture of both mAbs showed neutralization of SARS-CoV in a synergistic fashion by recognizing different epitopes on the receptor-binding domain. Dose reduction indices of 4.5 and 20.5 were observed for CR3014 and CR3022, respectively, at 100% neutralization. Because enhancement of SARS-CoV infection by subneutralizing antibody concentrations is of concern, we show here that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies do not convert the abortive infection of primary human macrophages by SARS-CoV into a productive one. Conclusions The combination of two noncompeting human mAbs CR3014 and CR3022 potentially controls immune escape and extends the breadth of protection. At the same time, synergy between CR3014 and CR3022 may allow for a lower total antibody dose to be administered for passive immune prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown here that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies do not convert the abortive infection of primary human macrophages by SARS- coV into a productive one."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":464,"details":{"paperId":"d90f3e4ffcd2fd84e6ca8e426b3c49fa1844c7ee","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8097256","DOI":"10.1007/s00726-021-02991-z","CorpusId":"233741280","PubMed":"33950300"},"title":"Human cell receptors: potential drug targets to combat COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Overall, this review focuses on the critical role of human cell receptors involved in coronavirus pathogenesis, which would likely be used in designing target-specific drugs to combat COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2533,"details":{"paperId":"7a2fd5d17d5b755dfaf9ef39423db3dcf2bb147e","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41423-020-0426-7","CorpusId":"256612294"},"title":"Human monoclonal antibodies block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1950,"details":{"paperId":"517171ae5b964bf16070f287ae2f8299f70da1d0","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7111986","MAG":"1997505944","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2009.07.028","CorpusId":"27476983","PubMed":"19748648"},"title":"Human monoclonal antibodies to SARS-coronavirus inhibit infection by different mechanisms","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that a mixture containing antibodies recognizing distinct regions and targeting more than one step in viral entry is likely to be more effective in neutralizing the virus and suppressing the generation of escape mutants, and thus potentially constitute a highly effective passive immunotherapy."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2030,"details":{"paperId":"0914575ca88214b9ab39763352d03599f1568079","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7112500","MAG":"2098695079","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16506-9","CorpusId":"45758197","PubMed":"15220038"},"title":"Human monoclonal antibody as prophylaxis for SARS coronavirus infection in ferrets","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data generated in this animal model show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody might offer a feasible and effective prophylaxis for the control of human SARS coronavirus infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":929,"details":{"paperId":"3c4c83bac41da84c77416f4a24791e6def038061","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7879018","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.026","CorpusId":"231884798","PubMed":"33691139"},"title":"Human neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 require intact Fc effector functions for optimal therapeutic protection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2739,"details":{"paperId":"e68c93d2d749a5133a83f2a4995ca3365568b790","externalIds":{"MAG":"3029682964","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2380-z","CorpusId":"218907420","PubMed":"32454513"},"title":"Human neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In a study of antibodies isolated from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, antibodies that potently neutralized the virus competed with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for binding to the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein, suggesting that antibodies that disrupt this interaction could be developed to treat Sars-Cov-2 infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3733,"details":{"paperId":"5a3396c6e07a333da848102ff21155472a64347d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3105070128","DOI":"10.1101/2020.04.13.039917","CorpusId":"221289240"},"title":"Human organ chip-enabled pipeline to rapidly repurpose therapeutics during viral pandemics","abstract":"The rising threat of pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, requires development of new preclinical discovery platforms that can more rapidly identify therapeutics that are active in vitro and also translate in vivo.

However, the variation of the S gene between viruses may affect the efficacy of a vaccine, particularly for cross-protection against SARS-like CoV (SL-CoV). Recently, a more conserved group-specific open reading frame (ORF), the 3a gene, was found in both SARS-CoV and SL-CoV. Here, we studied the immunogenicity of human SARS-CoV 3a and bat SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines in mice through electroporation immunization followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent, enzyme-linked immunospot, and flow cytometry assays. Our results showed that high levels of specific humoral responses were induced by SARS-CoV 3a and SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccines. Furthermore, a strong Th1-based cellular immune response was stimulated by both DNA vaccines. The vaccines stimulated gamma interferon production mainly by CD8+ T cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) mainly by CD4+ T cells. Of interest, the frequency of IL-2-positive cells elicited by the SARS-CoV 3a DNA vaccine was significantly higher than that elicited by the SL-CoV 3a DNA vaccine.

Participants 150 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 were assigned to SOC alone (control group). Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was the 28-day negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2. The assessed secondary endpoints were negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21, the improvement rate of clinical symptoms within 28-day, normalization of C-reactive protein and blood lymphocyte count within 28-day. Primary and secondary analysis was by intention to treat. Adverse events were assessed in the safety population. Results The overall 28-day negative conversion rate was not different between SOC plus HCQ and SOC group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 85.4% versus 81.3%, P=0.341). Negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21 was also similar between the two groups. No different 28-day symptoms alleviation rate was observed between the two groups. A significant efficacy of HCQ on alleviating symptoms was observed when the confounding effects of anti-viral agents were removed in the post-hoc analysis (Hazard ratio, 8.83, 95%CI, 1.09 to 71.3). This was further supported by a significantly greater reduction of CRP (6.986 in SOC plus HCQ versus 2.723 in SOC, milligram/liter, P=0.045) conferred by the addition of HCQ, which also led to more rapid recovery of lymphopenia, albeit no statistical significance. Adverse events were found in 8.8% of SOC and 30% of HCQ recipients with two serious adverse events. The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea (10%). Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a higher negative conversion rate but more alleviation of clinical symptoms than SOC alone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without receiving antiviral treatment, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects.

Areas covered The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) initially garnered widespread attention following the publication of preliminary results showing that this drug exerts an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. Expert opinion To date, clinical evidence suggests lack of benefit from HCQ use for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In such patients, HCQ also appears to be associated with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, FDA has recently revoked the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of HCQ and chloroquine to treat COVID-19. Conversely, whether HCQ use may represent an effective prophylactic strategy against COVID-19 is a separate question that still remains to be answered.

However, human clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine failed to establish its usefulness as treatment for COVID-19. This compound is known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary to the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, cathepsin L can cleave the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins, thereby activating membrane fusion for cell entry. The plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 can similarly cleave these S proteins and activate viral entry at the cell surface. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 entry process is more dependent than that of SARS-CoV-1 on TMPRSS2 expression. This difference can be reversed when the furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ablated. We also show that hydroxychloroquine efficiently blocks viral entry mediated by cathepsin L, but not by TMPRSS2, and that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically-tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection more potently than either drug alone. These studies identify functional differences between SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry processes, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited in vivo utility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. Author Summary The novel pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and remains a threat to global public health. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to prevent viral infection in cell-culture systems, but human clinical trials did not observe a significant improvement in COVID-19 patients treated with these compounds. Here we show that hydroxychloroquine interferes with only one of two somewhat redundant pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is activated to mediate infection. The first pathway is dependent on the endosomal protease cathepsin L and sensitive to hydroxychloroquine, whereas the second pathway is dependent on TMPRSS2, which is unaffected by this compound. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 is more reliant than SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) on the TMPRSS2 pathway, and that this difference is due to a furin cleavage site present in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Finally, we show that combinations of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor work together to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry. Thus TMPRSS2 expression on physiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 target cells may bypass the antiviral activities of hydroxychloroquine, and explain its lack of in vivo efficacy.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that hydroxychloroquine interferes with only one of two somewhat redundant pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is activated to mediate infection, and that the first pathway is dependent on the endosomal protease cathepsin L and sensitive to hydroxy chloroquine, whereas the second pathway isdependent on TMPRSS2, which is unaffected by this compound."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1447,"details":{"paperId":"f568bd483d5d51fdae6a46a458be3a381999918c","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7406234","MAG":"3047103954","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacep.2020.07.016","CorpusId":"220975307","PubMed":"33478708"},"title":"Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin Therapy and QT Prolongation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An increase in corrected QT (QTc) prolongation was seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with combination HCQ/AZM and was not associated with death over the short period of the study in a population where mortality was already high."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3984,"details":{"paperId":"65ba6614b2177a9fb64c453ccfb620ae7f3fa1ca","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7430563","MAG":"3049585594","DOI":"10.1101/2020.08.13.250217","CorpusId":"221141089","PubMed":"32817933"},"title":"Hydroxychloroquine: mechanism of action inhibiting SARS-CoV2 entry.","abstract":"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed in the treatment of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, albeit with much controversy. In vitro, HCQ effectively inhibits viral entry, but its use in the clinic has been hampered by conflicting results. A better understanding of HCQ’s mechanism of actions in vitro is needed to resolve these conflicts. Recently, anesthetics were shown to disrupt ordered monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts. These same lipid rafts recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point, away from phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) domains. Here we employed super resolution imaging of cultured mammalian cells to show HCQ directly perturbs GM1 lipid rafts and inhibits the ability of ACE2 receptor to associate with the endocytic pathway. HCQ also disrupts PIP2 domains and their ability to cluster and sequester ACE2. Similarly, the antibiotic erythromycin inhibits viral entry and both HCQ and erythromycin decrease the antimicrobial host defense peptide amyloid beta in cultured cells. We conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to anesthetics. The disruption likely decreases viral clustering at both endocytic and putative PIP2 entry points. KEY POINTS Question: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine? Findings: Hydroxychloroquine disrupt lipid rafts similar to general anesthetics.

The presentation of the disease ranges from asymptomatic manifestations through to acute respiratory distress syndrome with the necessity of mechanical ventilation. Cytokine storm and maladaptive responses to the viral spread in the body could be responsible for the severity of disease. Many patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI) during the course of their disease, especially in more severe cases. Many factors could cause kidney damage during infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is still unclear whether direct viral damage or the overexpression of cytokines and inflammatory factors are preeminent. According to autoptic studies, in most of the cases, AKI is due proximal tubular damage. However, cases of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were reported as well in the absence of signs of direct viral infection of the kidney. Considering that severe hypoxia is a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the involvement of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system is very likely, possibly influencing the inflammatory response and outcome in both the lungs and kidneys. Several bodies of evidence have shown a possible role of the HIF pathway during AKI in various kidney disease models. Similar observations were made in the setting of acute lung injury. In both organs, HIF activation by means of inhibition of the prolyl-hydroxylases domain (PHD) could be protective.

Only a few coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two cause infections similar in severity to SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, a species closely related to SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, which emerged in 2012. Unlike the current pandemic, previous epidemics were controlled rapidly through public health measures, but the body of research investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome has proven valuable for identifying approaches to treating and preventing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Building on this research, the medical and scientific communities have responded rapidly to the COVID-19 crisis and identified many candidate therapeutics. The approaches used to identify candidates fall into four main categories: adaptation of clinical approaches to diseases with related pathologies, adaptation based on virological properties, adaptation based on host response, and data-driven identification (ID) of candidates based on physical properties or on pharmacological compendia. To date, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while most remain under investigation. The scale of the COVID-19 crisis offers a rare opportunity to collect data on the effects of candidate therapeutics. This information provides insight not only into the management of coronavirus diseases but also into the relative success of different approaches to identifying candidate therapeutics against an emerging disease. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving crisis. With the worldwide scientific community shifting focus onto the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19, a large number of possible pharmaceutical approaches for treatment and prevention have been proposed. What was known about each of these potential interventions evolved rapidly throughout 2020 and 2021. This fast-paced area of research provides important insight into how the ongoing pandemic can be managed and also demonstrates the power of interdisciplinary collaboration to rapidly understand a virus and match its characteristics with existing or novel pharmaceuticals. As illustrated by the continued threat of viral epidemics during the current millennium, a rapid and strategic response to emerging viral threats can save lives. In this review, we explore how different modes of identifying candidate therapeutics have borne out during COVID-19.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"How different modes of identifying candidate therapeutics have borne out during the COVID-19 pandemic is explored, providing important insight into how the ongoing pandemic can be managed and also demonstrates the power of interdisciplinary collaboration to rapidly understand a virus and match its characteristics with existing or novel pharmaceuticals."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2334,"details":{"paperId":"f3d9d9a929acad1e535ab07b7d64a7763acb14c9","externalIds":{"MAG":"3094560806","PubMedCentral":"7605328","DOI":"10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00521","CorpusId":"226238038","PubMed":"33324471"},"title":"Identification of 14 Known Drugs as Inhibitors of the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"A consensus virtual screening protocol has been applied to ca. 2000 approved drugs to seek inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. 42 drugs emerged as top candidates, and after visual analyses of the predicted structures of their complexes with Mpro, 17 were chosen for evaluation in a kinetic assay for Mpro inhibition.

Ongoing efforts to control the pandemic include the development of peptide-based vaccines and diagnostic tests. In these approaches, HLA allelic diversity plays a crucial role. Despite its importance, current knowledge of HLA allele frequencies in South America is very limited. In this study, we have performed a literature review of datasets reporting HLA frequencies of South American populations, available in scientific literature and/or in the Allele Frequency Net Database. This allowed us to enrich the current scenario with more than 12.8 million data points. As a result, we are presenting updated HLA allelic frequencies based on country, including 91 alleles that were previously thought to have frequencies either under 5% or of an unknown value. Using alleles with an updated frequency of at least ≥5% in any South American country, we predicted epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins using NetMHCpan (I and II) and MHC flurry. Then, the best predicted epitopes (class-I and -II) were selected based on their binding to South American alleles (Coverage Score). Class II predicted epitopes were also filtered based on their three-dimensional exposure. We obtained 14 class-I and four class-II candidate epitopes with experimental evidence (reported in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource), having good coverage scores for South America. Additionally, we are presenting 13 HLA-I and 30 HLA-II novel candidate epitopes without experimental evidence, including 16 class-II candidates in highly exposed conserved areas of the NTD and RBD regions of the Spike protein. These novel candidates have even better coverage scores for South America than those with experimental evidence. Finally, we show that recent similar studies presenting candidate epitopes also predicted some of our candidates but discarded them in the selection process, resulting in candidates with suboptimal coverage for South America. In conclusion, the candidate epitopes presented provide valuable information for the development of epitope-based strategies against SARS-CoV-2, such as peptide vaccines and diagnostic tests. Additionally, the updated HLA allelic frequencies provide a better representation of South America and may impact different immunogenetic studies.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6036,"details":{"paperId":"38dbada2b8357057bb47efae51f1f18ed06b8d4d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3089018088","PubMedCentral":"7601472","DOI":"10.3390/brainsci10100666","CorpusId":"222159291","PubMed":"32992681"},"title":"Identification of Novel Hypothalamic MicroRNAs as Promising Therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 by Regulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Expression: An In Silico Analysis","abstract":"Background: Neuroinvasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is well documented and, given the similarities between this virus and SARS-CoV-2, it seems that the neurological impairment that is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is due to SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion.

We were able to identify 311 host genes to be potentially targetable by 2,197 human miRNAs. These miRNAs are known to be involved in various biological processes, such as T-cell differentiation and activation, virus replication, and immune system.

Spike (S) protein is a major structural glycoprotein of the SARS virus and a potential target for SARS-specific cell-mediated immune responses. A panel of S protein–derived peptides was tested for their binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules. Peptides with high affinity for HLA-A*0201 were then assessed for their capacity to elicit specific immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) both in vivo, in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice, and in vitro, from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) sourced from healthy HLA-A2.1+ donors. SARS-CoV protein-derived peptide-1 (SSp-1 RLNEVAKNL), induced peptide-specific CTLs both in vivo (transgenic mice) and in vitro (human PBLs), which specifically released interferon-γ (IFN-γ) upon stimulation with SSp-1–pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs) or T2 cells.

The functional importance of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) in viral replication and maturation turns it into an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. At present, there is no standard drug regime nor any vaccine available against the infection. The rapid development and identification of efficient interventions against SARS-CoV-2 remains a major challenge. Based on the available knowledge of closely related coronavirus and their safety profiles, repurposing of existing antiviral drugs and screening of available databases is considered a near term strategic and economic way to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Herein, we applied computational drug design methods to identify Chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors from FDA approved antiviral drugs and our in-house database of natural and drug-like compounds of synthetic origin. As a result three FDA approved drugs (Remdesivir, Saquinavir and Darunavir) and two natural compounds (. flavone and coumarine derivatives) were identified as promising hits. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations were performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior, stability of protein-ligand contact, and binding affinity of the hit compounds. Our results indicate that the identified compounds can inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of Coronavirus. Considering the severity of the spread of coronavirus, the current study is in-line with the concept of finding the new inhibitors against the vital pathway of the corona virus to expedite the process of drug discovery.

Toward this objective, we conducted a large population study in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel, insuring over 4.7 million members. Methods: Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess which medications, acquired in the last month, decreased the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Case patients were adults aged 18 to 95 hospitalized for COVID-19. In the first cohort, five control patients, from the general population, were matched to each case (n=6202); in the second cohort, two non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive control patients were matched to each case (n=6919). The outcome measures for a medication were: odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization, 95% confidence interval (CI), and the p-value, using Fisher’s exact test. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing. Results: Medications associated with most significantly reduced odds for COVID-19 hospitalization include: ubiquinone (OR=0.185, 95% CI [0.058 to 0.458], p<0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.488, 95% CI [0.377 to 0.622], p<0.001), rosuvastatin (OR=0.673, 95% CI [0.596 to 0.758], p<0.001), flecainide (OR=0.301, 95% CI [0.118 to 0.641], p<0.001), and vitamin D (OR=0.869, 95% CI [0.792 to 0.954], p<0.003). Remarkably, acquisition of artificial tears, eye care wipes, and several ophthalmological products were also associated with decreased risk for hospitalization. Conclusions: Ubiquinone, ezetimibe, and rosuvastatin, all related to the cholesterol synthesis pathway were associated with reduced hospitalization risk.

The novel coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) play a crucial role during the disease propagation, and hence SARS-CoV-2 Mpro represents as a drug target for the drug discovery. Herein, we have applied bioinformatics approach for screening of chemical compounds from Indian spices as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDBID: 6Y84).

Here, we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively. The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained attenuated in mice. In contrast, during SARS-CoV-∆E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype. When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively. Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-∆E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence. These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a transmembrane protein to compensate for removal of this motif from the E protein. To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in E gene that did not affect the endogenous PBM, preventing the incorporation of novel chimeric proteins in the virus genome. In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations into the nsp1 protein. Deletions in the carboxy-terminal region of nsp1 protein led to higher host interferon responses and virus attenuation. Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in E and nsp1 genes maintained their attenuation after passage in vitro and in vivo. Further, these viruses fully protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against SARS-CoV.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in E and nsp1 genes maintained their attenuation after passage in vitro and in vivo and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against SARS-CoV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":835,"details":{"paperId":"9c09a3a104dc15eb175cc130a17a7304ceb7ec8c","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7079562","MAG":"2387037862","DOI":"10.1016/j.bmc.2016.05.013","CorpusId":"32716906","PubMed":"27240464"},"title":"Identification, synthesis and evaluation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Interestingly, 3f, 3g and 3m could inhibit both NA and 3CLpro and serve as a starting point to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4698,"details":{"paperId":"f5ee1d89b6ccc2734639ce9cabcad030d8bf3fc7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2171573919","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.01138-06","CorpusId":"19988120","PubMed":"17041212"},"title":"Identifying Epitopes Responsible for Neutralizing Antibody and DC-SIGN Binding on the Spike Glycoprotein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","abstract":"ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) uses dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) to facilitate cell entry via cellular receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

Corbett et al. studied nonhuman primate (NHP) immune responses to various doses of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine to provide a range of immune responses and protective outcomes. They determined that circulating spike protein–specific antibodies correlated with protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in the airways. Passively transferred NHP antibodies were sufficient to mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters, emphasizing that antibodies are mechanistic correlates. Protection of the lower respiratory tract required lower serum antibody concentrations, possibly explaining why most current vaccines are highly effective against severe lower airway disease. The higher antibody threshold required for reducing upper airway infection has potential implications for boosting to limit transmission. —STS mRNA-1273 vaccine–induced antibody responses are a mechanistic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primates. INTRODUCTION Mass vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) offers the most efficient public health intervention to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Two mRNA-based vaccines, Moderna’s mRNA-1273 and Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2, both of which encode the prefusion-stabilized spike glycoprotein S-2P, showed >94% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in interim phase 3 analyses and are currently being administered globally. Several other vaccines have shown 60 to 80% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in phase 3 trials, and a number of candidate vaccines are in earlier stages of clinical development. An immune correlate of protection can be used to inform potential dose reduction, advance approval of other vaccine candidates in lieu of phase 3 efficacy data, extend indications for use to other age groups, and provide insights into the immune mechanisms of protection. RATIONALE In assessing immunogenicity and protection of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been a useful model for clinical translation. NHP innate immune responses and B and T cell repertoires show much greater similarity to humans than do those of rodents, allowing immune responses to be assessed using clinically applicable vaccine doses and regimens. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, NHPs have transient viral replication in the upper and lower airways and mild inflammation in the lung that recapitulates the features of mild infection in humans. Here, we used immunogenicity and protection assessments from a previous NHP mRNA-1273 vaccine study combined with new data from a dose de-escalation study. We evaluated how multiple measurements of humoral and cellular immunity correlate with the reduction of viral replication in the upper and lower airway after challenge. Antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and nasal swabs (NS) after vaccination were analyzed to assess site-specific immune correlates. Finally, immunoglobulin G (IgG) from mRNA-immunized NHPs was passively transferred in a highly pathogenic Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 challenge model to determine whether these antibodies were sufficient for protection. RESULTS NHPs received either no vaccine or doses ranging from 0.3 to 100 μg of mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine encoding S-2P, at weeks 0 and 4. mRNA-1273 vaccination elicited circulating and mucosal antibody responses in a dose-dependent manner. Using the World Health Organization standard for measuring S-specific IgG, a 10-fold increase in S-binding titers was associated with ~10-fold reductions in viral replication in BAL and NS after challenge. No animal with S-specific IgG >336 IU/ml had BAL subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) >10,000 copies/ml, and no animal with S-specific IgG >645 IU/ml had NS sgRNA >100,000 copies/swab, so these were chosen as the thresholds for protection. These reductions in viral replication in BAL were associated with limited inflammation and viral antigen detection in lung tissue. Finally, passive transfer of vaccine-induced IgG from NHPs to naïve hamsters was sufficient to mediate protection. CONCLUSION mRNA-1273 vaccine–induced antibody responses are a mechanistic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHPs. Protection in the lower respiratory tract was achieved at lower serum antibody concentrations than in the upper respiratory tract. These data explain in part the consistent finding that vaccine efficacy against severe lower tract disease is greater than that against mild upper tract disease. These findings have potential implications for how additional boosting may sustain protection against severe disease in the lower respiratory tract and limit mild infection and transmission by enhancing the immunity required in the upper respiratory tract. mRNA-1273 vaccine–induced humoral immune responses are a mechanistic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2. Levels of serum and mucosal spike-specific IgG in mRNA-1273–vaccinated NHPs were inversely correlated with the reduction of viral replication in the upper airway and lower airway after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Immune correlates of protection can be used as surrogate endpoints for vaccine efficacy. Here, nonhuman primates (NHPs) received either no vaccine or doses ranging from 0.3 to 100 μg of the mRNA-1273 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. mRNA-1273 vaccination elicited circulating and mucosal antibody responses in a dose-dependent manner. Viral replication was significantly reduced in bronchoalveolar lavages and nasal swabs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vaccinated animals and most strongly correlated with levels of anti–S antibody and neutralizing activity. Lower antibody levels were needed for reduction of viral replication in the lower airway than in the upper airway. Passive transfer of mRNA-1273–induced immunoglobulin G to naïve hamsters was sufficient to mediate protection. Thus, mRNA-1273 vaccine–induced humoral immune responses are a mechanistic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in NHPs.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Assessing immunogenicity and protection of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, nonhuman primates have been a useful model for clinical translation and can be used to inform potential dose reduction, advance approval of other vaccine candidates in lieu of phase 3 efficacy data, extend indications for use to other age groups, and provide insights into the immune mechanisms of protection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5342,"details":{"paperId":"b638d404a28a56d5553e84bea7450712f5cf00ba","externalIds":{"MAG":"3009582878","DOI":"10.12932/AP-200220-0772","CorpusId":"211535628","PubMed":"32105090"},"title":"Immune responses in COVID-19 and potential vaccines: Lessons learned from SARS and MERS epidemic.","abstract":"As the world is witnessing the epidemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerging genetics and clinical evidences suggest a similar path to those of SARS and MERS.

Evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease. Design Four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of SARS, a VLP vaccine, the vaccine given to ferrets and NHP, another whole virus vaccine and an rDNA-produced S protein. Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated IM on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56. On day 58, challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology. Results All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses. Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV. All mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated (Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infection occurred in all. Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines was uniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmed with special eosinophil stains. The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence. Conclusions These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV.

Evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection in vitro and in non-human primates clouds the prospects for a safe vaccine. Using antibodies from SARS patients, we identified and characterized SARS-CoV B-cell peptide epitopes with disparate functions. In rhesus macaques, the spike glycoprotein peptides S471–503, S604–625, and S1164–1191 elicited antibodies that efficiently prevented infection in non-human primates. In contrast, peptide S597–603 induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates by using an epitope sequence-dependent (ESD) mechanism. This peptide exhibited a high level of serological reactivity (64%), which resulted from the additive responses of two tandem epitopes (S597–603 and S604–625) and a long-term human B-cell memory response with antisera from convalescent SARS patients. Thus, peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV could be engineered to avoid ADE via elimination of the S597–603 epitope.

It is currently unknown whether immunosuppressive drugs are advantageous or detrimental in patients with COVID-19. Immunosuppressive drugs could be harmful in the initial phase of COVID-19. In this phase, the host immune response is necessary to inhibit viral replication. However, immunosuppressive drugs might have a beneficial effect in the later, more severe phase of COVID-19. In this phase, an overshoot of the host immune response (the “cytokine storm”) can cause ARDS, multiorgan failure and mortality. Aim To summarize the available evidence on the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on infection with SARS-CoV-2. The effects of immunosuppressive drugs on similar pandemic coronaviruses may resemble the effects on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we also included studies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Methods The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020181137). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies with a control group and case-control studies concerning humans ≥ 18 years old. We also included in-vitro studies and animal studies with a control group. Results and Conclusion Sixty-nine studies were included. Interestingly, MPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vitro. Clinical studies are needed to confirm the inhibitory effect of MPA on SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vivo. There are indications that corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, like tocilizumab, can reduce mortality and prevent mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19. However, observational studies have contradictory results and the risk of bias is high. Thus, these results have to be confirmed in high-quality clinical trials before these drugs can be implemented as standard care. Based on the positive results of CNIs, mTOR inhibitors and thiopurine analogues in in-vitro studies with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it would be interesting to investigate their effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Interestingly, MPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vitro, and clinical studies are needed to confirm the inhibitory effect of MPA on Sars-Cov-2 replicate in- vivo."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3205,"details":{"paperId":"d43cf668377009e0d03bf4e1cc503bf96a483b0e","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7441764","MAG":"3047807411","DOI":"10.1080/14712598.2020.1807933","CorpusId":"221077160","PubMed":"32762581"},"title":"Immunotherapy for SARS-CoV-2: potential opportunities","abstract":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus, called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China...","publicationTypes":["Editorial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus, called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronav virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2986,"details":{"paperId":"6565108758bbcb93afc60260f4388e9d075e65b7","externalIds":{"MAG":"3047497883","PubMedCentral":"7601349","DOI":"10.1042/BSR20202856","CorpusId":"222819789","PubMed":"33063092"},"title":"Immunotherapy of COVID-19 with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors: starting with nicotinamide","abstract":"Abstract COVID-19 induces a proinflammatory environment that is stronger in patients requiring intensive care. The cytokine components of this environment may determine efficacy or otherwise of glucocorticoid therapy. The immunity modulators, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the nuclear NAD+-consuming enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP 1) may play a critical role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. The AhR is overexpressed in coronaviruses, including COVID-19 and, as it regulates PARP gene expression, the latter is likely to be activated in COVID-19. PARP 1 activation leads to cell death mainly by depletion of NAD+ and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), especially when availability of these energy mediators is compromised. PARP expression is enhanced in other lung conditions: the pneumovirus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). I propose that PARP 1 activation is the terminal point in a sequence of events culminating in patient mortality and should be the focus of COVID-19 immunotherapy. Potent PARP 1 inhibitors are undergoing trials in cancer, but a readily available inhibitor, nicotinamide (NAM), which possesses a highly desirable biochemical and activity profile, merits exploration. It conserves NAD+ and prevents ATP depletion by PARP 1 and Sirtuin 1 (silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1) inhibition, enhances NAD+ synthesis, and hence that of NADP+ which is a stronger PARP inhibitor, reverses lung injury caused by ischaemia/reperfusion, inhibits proinflammatory cytokines and is effective against HIV infection.

RESULTS: Of 878 patients in the analysis, 83 (9.5%) received famotidine. In comparison to patients not treated with famotidine, patients treated with famotidine were younger (63.5 ± 15.0 vs 67.5 ± 15.8 years, P = 0.021), but did not differ with respect to baseline demographics or preexisting comorbidities.

Hence, there is an urgency to find effective treatment. Of those patients afflicted in the United States, many have required treatment with ventilator secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data are needed regarding the benefit of treatment and prevention of the cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients with Tocilizumab. Methods: Clinical outcomes data for patients admitted to Orange Regional Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 from Mar 15, 2020 to Apr 20, 2020 were identified through electronic health record chart review. We conducted a retrospective case-control study in confirmed COVID 19 positive patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and compared outcome in terms of mortality and length of stay amongst those who received Tocilizumab as treatment modality opposed to those that did not. Results: A total of 94 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were analyzed. 44 were in the study group and 50 in the control group. We tried to match both group as close as possible in terms of age, sex, BMI and HS score- calculated using inflammatory markers- ferritin, triglycerides, AST and fibrinogen. The median age was 55.5 years in the study group and 66 in the control group, difference was not statistically significant. Average HS score was 114 in the Tocilizumab group and 92 in the control group, difference was statistically significant with P<0.0001. Also, the patients in the study group had elevated levels of IL-6, triglycerides, AST, ferritin which were statistically significant with p < 0.0001 when compared to the control group. Length of stay was longer, average 17.9 days in the Tocilizumab. Survival rate was much lower at 48 % in the control group and 61.36 % in patients who received Tocilizumab with significant P value of < 0.00001. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 7.48, if we treat 8 patients with Tocilizumab, 1 will not die. Conclusions: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) occurs in a large number of patients with severe COVID-19, which is also an important cause of death. IL- 6 is the key molecule of CRS, so IL-6R antagonist Tocilizumab may be of value in improving outcomes. In our study Tocilizumab group seemed to have improved survival outcome.

ABSTRACT The membrane-anchored spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a pivotal role in directing the fusion of the virus particle mediated by the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). The fusion peptide region of the S protein S2 domain provides SARS-CoV-2 with the biological machinery needed for direct fusion to the host lipid membrane. In our present study, computer-aided drug design strategies were used for the identification of FDA-approved small molecules using the optimal structure of the S2 domain, which exhibits optimal interaction ratios, structural features, and energy variables, which were evaluated based on their performances in molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized Born model and solvent accessibility binding free energy calculations of molecular dynamics trajectories, and statistical inferences. Among the 2,625 FDA-approved small molecules, chloramphenicol succinate, imipenem, and imidurea turned out to be the molecules that bound the best at the fusion peptide hydrophobic pocket. The principal interactions of the selected molecules suggest that the potential binding site at the fusion peptide region is centralized amid the Lys790, Thr791, Lys795, Asp808, and Gln872 residues.

Since pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are potentially fatal complications of COVID-19, the present study tested the in vitro effectiveness of xylitol against SARS-CoV-2. Virus titers and LRV of SARS-CoV-2, were incubated with a single concentration of nasal spray. Toxicity was observed in the top dilution (1/10). Virus was seen below that dilution so it did not affect calculations of virus titer or LRV. After a 25-minute contact time, the nasal spray (11% Pure Xylitol, 0.85%NaCL (Saline), and 0.20% grapefruit seed extract) reduced virus from 4.2 to 1.7 log10 CCID50 per 0.1 mL, a statistically significant reduction (P<0.001) of 2.5 log10 CCID50. STEM Images obtained at the BIoCryo Laboratory revealed virus contained on the cell wall but none intra-cellular, possibly due to D-xylose (xylitol) production of glycoaminoglycans decoy targets. Xylitol and grapefruit seed extract are not exotic nor expensive rare high technology answers to viral epidemics. The potential in saving lives and the economies of the world by using X-GSE combination therapy should inspire large clinical trials, especially in those nations whereas the healthcare system would be dangerously compromised by the adoption of less effective and significantly more financially demanding therapies. Because there are no risk factors in using the X/GSE combination therapy, and the nasal spray is over the counter available without a prescription, and the spray allows for comfortable long term mask-wearing, adoption of this preventive anti-viral therapy should be encouraged.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In vitro effectiveness of xylitol against SARS-CoV-2 was tested and there were no risk factors in using the X/GSE combination therapy, and the nasal spray is over the counter available without a prescription, so adoption of this preventive anti-viral therapy should be encouraged."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3361,"details":{"paperId":"cdf2dad5fb4f43a967731749c6a4aece3ee68115","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7108130","MAG":"3009577418","DOI":"10.1093/cid/ciaa237","CorpusId":"212650711","PubMed":"32150618"},"title":"In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","abstract":"Abstract Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile. Results Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.

Many medicinal plants have antiviral, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, wound healing etc. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to screen for potent inhibitors of N-terminal domain (NTD) of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The structure of NTD of RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS coronavirus 2 was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB 6VYO) and the structures of 100 different phytocompounds were retrieved from Pubchem. The receptor protein and ligands were prepared using Schrodinger’s Protein Preparation Wizard. Molecular docking was done by using the Schrodinger’s maestro 12.0 software. Drug likeness and toxicity of active phytocompounds was predicted by using Swiss adme, admetSAR and protox II online servers. Molecular dynamic simulation of the best three protein- ligand complexes (alizarin, aloe-emodin and anthrarufin) was performed to study the interaction stability. We have identified three potential active sites (named as A, B, C) on receptor protein for efficient binding of the phytocompounds. We found that, among 100 phytocompounds, emodin, aloe-emodin, anthrarufin, alizarine, and dantron of Rheum emodi showed good binding affinity at all the three active sites of RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of COVID-19.The binding energies of emodin, aloe-emodin, anthrarufin, alizarine, and dantron were −8.299, −8.508, −8.456, −8.441, and −8.322 Kcal mol−1 respectively (site A), −7.714, −6.433, −6.354, −6.598, and −6.99 Kcal mol−1 respectively (site B), and −8.299, 8.508, 8.538, 8.841, and 8.322 Kcal mol−1 respectively (site C). All the active phytocompounds follows the drug likeness properties, non-carcinogenic, and non-toxic.

SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, its RNA polymerase, shares homology in the nucleotide uptake channel with the HCV orthologue enzyme NS5B. Besides, HCV enzyme NS5A has pleiotropic activities, such as RNA binding, that are shared with various SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Thus, anti-HCV NS5B and NS5A inhibitors, like sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, respectively, could be endowed with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Methods SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, HuH-7 cells, Calu-3 cells, neural stem cells and monocytes were used to investigate the effects of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. In silico and cell-free based assays were performed with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nsp12 to better comprehend the mechanism of inhibition of the investigated compounds. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was generated to estimate daclatasvir’s dose and schedule to maximize the probability of success for COVID-19. Results Daclatasvir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero, HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells, with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 μM, respectively. Although less potent than daclatasvir, sofosbuvir alone and combined with daclatasvir inhibited replication in Calu-3 cells. Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release of cytokine storm-related inflammatory mediators, respectively. Sofosbuvir inhibited RNA synthesis by chain termination and daclatasvir targeted the folding of secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Concentrations required for partial daclatasvir in vitro activity are achieved in plasma at Cmax after administration of the approved dose to humans.

Thus, there is always a quest to inhibit these ion channels, which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV2 in humans. Considering this, in the present study, authors employed computational approaches for studying the structure as well as function of the human ‘SARS-CoV2 E’ protein as well as its interaction with various phytochemicals. Result obtained revealed that α-helix and loops present in this protein experience random movement under optimal condition, which in turn modulate ion channel activity; thereby aiding the pathogenesis caused via SARS-CoV2 in human and other vertebrates. However, after binding with Belachinal, Macaflavanone E, and Vibsanol B, the random motion of the human ‘SARS-CoV2 E’ protein gets reduced, this, in turn, inhibits the function of the ‘SARS-CoV2 E’ protein. It is pertinent to note that two amino acids, namely VAL25 and PHE26, play a key role while interacting with these three phytochemicals. As these three phytochemicals, namely, Belachinal, Macaflavanone E & Vibsanol B, have passed the ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) property as well as ‘Lipinski’s Rule of 5s’, they may be utilized as drugs in controlling disease caused via SARS-COV2, after further investigation.

The cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, lymphocyte proliferation assays, enzyme-linked immunospot assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. The results showed that specific humoral and cellular immunities could be induced in mice by inoculating them with SARS-CoV spike DNA vaccine alone or by coinoculation with IL-2-expressing plasmids. In addition, the immune response levels in the coinoculation groups were significantly higher than those in groups receiving the spike DNA vaccine alone. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that oral vaccination evoked a vigorous T-cell response and a weak response predominantly with subclass immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibody. However, intramuscular immunization evoked a vigorous antibody response and a weak T-cell response, and vaccination by electroporation evoked a vigorous response with a predominant subclass IgG1 antibody response and a moderate T-cell response. Our findings show that the spike DNA vaccine has good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunities in BALB/c mice, while IL-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances the humoral and cellular immune responses.

Endosomal cathepsins carry out the cleavages. We have constructed chimeric forms of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing the fusion proteins of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) or SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and shown that two small-molecule inhibitors of an endosomal lipid kinase (PIKfyve) inhibit viral infection by preventing release of the viral contents from endosomes. Both inhibitory compounds cause distension of Rab5 and Rab7 subcompartments into small vacuoles. One of them (Apilimod) also inhibits infection of cells by authentic SARS-CoV-2. The results point to possibilities for host targets of antiviral drugs. Virus entry is a multistep process. It initiates when the virus attaches to the host cell and ends when the viral contents reach the cytosol. Genetically unrelated viruses can subvert analogous subcellular mechanisms and use similar trafficking pathways for successful entry. Antiviral strategies targeting early steps of infection are therefore appealing, particularly when the probability for successful interference through a common step is highest. We describe here potent inhibitory effects on content release and infection by chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing the envelope proteins of Zaire ebolavirus (VSV-ZEBOV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) elicited by Apilimod and Vacuolin-1, small-molecule inhibitors of the main endosomal phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate/phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase, PIKfyve.

Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry.

Here, we provide biochemical, structural and functional characterizations of PLpro from SARS-CoV-2 (PLproCoV2) and reveal differences to that of SARS (PLproSARS) in controlling interferon (IFN) and NF-kB pathways. PLproCoV2 and PLproSARS share 83% sequence identity, yet they differ in their host substrate preferences: PLproCoV2 predominantly cleaves the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 off from host proteins, while PLproSARS preferentially targets ubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of PLproCoV2 in complex with ISG15 explains the affinity and higher specificity through distinctive binding to ISG15’s unique amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, and enabled the identification of GRL-0617 as a non-covalent candidate inhibitor for PLproCoV2. In human cells, PLproCoV2 cleaves ISG15 from interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3), blocks its nuclear translocation, and reduces type I interferon responses, whereas PLproSARS preferentially mediates deubiquitination of critical components of the NF-kB pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of PLproCoV2 blocks the virus-induced cytopathogenic effect upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, fosters the anti- viral interferon pathway and reduces viral release from infected cells.

Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection. In this study, we used a cellular model of adhesion to investigate whether natural antibodies of the ABO system could block the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. To this aim, a C-terminally EGFP-tagged S protein was expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with an α1,2-fucosyltransferase and an A-transferase in order to coexpress the S glycoprotein ectodomain and the A antigen at the cell surface. We observed that the S protein/angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-dependent adhesion of these cells to an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressing cell line was specifically inhibited by either a monoclonal or human natural anti-A antibodies, indicating that these antibodies may block the interaction between the virus and its receptor, thereby providing protection. In order to more fully appreciate the potential effect of the ABO polymorphism on the epidemiology of SARS, we built a mathematical model of the virus transmission dynamics that takes into account the protective effect of ABO natural antibodies.

The P-PMO were tested for their capacity to inhibit production of infectious virus as well as to probe the function of conserved viral RNA motifs and secondary structures. Several virus-targeted P-PMO and a random-sequence control P-PMO showed low inhibitory activity against SARS coronavirus. Certain other virus-targeted P-PMO reduced virus-induced cytopathology and cell-to-cell spread as a consequence of decreasing viral amplification. Active P-PMO were effective when administered at any time prior to peak viral synthesis and exerted sustained antiviral effects while present in culture medium. P-PMO showed low nonspecific inhibitory activity against translation of nontargeted RNA or growth of the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Two P-PMO targeting the viral transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS) region in the 5′ untranslated region were the most effective inhibitors tested. After several viral passages in the presence of a TRS-targeted P-PMO, partially drug-resistant SARS-CoV mutants arose which contained three contiguous base point mutations at the binding site of a TRS-targeted P-PMO.

Biomedical data can help to investigate new aspects of the COVID-19 pathogenesis, but source heterogeneity represents a major drawback and limitation.

Implications for COVID‐19","abstract":"To the Editor: The safety ofNSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, inCOVID19 has been openly questioned.1 Many review or opinion articles have discussed whether NSAIDs increase or decrease tissue levels (particularly lung levels) of ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) and whether this may increase or decrease the severity of COVID-19. An increase in ACE2 activity is essential to balance the tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) against the inflammatory response (see Figure S1), and several recent studies have emphasized the pivotal role of tissue RAS in severity of COVID-19.2 Adversely, upregulation of ACE2, as viral entry receptor, may increase cell infection. However, other proteases such as ADAM17 (TACE, TNF-αconverting enzyme) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are also major mechanisms for the viral entry.3,4 Available experimental data are scarce and controversial. We investigated the effects of ibuprofen on lung levels of ACE2 and other major compounds of the lung RAS, both in healthy adult rats and in a well-known rat model of metabolic syndrome (MetS; rats with obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia). It is known that patients with MetS are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19. In vitro, we used human alveolar type-II pneumocyte cells to study the effects of ibuprofen on changes induced by viral spike protein on ACE2 levels, on levels of spike protein internalization, ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 activities, and on the release of major COVID-19-related cytokines. Details on methods are provided as Supporting Information. In healthy adult rats, treatment with ibuprofen (40 mg/kg) significantly increased lung ACE2 expression and enzymatic activity, and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory RAS axis receptors (Mas and angiotensin type 2; AT2); furthermore, ibuprofen induced a significant decrease in proinflammatory AT1 receptor expression (Figure 1A–C).

Cytokine profiles observed in COVID-19 patients have revealed increased levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α and increased NF-κB pathway activity. Recent evidence has shown that the upregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway is associated with inflammation, resulting in a cytokine storm in ARDS (acute respire distress syndrome) and especially in COVID-19 patients. Several studies have shown that the WNT/β-catenin pathway interacts with PPARγ in an opposing interplay in numerous diseases. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the interesting role of PPARγ agonists as modulators of inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs through the targeting of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV2 infection presents a decrease in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) associated with the upregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. SARS-Cov2 may invade human organs besides the lungs through the expression of ACE2. Evidence has highlighted the fact that PPARγ agonists can increase ACE2 expression, suggesting a possible role for PPARγ agonists in the treatment of COVID-19.

Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. Methods and findings This is the first edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19. We planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review is based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines, and our 8-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and nonserious adverse events. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. We searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until August 7, 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology. We included 33 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 13,312 participants. All trials were at overall high risk of bias. We identified one trial randomizing 6,425 participants to dexamethasone versus standard care. This trial showed evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (rate ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–0.93; p < 0.001; low certainty) and on mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.62–0.95; p = 0.021; low certainty). It was possible to perform meta-analysis of 10 comparisons. Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between remdesivir versus placebo on all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40–1.37; p = 0.34, I2 = 58%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.80–1.11; p = 0.48, I2 = 29%; 2 trials; low certainty). Meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial effect of remdesivir versus placebo on serious adverse events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63–0.94; p = 0.009, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) mainly driven by respiratory failure in one trial. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses showed that we could exclude the possibility that hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.97–1.19; p = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) and serious adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96–1.18; p = 0.21; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) by 20% or more, and meta-analysis showed evidence of a harmful effect on nonserious adverse events (RR 2.40; 95% CI 2.01–2.87; p < 0.00001; I2 = 90%; 6 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between lopinavir–ritonavir versus standard care on serious adverse events (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.39–1.04; p = 0.07, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.85–1.53; p = 0.38, I2 = 75%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between convalescent plasma versus standard care on all-cause mortality (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.33–1.10; p = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Five single trials showed statistically significant results but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. None of the remaining trials showed evidence of a difference on our predefined outcomes. Because of the lack of relevant data, it was not possible to perform other meta-analyses, network meta-analysis, or individual patient data meta-analyses. The main limitation of this living review is the paucity of data currently available. Furthermore, the included trials were all at risks of systematic errors and random errors. Conclusions Our results show that dexamethasone and remdesivir might be beneficial for COVID-19 patients, but the certainty of the evidence was low to very low, so more trials are needed. We can exclude the possibility of hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reducing the risk of death and serious adverse events by 20% or more. Otherwise, no evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists.

SARS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 as a receptor for cell entry and infection. While both ACE inhibitors and spironolactone can upregulate tissue ACE2, there are important points of discrimination between these approaches. The virus requires proteolytic processing of its spike protein by transmembrane protease receptor serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) to enable binding to cellular ACE2. Since TMPRSS2 contains an androgen promoter, it may be downregulated by the antiandrogenic actions of spironolactone. Furin and plasmin also process the spike protein. They are inhibited by protease nexin 1 or serine E2 (PN1) that is upregulated by angiotensin II but downregulated by aldosterone. Therefore, spironolactone should selectively downregulate furin and plasmin. Furin also promotes pulmonary edema while plasmin promotes hemovascular dysfunction. Thus, a downregulation of furin and plasmin by PN1 could be a further benefit of MRAs beyond their well established organ protection.

Among antimalarial drugs of such potential is ivermectin (IVM), a macrocyclic lactone of Nobel Prize-winning distinction. A retrospective study of 173 COVID-19 patients treated with IVM in four Florida hospitals at a dose of 200 µg/kg yielded a 40% reduction in mortality compared with 107 controls (15.0% vs. 25.2%, p=0.03). Mortality was cut by 52% with IVM for patients having severe pulmonary disease (38.8% vs. 80.7%, p=0.001). Stabilization and then improvement over 1-2 days frequently occurred for patients who had rapidly deteriorating oxygen status. \n \nIt is proposed that higher doses of IVM could yield sharply greater clinical benefits. In several clinical studies, IVM at doses of up to 2,000 µg/kg, ten times that used in the Florida study, were well tolerated. The potential for major dose-response gains is evaluated based upon studies indicating that IVM shields SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and that this spike protein binds to the CD147 transmembrane receptor as well as to ACE2. The abundant distribution of CD147 on red blood cells (RBCs) suggests a hypothesized “catch” and “clump” framework whereby virally-mediated bindings of RBCs to other RBCs, platelets, white blood cells and capillary walls impede blood flow, which in turn may underlie key morbidities of COVID-19. \n \nThe proposed catch and clump scenario for COVID-19 has a parallel in malaria, for which CD147 is central to the infectious process. The core morbidity of severe malaria is caused by similar clumps and adhesions to endothelium centering around infected RBCs. These underlie the much greater incidence of severe malaria for blood groups A or B vs. O, caused by adhesive RBC membrane trisaccharides associated with blood groups A and B. COVID-19 is likewise much more prevalent for blood groups A or B vs. O. More generally, hemagglutination, the formation of such RBC-pathogen clusters, is common for enveloped viruses. Under this hypothesized framework, a significantly higher rate of capillary flow in younger people could explain a corresponding decreased severity of COIVD-19. This proposed hypothesis and the associated potential for major IVM dose-response gains could be tested, for example, by monitoring blood flow in COVID-19 patients before and after IVM intake using nailfold capillaroscopy.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The proposed catch and clump scenario for COVID-19 has a parallel in malaria, for which CD147 is central to the infectious process, and a significantly higher rate of capillary flow in younger people could explain a corresponding decreased severity of COIVD-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5198,"details":{"paperId":"c3809bf594788747392d65999cbfbe5d581242af","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1186/s12941-020-00368-w","CorpusId":"255853348"},"title":"Ivermectin, a new candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":401,"details":{"paperId":"091d0dd18e326d3d0740e931963a8089149683cb","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s00210-020-01902-5","CorpusId":"253741608"},"title":"Ivermectin, antiviral properties and COVID-19: a possible new mechanism of action","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This paper proposes an alternative mechanism of action for this drug that makes it capable of having an antiviral action, also against the novel coronavirus, in addition to the processes already reported in literature."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1784,"details":{"paperId":"885162cd387cc46b6c92536a48be8f11ec606a40","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8383101","DOI":"10.1016/j.nmni.2021.100924","CorpusId":"237316828","PubMed":"34466270"},"title":"Ivermectin: a multifaceted drug of Nobel prize-honoured distinction with indicated efficacy against a new global scourge, COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The indicated biological mechanism of IVM, competitive binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, is likely non-epitope specific, possibly yielding full efficacy against emerging viral mutant strains."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4942,"details":{"paperId":"19fa491108d4ede83ab546896fd9b9c782dffce2","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7270061","MAG":"3022534749","DOI":"10.1159/000508247","CorpusId":"218599711","PubMed":"32392562"},"title":"JAK Inhibition as a New Treatment Strategy for Patients with COVID-19","abstract":"After the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) commenced across the world.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor.

Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus-kinase (JAK) inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients for their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and by their ability to promote viral clearance in past coronaviruses, respectively. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate role of these therapies in COVID-19 patients. Methods MEDLINE and MedRxiv were searched until July 30th, 2020, including studies that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with JAK-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clear risk estimates or those that permitted back-calculation. Results We searched 733 studies, ultimately including four randomized and eleven non-randomized clinical trials. JAK-inhibitor recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95%CI, 0.03-0.39, p=0.0005) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95%CI, 0.01-0.26, p=0.0005), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95%CI, 10.68-48.54, p<0.00001), when compared to standard treatment group.

Although inflammation is protective, uncontrolled excessive inflammation can cause inflammatory diseases and can be detrimental, such as in COVID-19. However, the underlying mechanisms that control inflammasome activation are incompletely understood. Here we report that the leucine rich repeat (LRR) protein Ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1), which shares homology with LRRs of NLRP proteins, attenuates inflammasome activation. Deletion of RNH1 in macrophages increases IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation for inflammasome stimuli. Mechanistically, RNH1 decreases pro-IL-1β expression and induces proteasome-mediated caspase-1 degradation. Corroborating this, mouse models of monosodium urate (MSU)-induced peritonitis and LPS-induced endotoxemia, which are dependent on caspase-1, respectively show increased neutrophil infiltration and lethality in Rnh1-/- mice compared to WT mice.

In the last decade, several interferon-inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH, and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as a host factor that facilitates the entry of several human-pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection. ABSTRACT C3A is a subclone of the human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line with strong contact inhibition of growth. We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2), gamma-interferon-inducible lysosome/endosome-localized thiolreductase (GILT), and lymphocyte antigen 6 family member E (LY6E), the three cellular proteins identified to function in interference with virus entry, were expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-O43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFN-inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) restriction of human coronavirus (CoV) entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a mechanism distinct from other factors that modulate CoV entry.

S protein is heavily glycosylated and the glycosylation sites are relatively conserved, thus glycans on S protein surface could be a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies against variants. Here, we collected 12 plant-derived lectins with different carbohydrate specificity and evaluated their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against mutant strains and epidemic variants using a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. The Lens culinaris-derived lentil lectin which specifically bind to oligomannose-type glycans and GlcNAc at the non-reducing end terminus showed most potent and broad antiviral activity against a panel of mutant strains and variants, including the artificial mutants at N-/O-linked glycosylation site, natural existed amino acid mutants, as well as the epidemic variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Lentil lectin also showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found lentil lectin could block the binding of ACE2 to S trimer and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the early steps of infection. Using structural information and determined N-glycan profile of S trimer, taking together with the carbohydrate specificity of lentil lectin, we provide a basis for the observed broad spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Lentil lectin showed weak haemagglutination activity at 1 mg/mL and no cytotoxicity activity, and no weight loss was found in single injection mouse experiment.

Despite numerous preliminary results, there is as yet no treatment of proven efficacy for this condition. In this context, the pharmacological properties of lithium, better known as a treatment for mood disorders, merit closer examination. Lithium has shown in vitro efficacy at inhibiting the replication of coronaviruses responsible for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in animals. It has immunomodulatory properties that may be of additional benefit in moderating the host inflammatory response to the novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2). Furthermore, there is evidence that lithium may exert a protective action against upper respiratory infections and influenza‐like illnesses in patients taking it for other indications. These promising reports must be balanced against the narrow therapeutic index and high risk of toxicity associated with lithium therapy, its documented interactions with several commonly used drugs, and the absence of evidence of its efficacy against coronaviruses responsible for human disease. Nevertheless, naturalistic studies of the risk of COVID‐19 in patients already receiving lithium could provide indirect evidence of its efficacy, and understanding the putative antiviral and immune‐regulatory mechanisms of lithium in models of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may provide leads for the development of safer and more effective treatments with a specific action against COVID‐19.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"There is evidence that lithium may exert a protective action against upper respiratory infections and influenza‐like illnesses in patients taking it for other indications, and understanding the putative antiviral and immune‐regulatory mechanisms of lithium in models of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may provide leads for the development of safer and more effective treatments with a specific action against COVID‐19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1593,"details":{"paperId":"a08921bd2cdca50a6029a5a18135dacfb6d73cf0","externalIds":{"MAG":"3014800957","PubMedCentral":"7194913","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.032","CorpusId":"216131679","PubMed":"32331982"},"title":"Lopinavir/ritonavir did not shorten the duration of SARS CoV-2 shedding in patients with mild pneumonia in Taiwan","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An increase of Ct values was 0.9 per day in 2 cases of COVID-19 treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), indicating that LPV/ r did not shorten the duration of SARS CoV-2 shedding."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2083,"details":{"paperId":"00d5876fd343bff98fb896f41cfc5339db9ff1ac","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7535623","MAG":"3090929175","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32013-4","CorpusId":"222135901","PubMed":"33031764"},"title":"Lopinavir–ritonavir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2409,"details":{"paperId":"cfdea2902f9aeb24e979be1018751b46efab1ed3","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7654848","MAG":"3099547889","DOI":"10.1038/s41375-020-01087-z","CorpusId":"226294285","PubMed":"33173161"},"title":"Low-dose ruxolitinib plus steroid in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Both treated and control groups were comparable, with the exception of comorbidities, which were slightly over-represented in the control group, although not significantly (Table 1)."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6398,"details":{"paperId":"b29f41d7eb43a5bf0a554274b5ec283f08ed0fb0","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7901604","DOI":"10.7326/M20-8148","CorpusId":"231867069","PubMed":"33560863"},"title":"Major Update: Remdesivir for Adults With COVID-19","abstract":"Remdesivir is being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.

A multi-coronavirus protein microarray used to map the binding of COVID-19 patient antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and protein fragments as well as to the proteins of four other coronaviruses that infect humans has shown specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are highly reactive with patient antibodies and revealed cross-reactivity of these antibodies with other human coronaviruses. ABSTRACT The rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated research and development for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. A multi-coronavirus protein microarray was created containing full-length proteins, overlapping protein fragments of various lengths, and peptide libraries from SARS-CoV-2 and four other human coronaviruses. Sera from confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as unexposed individuals were applied to multicoronavirus arrays to identify specific antibody reactivity. High-level IgG, IgM, and IgA reactivity to structural proteins S, M, and N of SARS-CoV-2, as well as accessory proteins such as ORF3a and ORF7a, were observed that were specific to COVID-19 patients. Antibody reactivity against overlapping 100-, 50-, and 30-amino acid fragments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins was used to identify antigenic regions. Numerous proteins of SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were also more reactive with IgG, IgM, and IgA in COVID-19 patient sera than in unexposed control sera, providing further evidence of immunologic cross-reactivity between these viruses. Whereas unexposed individuals had minimal reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins that poorly correlated with reactivity against HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 S2 and N proteins, COVID-19 patient sera had higher correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV responses, suggesting that de novo antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 cross-react with HCoV epitopes. Array responses were compared with validated spike protein-specific IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), showing agreement between orthologous methods. SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization titers were low in the COVID-19 patient sera but correlated with array responses against S and N proteins. The multi-coronavirus protein microarray is a useful tool for mapping antibody reactivity in COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE With novel mutant SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern on the rise, knowledge of immune specificities against SARS-CoV-2 proteins is increasingly important for understanding the impact of structural changes in antibody-reactive protein epitopes on naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity, as well as broader topics of cross-reactivity and viral evolution.

However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. Methods We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2/25/20 and 6/22/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. Results The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95% CI 2.19–3.10; p<0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.64–2.28; p<0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95% CI 2.07–2.93; p<0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.78–2.48; p<0.0001).

In the particular case of SARS-COV-2 its mechanism of action remains elusive and controversial. Interestingly, the energy of interaction of ivermectin with any of the proteins the SARS-CoV-2 and the possible structural alterations at the protein level that this drug can cause have not been reported. In this sense, we carried out a bioinformatics study with docking strategies and molecular dynamics to predict the binding and disturbance induced by ivermectin in proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2.

Followed by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses in 2003 SARS-CoV, in 2012 MERS-CoV, now in 2019 pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, is associated with a global “pandemic” situation. In humans, the effects of these viruses are correlated with viral pneumonia, severe respiratory tract infections. It is believed that interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor and viral Spike protein mediates the coronavirus entry into human respiratory epithelial cells and establishes the host tropism. ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in airway epithelial cells. Along with viral-receptor interaction, proteolytic cleavability of S protein has been considered as the determinant of disease severity. Several studies highlight the occurrence of impaired host immune response and expression of excessive inflammatory response especially cytokines against viral infection. The mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced acute lung injury are still undefined; however, the term cytokine storm has now been recognized to be closely associated with COVID-19. The levels of inflammatory mediators from cytokine storm cause damage to the host cells. In particular, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 appears to be the key mediator in early phase of virus-receptor interaction; however, secreted IL-6 might not be representative of lung inflammation. Understanding the cellular, and molecular factors involved in immune dysregulation and the high virulence capacity of COVID-19 will help in potential targeted therapy against it. “Drug repurposing” and “molecular docking analysis” is considered as an attractive alternative approach in analyzing suitable drug candidates to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We identified eight human MAbs binding to virus and infected cells, six of which could be mapped to two SARS-CoV structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins. Two MAbs reacted with N protein. One of the N protein MAbs recognized a linear epitope conserved between all published human and animal SARS-CoV isolates, and the other bound to a nonlinear N epitope. These two N MAbs did not compete for binding to SARS-CoV. Four MAbs reacted with the S glycoprotein, and three of these MAbs neutralized SARS-CoV in vitro. All three neutralizing anti-S MAbs bound a recombinant S1 fragment comprising residues 318 to 510, a region previously identified as the SARS-CoV S receptor binding domain; the nonneutralizing MAb did not. Two strongly neutralizing anti-S1 MAbs blocked the binding of a recombinant S fragment (residues 1 to 565) to SARS-CoV-susceptible Vero cells completely, whereas a poorly neutralizing S1 MAb blocked binding only partially. The MAb ability to block S1-receptor binding and the level of neutralization of the two strongly neutralizing S1 MAbs correlated with the binding affinity to the S1 domain. Finally, epitope mapping, using recombinant S fragments (residues 318 to 510) containing naturally occurring mutations, revealed the importance of residue N479 for the binding of the most potent neutralizing MAb, CR3014.

Recently, global attention has turned to preliminary reports on the promising anti-COVID-19 effect of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), most especially Famotidine. Therefore, this study was designed to exploit a possible molecular basis for the efficacy of H2RAs against coronavirus. Molecular docking was performed between four H2RAs, Cimetidine, Famotidine, Nizatidine, Ranitidine, and three non-structural proteins viz. NSP3, NSP7/8 complex, and NSP9. Thereafter, a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out with the most outstanding ligands to determine the stability. Thereafter, Famotidine and Cimetidine were subjected to gene target prediction analysis using HitPickV2 and eXpression2Kinases server to determine the possible network of genes associated with their anti-COVID activities. Results obtained from molecular docking showed the superiority of Famotidine and Cimetidine compared to other H2RAs with a higher binding affinity to all selected targets. Molecular dynamic simulation and MMPBSA results revealed that Famotidine as well as Cimetidine bind to non-structural proteins more efficiently with high stability over 100 ns. Results obtained suggest that Famotidine and Cimetidine could be a viable option to treat COVID-19 with a mechanism of action that involves the inhibition of viral replication through the inhibition of non-structural proteins.

Since de novo drug discovery is both expensive and time-consuming, drug repurposing approaches are believed to be of particular help. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is known to attach human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD). We screened 1930 FDA-approved ligands for the selection of optimal ones blocking this interaction. Virtual screening predicted top 25 ligands docking to any of the reported binding sites. After exclusion of those ligands which were unsuitable for systemic use, the remaining 69 RBD-ligand complexes were screened based on the masking capacity of the amino acid residues engaged in RBD-hACE2 interaction, excluding 47 RBD-ligand complexes. A short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis identified 11 globally stable complexes with the lowest RMSD (root-mean-square deviation). Next, a moderately long MD analysis revealed those six RBD-ligand complexes with the lowest RMSD variation, as a measure of global stability. Finally, a long MD analysis revealed two select candidate ligands, including ritonavir and naloxegol, highly stabilizing those key residues engaged in RBD-hACE2 interaction. A similar MD analysis of a few antiviral drugs which are under clinical trials or approved for COVID-19 treatment showed them inferior to both select ligands in terms of stabilizing the RBD globally and locally at binding sites.

However, the molecular recognition mechanism—critical information for drug and antibody design—has not been fully clarified at the amino acid residue level. Elucidating such a microscopic mechanism in detail requires a more accurate molecular interpretation that includes quantum mechanics to quantitatively evaluate hydrogen bonds, XH/π interactions (X = N, O, and C), and salt bridges. In this study, we applied the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding interactions with not only ACE2 but also the B38 Fab antibody involved in ACE2-inhibitory binding. By analyzing FMO-based interaction energies along a wide range of binding interfaces carefully, we identified amino acid residues critical for molecular recognition between S-protein and ACE2 or B38 Fab antibody. Importantly, hydrophobic residues that are involved in weak interactions such as CH–O hydrogen bond and XH/π interactions, as well as polar residues that construct conspicuous hydrogen bonds, play important roles in molecular recognition and binding ability. Moreover, through these FMO-based analyses, we also clarified novel hot spots and epitopes that had been overlooked in previous studies by structural and molecular mechanical approaches. Altogether, these hot spots/epitopes identified between S-protein and ACE2/B38 Fab antibody may provide useful information for future antibody design, evaluation of the binding property of the SARS-CoV-2 variants including its N501Y, and small or medium drug design against the SARS-CoV-2.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study applied the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding interactions with not only ACE2 but also the B38 Fab antibody involved in ACE2-inhibitory binding, and identified amino acid residues critical for molecular recognition between S- protein and ACE2 or B 38 Fab antibody."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2558,"details":{"paperId":"11513a0125a08eb118ac96cd9302f9128c93077c","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-16779-4","CorpusId":"256633576"},"title":"Molecular structure analyses suggest strategies to therapeutically target SARS-CoV-2","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In this commentary, some of the latest studies that provide atomic-resolution structural details imperative for the development of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics are highlighted."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5551,"details":{"paperId":"cadaafef53ef6fc948f6035548b11402dcd6cfd4","externalIds":{"MAG":"2153703950","DOI":"10.18433/J3J019","CorpusId":"6937816","PubMed":"19203466"},"title":"Molecular targets for diagnostics and therapeutics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV).","abstract":"PURPOSE\nThe large number of deaths in a short period of time due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection led to the unparalleled collaborative efforts world wide to determine and characterize the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the first outbreak by the Canadian group with international collaboration. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the continual lack of a rapid laboratory test to aid the early diagnosis of suspected cases of SARS makes this area a priority for future research. To prevent deaths in the future, early diagnosis and therapy of this infectious disease is of paramount importance.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis review describes the specific molecular targets for diagnostics and therapeutics of viral infection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe three major diagnostic methods available for SARS includes viral RNA detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus induced antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) of nucleocapsid protein (NP). The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein contains multiple conformational epitopes that induces highly potent neutralizing antibodies. The genetically engineered attenuated form of the virus or viral vector vaccine encoding for the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein has been shown to elicit protective immunity in vaccinated animals.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNP is the preferred target for routine detection of SARS-CoV infection by ELISA which is an economical method compared to other methods. The RBD of the spike glycoprotein is both a functional domain for cell receptor binding and also a major neutralizing determinant of SARS-CoV.

Attention has focused on the development of vaccines, new antiviral agents, and convalescent plasma infusions. Monoclonal antibodies have received less attention even though neutralizing antibodies are a key component of protective immunity for most viral diseases. Neutral izing monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have the potential for both therapeutic and prophylactic applications, and can help to guide vaccine design and development.1 Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent of COVID-19, numerous research groups have isolated monoclonal antibodies (most often from the B cells of patients who have recently recovered from SARS-CoV-2, and in some cases from individuals who were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] in 2003). It is also possible to generate effective monoclonal antibodies by immunization of humanized mice. Modern methods allow the rapid identification of pathogen-specific B cells and recovery of immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain genes that can be expressed to produce monoclonal antibodies, usually in the form of IgG. The main target of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies is the surface spike glycoprotein that mediates viral entry into host cells. Essentially all monoclonal antibodies of interest target this protein. Viral infection is mediated by the interaction between the viral spike and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor found on numerous cell types, but neutralizing monoclonal antibodies block this event.

Because leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast have been shown to reduce both cytokine release and lung inflammation in preclinical models of viral influenza and acute respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesized that therapy with montelukast could be used to treat COVID-19. The objective of this study was to determine if montelukast treatment would reduce the rate of clinical deterioration as measured by the COVID-19 Ordinal Scale. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 confirmed hospitalized patients treated with or without montelukast. We used “clinical deterioration” as the primary endpoint, a binary outcome defined as any increase in the Ordinal Scale value from Day 1 to Day 3 of the hospital stay, as these data were uniformly available for all admitted patients before hospital discharge. Rates of clinical deterioration between the montelukast and non-montelukast groups were compared using the Fisher’s exact test. Univariate logistic regression was also used to assess the association between montelukast use and clinical deterioration. A total of 92 patients were analyzed, 30 who received montelukast at the discretion of the treating physician and 62 patients who did not receive montelukast. Results Patients receiving montelukast experienced significantly fewer events of clinical deterioration compared with patients not receiving montelukast (10% vs 32%, p = 0.022). Our findings suggest that montelukast associates with a reduction in clinical deterioration for COVID-19 confirmed patients as measured on the COVID-19 Ordinal Scale.

One to three units (each of 250-300 mL) of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibody titer ≥1:160) were administered. The primary outcome measure was 7-day hospital mortality. Secondary study outcomes were PaO2/FiO2, changes in laboratory and radiological parameters, weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety of the intervention. The study enrolled 46 patients between March 25 and April 21, 2020. The mean age of the patients was 63 years and 61% were male. Thirty of the patients were on continuous positive airway pressure and seven were intubated. The mean PaO2/FiO2 was 128 (standard deviation [SD] 47).

The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that affected more than 215 countries with over 23 million cases and 800,000 deaths as of today. The situation is critical, especially with the absence of specific medicines or vaccines; hence, efforts toward the development of anti-COVID-19 medicines are being intensively undertaken. One of the potential therapeutic targets of anti-COVID-19 drugs is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 was identified as a key functional receptor for CoV associated with COVID-19. ACE2, which is located on the surface of the host cells, binds effectively to the spike protein of CoV, thus enabling the virus to infect the epithelial cells of the host. Previous studies showed that certain flavonoids exhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition activity, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure. Thus, it is being postulated that these flavonoids might also interact with ACE2. This postulation might be of interest because these compounds also show antiviral activity in vitro. This article summarizes the natural flavonoids with potential efficacy against COVID-19 through ACE2 receptor inhibition.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This article summarizes the natural flavonoids with potential efficacy against COVID-19 through ACE2 receptor inhibition through angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition activity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3167,"details":{"paperId":"2897619376bee871fb78b6b020cf68da87747603","externalIds":{"MAG":"3036486867","PubMedCentral":"7309333","DOI":"10.1080/07391102.2020.1780947","CorpusId":"219904751","PubMed":"32552595"},"title":"Natural compounds from Clerodendrum spp. as possible therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2: An in silico investigation","abstract":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rattled global public health, with researchers struggling to find specific therapeutic solutions. In this context, the present study employed an in silico approach to assess the inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals obtained from GC-MS analysis of twelve Clerodendrum species against the imperative spike protein, main protease enzyme Mpro and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. An extensive molecular docking investigation of the phytocompounds at the active binding pockets of the viral proteins revealed promising inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals taraxerol, friedelin and stigmasterol. Decent physicochemical attributes of the compounds in accordance with Lipinski’s rule of five and Veber’s rule further established them as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding free energy estimation revealed that taraxerol was the most promising candidate displaying the highest binding efficacy with all the concerned SARS-CoV-2 proteins included in the present analysis. Our observations were supported by robust molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes of the viral proteins with taraxerol for a timescale of 40 nanoseconds. It was striking to note that taraxerol exhibited better binding energy scores with the concerned viral proteins than the drugs that are specifically targeted against them.

The extent of spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of recent blood donors in Scotland to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection. Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 1000 blood donors collected in Scotland during March, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Findings. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 5 of the 500 samples collected 21st to 23rd March; one further sample was reactive in an anti-spike ELISA. Interpretation. Although we cannot use the rise in numbers seropositive to infer the contemporary seroprevalence or the growth rate of the epidemic, we note that they are consistent with frequency of reported diagnosed infections and SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths reported in that time period in Scotland, given that seroconversion takes up to 2-3 weeks. It should also be noted that blood donors are not representative of the general population; in particular, those with a history of recent respiratory infections are deferred. Finally, it is unknown what proportion of infected individuals seroconvert and become reactive in the assays used.

The B.1.1.7 isolate identified in the United Kingdom and B.1.351 isolate identified in the Republic of South Africa encode spike proteins with multiple mutations in the S1 and S2 subunits. In addition, variants have been identified in Columbus, Ohio (COH.20G/677H), Europe (20A.EU2) and in domesticated minks. Analysis by antibody neutralization of pseudotyped viruses showed that convalescent sera from patients infected prior to the emergence of the variant viruses neutralized viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, COH.20G/677H Columbus Ohio, 20A.EU2 Europe and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor decrease in titer compared to that of the earlier D614G spike protein.

Vaccine elicited antibodies neutralized virus with the B.1.1.7 spike protein with titers similar to D614G virus and neutralized virus with the B.1.351 spike with, on average, a 3-fold reduction in titer (1:500), a titer that was still higher than the average titer with which convalescent sera neutralized D614G (1:139). The reduction in titer was attributable to the E484K mutation in the RBD.

A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR-positive viral test with a cycle threshold (CT) of <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested that the outbreak originated largely from a single viral clade. Only three crew members tested seropositive prior to the boat’s departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of the crew members with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak.

Many of these glycoproteins, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein form trimeric units in the membrane of the native virion. There is substantial experimental and pre-clinical evidence showing that the S protein is a promising lead for vaccines and therapeutics. Previously we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to whole inactivated SARS-CoV which neutralize the virus in vitro. 1,2 Here, we define their specificity and affinity, map several of their epitopes and lastly characterise chimeric versions of them. Our data show that the neutralizing mAbs bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS S protein. Three of the chimeric mAbs retain their binding specificity while one conformational mAb, F26G19, lost its ability to bind the S protein despite high level expression. The affinity for recombinant S is maintained in all of the functional chimeric versions of the parental mAbs. Both parental mAb F26G18 and the chimeric version neutralize the TOR2 strain of SARS-CoV with essentially identical titres (2.07 and 2.47 nM, respectively). Lastly, a comparison with other neutralizing mAbs to SARS-CoV clearly shows that the dominance of a 33 amino acid residue loop of the SARS-CoV RBD is independent of repertoire, species, quaternary structure, and importantly, the technology used to derive the mAbs. In cases like this, the dominance of a compact RBD antigenic domain and the central role of the S protein in pathogenesis may inherently create immunoselection pressure on viruses to evolve more complex evasion strategies or die out of a host species.

We were the first to report the analogous biological and physiological features of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the harmful amplification loop between inflammation and tissue damage induced by the dysregulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. Given the rapid evolution of this disease, the nature of its symptoms, and its potential lethality, we hypothesize that COVID-19 progresses under just such an amplifier loop, leading to a massive, uncontrolled inflammation process. Here, we describe in-depth the correlations of COVID-19 symptoms and biological features with those where uncontrolled NET formation is implicated in various sterile or infectious diseases. General clinical conditions, as well as numerous pathological and biological features, are analogous with NETs deleterious effects. Among NETs by-products implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis, one of the most significant appears to be elastase, in accelerating virus entry and inducing hypertension, thrombosis and vasculitis. We postulate that severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) may evade innate immune response, causing uncontrolled NETs formation and multi-organ failure. In addition, we point to indicators that NETS-associated diseases are COVID-19 risk factors. Acknowledging that neutrophils are the principal origin of extracellular and circulating DNA release, we nonetheless, explain why targeting NETs rather than neutrophils themselves may in practice be a better strategy. This paper also offers an in-depth review of NET formation, function and pathogenic dysregulation, as well as of current and prospective future therapies to control NETopathies. As such, it enables us also to suggest new therapeutic strategies to fight COVID-19. In combination with or independent of the latest tested approaches, we propose the evaluation, in the short term, of treatments with DNase-1, with the anti-diabetic Metformin, or with drugs targeting elastase (i.e., Silvelestat). With a longer perspective, we also advocate a significant increase in research on the development of toll-like receptors (TLR) and C-type lectin-like receptors (CLEC) inhibitors, NET-inhibitory peptides, and on anti-IL-26 therapies.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is speculated that severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) may evade innate immune response, causing uncontrolled NETs formation and multi-organ failure, and an in-depth review of NET formation, function and pathogenic dysregulation, as well as of current and prospective future therapies to control NETopathies is offered."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6086,"details":{"paperId":"459b7c7ab9ae02a7f6f7b0543c42fa0df7a93bba","externalIds":{"MAG":"3049277939","PubMedCentral":"7461590","DOI":"10.3390/ijms21165856","CorpusId":"221239590","PubMed":"32824072"},"title":"New Anti SARS-Cov-2 Targets for Quinoline Derivatives Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine †","abstract":"The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a severe global health crisis.

We performed multiple sequence alignments of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus, including SARS, OC43, MERS, NL63, 229E, and HKU1, using RaTG13, a Bat-SARS-like coronavirus, as a control and found that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 maintains the highest homology (96%) sequence with RaTG13, and 75% of homology sequence with SARS-CoV, but is significantly different from other human coronavirus (Figures 1A, B). The full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 share a 79.5% sequence identity to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It was reported that, similar to SARS-CoV, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in hosts to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (Lu et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020)). The binding affinity between SSARS-CoV-2 protein and ACE was suggested to be 10 to 60 nM, 10 to 20-fold higher than SSARS-CoV (Lan et al., 2020; Yan R. et al., 2020), but the underlying mechanism remains inconclusive. Variations of crucial residues in the SSARS-CoV-2 protein and their counterpart receptors may contribute to the high transmission efficiency. SARS-CoV-2 produced an evolutionary mutation of K403R compared with SSARS-CoV-2 protein, forming an adjacent RGD motif (Arg-Gly-AsP) at the interaction surface (Luan et al., 2020; Sigrist et al., 2020; Tresoldi et al., 2020; Yan S. et al., 2020). Point mutation of the second codon of “ACA” into “AGA” at site 403 creates an Arg from Thr compared with the sequence in RaTG13, while the counterpart in SARS is “AAG” coding for Lys (Figures 1C, D). Integrin is a transmembrane heterodimeric protein comprising of a and b subunits, many of which recognize the RGD motif displayed on the exposed loops of viral capsid proteins. The RGD motif is the cell attachment site, which can recognize integrin of various epithelial cells to promote cell adhesion and virus internalization by activating transducing pathways involving","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Variations of crucial residues in the SSARS-CoV-2 protein and their counterpart receptors may contribute to the high transmission efficiency, and the underlying mechanism remains inconclusive."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1284,"details":{"paperId":"b1a499a98dd82d0ef47851f42b314dc02e4c1da8","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7118659","MAG":"3011384508","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938","CorpusId":"212729547","PubMed":"32171740"},"title":"New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle are discussed, which could lead to new therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1930,"details":{"paperId":"2ab852e98c9673b1bdbfff3df461b586fd1ec655","externalIds":{"MAG":"3106657028","PubMedCentral":"7685034","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.11.054","CorpusId":"227154405","PubMed":"33279318"},"title":"New vaccine production platforms used in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review highlights key strategies for generating candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and considerations for vaccine development and clinical trials."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6436,"details":{"paperId":"15e2fd4a6ed360707b770b4569f309173d267fa7","externalIds":{"MAG":"3025621438","PubMedCentral":"7219014","DOI":"10.7759/cureus.8069","CorpusId":"218630518","PubMed":"32411566"},"title":"Nifedipine and Amlodipine Are Associated With Improved Mortality and Decreased Risk for Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation in Elderly Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19","abstract":"Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) are typically used agents in the clinical management of hypertension.

A retrospective review was conducted on CCB use in hospitalized patients in search of any difference in outcomes related to specific endpoints: survival to discharge and progression of disease leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The electronic medical records for all patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were at or above the age of 65 and that expired or survived to discharge from a community hospital in Brooklyn, NY, between the start of the public health crisis due to the viral disease up until April 13, 2020, were included. Of the 77 patients that were identified, 18 survived until discharge and 59 expired. Seven patients from the expired group were excluded since they died within one day of presentation to the hospital. Five patients were excluded from the expired group since their age was above that of the eldest patient in the survival group (89 years old).

A drug that targets NOD2 was shown to have potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other flaviviruses, alphaviruses, enteroviruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another drug that inhibits receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), which functions downstream of NOD2, also decreased the replication of these pathogenic RNA viruses. The antiviral effect of this drug was particularly potent against enteroviruses. The broad-spectrum action of nodosome-targeting drugs is mediated in part by the enhancement of the interferon response.

We report the discovery and characterization of small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication that block viral entry by three different mechanisms. The compounds were discovered by screening a chemical library of compounds for blocking of entry of HIV-1 pseudotyped with SARS-CoV surface glycoprotein S (SARS-S) but not that of HIV-1 pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus surface glycoprotein G (VSV-G). Studies on their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 {N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[(Z)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [N-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane.

Because of the time-consuming process to develop new vaccines or antiviral agents, there has been a growing interest in repurposing some existing drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2. Vitamin D is known to be protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and cytokine storm. Recently it has been used as a repurposed drug for the treatment of H5N1 virus-induced lung injury. Circumstantial evidences indicate that people with low level of vitamin D are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Although, vitamin D was suggested to interfere with viral replication, its interaction with any SARS-CoV-2 protein is unexplored yet. Beside this, ivermectin, a well-known anti-parasitic agent, exhibits potent anti-viral activities in vitro against viruses such as HIV-1 and dengue. Very recently, ivermectin has been found to reduce viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. We have analyzed available structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify probable binding partner(s) of vitamin D and ivermectin through knowledge-based docking studies and figured out possible implication of their binding in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observations suggest that the non-structural protein nsp7 possesses a potential site to house 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (VDY) or the active form of Vitamin D, calcitrol. Binding of vitamin D with nsp7 likely to hamper the formation of nsp7-nsp8 complex which is required to bind with RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), nsp12 for optimal function. On the other hand, potential binding site of ivermectin has been identified in the S2 subunit of trimeric spike(S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. We propose that deeply inserted mode of ivermectin binding at three inter-subunit junctions may restrict large scale conformational changes of S2 helices which is necessary for efficient fusion of viral and host membrane.

As primary outcomes, we studied the evolution of SAFI ratio (oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen) in the first 48 hours of treatment and the time to discharge. The results were compared between patients treated and untreated with the study drug through subcohort analyses matched for multiple clinical and prognostic factors, as well as through analysis of non-matched subcohorts, using Cox multivariate models adjusted for prognostic factors. Results There were 239 patients treated with azithromycin. Of these, 29 patients treated with azithromycin could be matched with an equivalent number of control patients. In the analysis of these matched subcohorts, SAFI at 48h had no significant changes associated to the use of azithromycin, though azithromycin treatment was associated with a longer time to discharge (10.0 days vs 6.7 days; log rank: p = 0.039). However, in the unmatched cohorts, the increased hospital stay associated to azithromycin use, was no significant after adjustment using Multivariate Cox regression models: hazard ratio 1.45 (IC95%: 0.88–2.41; p = 0.150). This study is limited by its small sample size and its observational nature; despite the strong pairing of the matched subcohorts and the adjustment of the Cox regression for multiple factors, the results may be affected by residual confusion.

Areas covered: This paper presents old drugs with potential in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro database, adverse effects, and potential toxicities of these drugs are reviewed regarding their feasibility of clinical prescription for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. To obtain convincing recommendations, we referred to opinions from the US National Institute of Health regarding drugs repurposed for COVID-19 therapy. Expert opinion: Although strong evidence of well-designed randomized controlled studies regarding COVID-19 therapy is presently lacking, remdesivir, teicoplanin, hydroxychloroquine (not in combination with azithromycin), and ivermectin might be effective antiviral drugs and are deemed promising candidates for controlling SARS-CoV-2. In addition, tocilizumab might be considered as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome.

Currently, studies describing the neutralization ability of different homologous and heterologous booster vaccination against Omicron are still lacking. In this study, we explored the immunogenicity of COVID-19 breakthrough patients, BBIBP-CorV homologous booster group and BBIBP-CorV/ZF2001 heterologous booster group against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes corresponding to the prototype, Beta, Delta, and the emergent Omicron variant. Notably, at 14 days post two-dose inactivated vaccines, pVNT titre increased to 67.4 GMTs against prototype, 8.85 against Beta and 35.07 against Delta, while neutralization activity against Omicron was below the lower limit of quantitation in 80% of the samples. At day 14 post BBIBP-CorV homologous booster vaccination, GMTs of pVNT significantly increased to 285.6, 215.7, 250.8, 48.73 against prototype, Beta, Delta, and Omicron, while at day 14 post ZF2001 heterologous booster vaccination, GMTs of pVNT significantly increased to 1436.00, 789.6, 1501.00, 95.86, respectively. Post booster vaccination, 100% samples showed positive neutralization activity against Omicron, albeit illustrated a significant reduction (5.86- to 14.98-fold) of pVNT against Omicron compared to prototype at 14 days after the homologous or heterologous vaccine boosters. Overall, our study demonstrates that vaccine-induced immune protection might more likely be escaped by Omicron compared to prototypes and other VOCs.

We seek to determine the association between exposure to ACEI, ARB, and CCB and outcomes in those admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 infection. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 841 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the University of Chicago Medical Center between March 25 and June 22, 2020. Out of these 841, 453 patients had a personal history of hypertension. For the first part, we evaluated primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and ICU admission in hospitalized COVID-19 patients based on their exposure to particular medications regardless of a personal history of hypertension and compared them with those who were not on these medications. For the second part, we evaluated the aforementioned outcomes in 453 patients with a personal history of hypertension based on their medication exposure. Secondary outcomes of length of stay, readmission rate, and new-onset dialysis requirement were also compared across the study groups. Results: Out of 841 patients, 111 (13.19%) were on ACEI/ARB (median age: 66.1, SD 15.4; 52.25% females) and 730 (86.80%) were not on them (median age: 56.6, SD 20.3; 50.14% females), while 277 (32.93%) used CCB (median age: 64.6, SD 15.2; 57.04% females) and 564 (67.06%) did not use CCB (median age: 54.6, SD 21.2; 47.16% females). After adjusting for demographics and covariates, neither ACEI/ARB nor CCB exposure was associated with any effect on mortality, but ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with 42% reduction in risk of ICU admissions (OR 0.58, 95% CI [0.35, 0.95], p value 0.03). In addition, combined use of ACEI/ARB and CCB was associated with statistically significant (45%) reduction in ICU admission (OR 0.55, 95% CI [0.32, 0.94], p value 0.029). Out of 453 patients with a personal history of hypertension, 85 (18.76%) were taking ACEI/ARB (median age 65, SD 15.6; 56.47% females) and 368 (81.24%) were not on ACEI/ARB (median age 62.8, SD 16.4; 54.89% females), while 208 (45.92%) out of 453 were on CCB (median age 65; SD 14.8; 60.1% females) and 245 (54.08%) were not on CCB (median age 61.7, SD 17.3; 51.02% females). In the fully adjusted model in this group, ACEI use was associated with 71% reduction in in-house mortality (OR 0.29, 95% CI [0.09, 0.93], p value 0.03).

Being a potent oxidant, ozone is lethal against most bacteria and viruses found in water, or on surfaces and aerosols. Ozone has also been successfully used to treat several viral diseases such as Ebola and HIV Hepatitis B and C. Using molecular modeling, this study evaluated the reactivity of ozone toward representative key molecules in the structure of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that ozone is able to attack the proteins and lipids of the virus’s spikes and envelope, particularly the amino acids tryptophan, methionine and cysteine, and the fatty acids, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid.

Rapid genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has triggered the scientific community to search for effective vaccines. Collaborative approaches from research institutes and biotech companies have acknowledged the use of viral proteins as potential vaccine candidates against COVID-19. Nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) vaccines are considered the next generation vaccines as they can be rapidly designed to encode any desirable viral sequence including the highly conserved antigen sequences. RNA vaccines being less prone to host genome integration (cons of DNA vaccines) and anti-vector immunity (a compromising factor of viral vectors) offer great potential as front-runners for universal COVID-19 vaccine. The proof of concept for RNA-based vaccines has already been proven in humans, and the prospects for commercialization are very encouraging as well. With the emergence of COVID-19, mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna, Inc. was the first to enter human trials, with the first volunteer receiving the dose within 10 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequencing. The recent interest in mRNA vaccines has been fueled by the state of the art technologies that enhance mRNA stability and improve vaccine delivery. Interestingly, as per the “Draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines” published by the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 29, 2020, seven potential RNA based COVID-19 vaccines are in different stages of clinical trials; of them, two candidates already received emergency use authorization, and another 22 potential candidates are undergoing pre-clinical investigations.

If novel compounds are found, geopolitical and economic variables will determine their introduction to communities. Therefore, finding low-cost and widely accessible drugs for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 would be ideal.A recent study found that ivermectin, an FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug, has inhibitory effects on replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Ivermectin has broad anti-viral activity through inhibition of viral proteins including importin α/β1 heterodimer and integrase protein2. Caly and colleagues reported that the addition of ivermectin at a concentration of 5 micromolar (μM) (twice the reported IC50) to Vero-hSLAM cells, 2 hours post infection with SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a reduction in the viral RNA load by 99.98% at 48 hours1. The authors suggested that this drug could reduce the viral load in infected patients, with potential effect on disease progression and spread.While the findings by Caly and colleagues provide some promise, there is no evidence that the 5 μM concentration of ivermectin used by Caly and colleagues in their in vitro SARS-CoV-2 experiment, can be achieved in vivo . The pharmacokinetics of ivermectin in humans is well described (Figure 1)3-5, and even with the highest reported dose of approximately 1700 µg/kg (i.e. 8.5 times the FDA-approved dose of 200 μg/kg), the maximum plasma concentration was only 0.28 µM5. This is 18 times lower than the concentration required to reduce viral replication of SARS-CoV-2in vitro . Ivermectin accumulation in tissues is mild and would not be sufficient to achieve the antiviral effect with conventional doses6. Although high doses of ivermectin in adults or children are well tolerated5,7, the clinical effects of ivermectin at a concentration of 5 μM range are unknown and may be associated with toxicity. Consequently, ivermectin has in vitroactivity against SARS-CoV-2 but this effect is unlikely to be observedin vivo using current dosing.Amidst fear of the pandemic, the public and some physicians are now using ivermectin off-label for prophylaxis or as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19. Because ivermectin is only commercially available as a 3 or 6 mg tablets or a 6 mg/ml oral suspension, in order to administer a high dose, some people may experiment with more concentrated veterinary formulations. These actions are not based on clinical trials and have motivated cautionary statements from institutions such as the FDA against the use of pharmaceutical formulations of ivermectin intended for animals as therapeutics in humans 8.Potential avenues for further investigation into repurposing ivermectin for SARS-CoV-2 may be to: (i) develop an inhaled formulation to efficiently deliver a high local concentration in the lung, whilst minimizing systemic exposure; and (ii) evaluate more potent ivermectin analogs (e.g. doramectin) which may also inhibit SARS-CoV-2. These are areas for research – clearly, further studies are needed before ivermectin can be used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. As recently discussed in BJCP, this highlights the critical need to consider pharmacological principles to guide in vitro testing when repurposing old drugs for therapeutic use against COVID-199.","publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"There is no evidence that the 5 μM concentration of ivermectin used by Caly and colleagues in their in vitro SARS-CoV-2 experiment, can be achieved in vivo, and this highlights the critical need to consider pharmacological principles to guide in vitro testing when repurposing old drugs for therapeutic use against COVID-199."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3477,"details":{"paperId":"0ab382e826228ce5da4d98a2591561020d6946b2","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7337789","MAG":"3038886571","DOI":"10.1093/jac/dkaa239","CorpusId":"220285380","PubMed":"32607555"},"title":"Pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in two critically ill patients who recovered from COVID-19","abstract":"Abstract Background Remdesivir is a prodrug of the nucleoside analogue GS-441524 and is under evaluation for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Objectives To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in plasma, bronchoalveolar aspirate (BAS) and CSF in two critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods Remdesivir was administered at 200 mg loading dose on the first day followed by 12 days of 100 mg in two critically ill patients.

In this regard, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, a member of the PPAR transcription factor family, could represent a potential target. Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-γ also represses the inflammatory process. Similarly, the PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia.

These comorbidities have adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients that might result from pharmacotherapy. Increasing ACE2 could potentially increase the risk of infection, severity or mortality in COVID-19 or it might be protective as it forms angiotensin-(1–7) which exhibits anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidative effects and prevents diabetes- and/or hypertension-induced end-organ damage.

Currently, no therapeutic drug or vaccine exists to treat COVID-19. Due to the time taking process of new drug development, drug repurposing might be the only viable solution to tackle COVID-19. RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzes SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication and hence, is an obvious target for antiviral drug design. Interestingly, several plant-derived polyphenols effectively inhibit the RdRp of other RNA viruses. More importantly, polyphenols have been used as dietary supplementations for a long time and played beneficial roles in immune homeostasis. We were curious to study the binding of polyphenols with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their potential to treat COVID-19. Herein, we made a library of polyphenols that have shown substantial therapeutic effects against various diseases. They were successfully docked in the catalytic pocket of RdRp. The investigation reveals that EGCG, theaflavin (TF1), theaflavin-3’-O-gallate (TF2a), theaflavin-3’-gallate (TF2b), theaflavin 3,3'-digallate (TF3), hesperidin, quercetagetin, and myricetin strongly bind to the active site of RdRp. Further, a 150-ns molecular dynamic simulation revealed that EGCG, TF2a, TF2b, TF3 result in highly stable bound conformations with RdRp. The binding free energy components calculated by the MM-PBSA also confirm the stability of the complexes.

Here, we isolated monoclonal antibodies from three convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using a SARS-CoV-2 stabilized prefusion spike protein. These antibodies had low levels of somatic hypermutation and showed a strong enrichment in VH1-69, VH3-30-3, and VH1-24 gene usage. A subset of the antibodies was able to potently inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection at a concentration as low as 0.007 micrograms per milliliter. Competition and electron microscopy studies illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains multiple distinct antigenic sites, including several receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes as well as non-RBD epitopes. In addition to providing guidance for vaccine design, the antibodies described here are promising candidates for COVID-19 treatment and prevention.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that the patients had strong immune responses against the viral spike protein, a complex that binds to receptors on the host cell, and monoclonal antibodies isolated here are promising candidates for COVID-19 treatment and prevention."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6081,"details":{"paperId":"b6d0aba52498acde1ba574b4331352a68f6ca395","externalIds":{"MAG":"3044596219","PubMedCentral":"7432953","DOI":"10.3390/ijms21155224","CorpusId":"220841103","PubMed":"32718020"},"title":"Potential Anti-COVID-19 Therapeutics that Block the Early Stage of the Viral Life Cycle: Structures, Mechanisms, and Clinical Trials","abstract":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is being caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Nevertheless, researchers have swiftly responded to the pandemic by advancing old and new potential therapeutics into clinical trials. In this review, we summarize potential anti-COVID-19 therapeutics that block the early stage of the viral life cycle. The review presents the structures, mechanisms, and reported results of clinical trials of potential therapeutics that have been listed in clinicaltrials.gov.

The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules and macromolecules of sulfated polysaccharides, polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. The potential therapeutics target viral and/or host proteins or processes that facilitate the early stage of the viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral spike protein, the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the host transmembrane protease serine 2, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis process.

Herculean efforts to rapidly design and produce vaccines and other antiviral interventions are ongoing. However, newly evolving viral mutations, the prospect of only temporary immunity, and a long path to regulatory approval pose significant challenges and call for a common, readily available, and inexpensive treatment. Strategic drug repurposing combined with rapid testing of established molecular targets could provide a pause in disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 shares extensive structural and functional conservation with SARS-CoV-1, including engagement of the same host cell receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) localized in cholesterol-rich microdomains. These lipid-enveloped viruses encounter the endosomal/lysosomal host compartment in a critical step of infection and maturation. Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease is a rare monogenic neurodegenerative disease caused by deficient efflux of lipids from the late endosome/lysosome (LE/L). The NP-C disease-causing gene (NPC1) has been strongly associated with viral infection, both as a filovirus receptor (e.g., Ebola) and through LE/L lipid trafficking. This suggests that NPC1 inhibitors or NP-C disease mimetics could serve as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Fortunately, there are such clinically approved molecules that elicit antiviral activity in preclinical studies, without causing NP-C disease.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has taken humanity off guard. Following an outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002, and MERS-CoV about 10 years later, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in less than 20 years to cross the species barrier and start spreading by human-to-human transmission. It is the most infectious of the three, currently causing the COVID-19 pandemic. No treatment has been approved for COVID-19. We previously proposed targets that can serve as binding sites for antiviral drugs for multiple coronaviruses, and here we set out to find current drugs that can be repurposed as COVID-19 therapeutics. Aim. To identify drugs against COVID-19, we performed an in silico virtual screen with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a critical enzyme for coronavirus replication. Methodology. Initially, no RdRP structure of SARS-CoV-2 was available. We performed basic sequence and structural analysis to determine if RdRP from SARS-CoV was a suitable replacement. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to generate multiple starting conformations that were used for the in silico virtual screen. During this work, a structure of RdRP from SARS-CoV-2 became available and was also included in the in silico virtual screen. Results. The virtual screen identified several drugs predicted to bind in the conserved RNA tunnel of RdRP, where many of the proposed targets were located. Among these candidates, quinupristin is particularly interesting because it is expected to bind across the RNA tunnel, blocking access from both sides and suggesting that it has the potential to arrest viral replication by preventing viral RNA synthesis. Quinupristin is an antibiotic that has been in clinical use for two decades and is known to cause relatively minor side effects. Conclusion. Quinupristin represents a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic. At present, we have no evidence that this drug is effective against SARS-CoV-2 but expect that the biomedical community will expeditiously follow up on our in silico findings.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Quinupristin is particularly interesting because it is expected to bind across the RNA tunnel, blocking access from both sides and suggesting that it has the potential to arrest viral replication by preventing viral RNA synthesis."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1142,"details":{"paperId":"00d198fc0e30a3aab28a545061970cfb82f839d3","externalIds":{"MAG":"3113166651","PubMedCentral":"7724992","DOI":"10.1016/j.drudis.2020.12.005","CorpusId":"228076565","PubMed":"33309533"},"title":"Potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review focusses on the recent developments in the search for small-molecule inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), with the recent reporting of the X-ray crystal structure of the Sars-Cov-2 Mpro."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5522,"details":{"paperId":"5320e8ca9e65dc396440a8cc878f102a21e63da7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2119146932","DOI":"10.1586/14787210.4.2.291","CorpusId":"86300112"},"title":"Potential antivirals and antiviral strategies against SARS coronavirus infections","abstract":"There are a number of antivirals as well as antiviral strategies that could be envisaged to prevent or treat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (or similar) coronavirus (CoV) infections.

The current situation demands an effective therapeutic strategy to control the disease using drugs that are approved, or by inventing new ones. The present study examines the possible repurposing of existing anti-viral protease inhibitor drugs. For this, the structural features of the viral spike protein, the substrate for host cell protease and main protease of the available SARS CoV-2 isolates were established by comparing with related viruses for which antiviral drugs are effective. The results showed 97% sequence similarity among SARS and SARS-CoV-2 main protease and has same cleavage site positions and ACE2 receptor binding region as in the SARS–CoV spike protein. Though both are N-glycosylated, unlike SARS-CoV, human SARS-CoV-2 S-protein was O-glycosylated as well. Molecular docking studies were done to explore the role of FDA approved protease inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 replication. The results indicated that, Ritonavir has the highest potency to block SARS-CoV-2 main protease and human TMPRSS2, a host cell factor that aids viral infection. Other drugs such as Indinavir and Atazanavir also showed favourable binding with Cathepsin B/L that helped viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Further molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations confirmed the stability of protein-drug complexes. These results suggest that protease inhibitors particularly Ritonavir, either alone or in combination with other drugs such as Atazanavir, have the potential to treat COVID 19.

Lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory failure. Methods: Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19. We performed drug repositioning analysis to identify drug candidates that reverse gene expression pattern in L1000 lung cell line HCC515 treated with ACE2 inhibitor. We confirmed these drug candidates by similar bioinformatics analysis using lung tissues from patients deceased from COVID-19. We further investigated deregulated genes and pathways related to lung injury, as well as the gene-pathway-drug candidate relationships. Results: We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating lung injuries in COVID-19. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that 12 significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues. These include signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and chemokine signaling pathways. All 12 pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares 11 of 12 pathways with COL-3 and common target genes such as RHOA. It also uniquely targets other genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14.

The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved.

By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China.

The viral outbreak started in late 2019 and rapidly became a serious health threat to the global population. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Several therapeutic options have been adopted to prevent the spread of the virus. Although vaccines have been developed, antivirals are still needed to combat the infection of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, and its genome encodes polyproteins that can be processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. Maturation of viral proteins requires cleavages by proteases. Therefore, the main protease (3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or Mpro) encoded by the viral genome is an attractive drug target because it plays an important role in cleaving viral polyproteins into functional proteins. Inhibiting this enzyme is an efficient strategy to block viral replication. Structural studies provide valuable insight into the function of this protease and structural basis for rational inhibitor design. In this review, we describe structural studies on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.

The authors vaccinated nonhuman primates with soluble prefusion-stabilized spike trimers (preS dTM) plus the adjuvant AS03, an oil-in-water emulsion. The authors found that preS dTM plus AS03 induced robust antibody and cellular immune responses that protected nonhuman primates from disease when challenged with SARS-CoV-2.

Moreover, passive transfer of vaccine-induced IgG to hamsters mediated protection from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Science, this issue p. 1110 In vivo efficacy of the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail is evaluated in the rhesus macaque and golden hamster models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. An urgent global quest for effective therapies to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is ongoing. We previously described REGN-COV2, a cocktail of two potent neutralizing antibodies (REGN10987 and REGN10933) that targets nonoverlapping epitopes on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. In this report, we evaluate the in vivo efficacy of this antibody cocktail in both rhesus macaques, which may model mild disease, and golden hamsters, which may model more severe disease.

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Methods: Healthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation. Results: In both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera.

The rapid development of promising therapeutic strategies against COVID‐19 is keenly anticipated. Family Coronaviridae comprises positive, single‐stranded RNA viruses that use RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) for viral replication and transcription. As the RdRP of viruses in this family and others plays a pivotal role in infection, it is a promising therapeutic target for developing antiviral agents against them. A critical genetic driver for many cancers is the catalytic subunit of telomerase: human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), identified initially as an RNA‐dependent DNA polymerase. However, even though hTERT is a DNA polymerase, it has phylogenetic and structural similarities to viral RdRPs. Researchers worldwide, including the authors of this review, are engaged in developing therapeutic strategies targeting hTERT. We have published a series of papers reporting that hTERT has RdRP activity and that this RdRP activity in hTERT is essential for tumor formation.

The emergence of COVID-19 in March 2020 challenged Zimbabwe to mount a response with limited medical facilities and therapeutic options. Ivermectin (IVM) had by then been safely used to treat a variety of human diseases affecting millions, as noted by the Nobel Committee in awarding its 2015 prize for medicine. Based upon early clinical indications of efficacy against COVID-19, IVM-based combination treatments were deployed to treat this infection in Zimbabwe.Methods. Data were retrospectively analyzed for 34 severe COVID-19 patients treated with IVM-based combination therapy between August 2020 and May 2021, for whom pre- and post-treatment SpO2 values were all recorded on room air. Mortality and deterioration outcomes were also analyzed for a larger set of 92 severe COVID-19 patients receiving IVM-based treatment.Results: For the 34-patient SpO2 tracking series, all but two patients had significantly increased SpO2 values after the first IVM dose, and all patients recovered. Mean increases in SpO2 as percentages of full normalization to SpO2=97 were 55.1% at +12 hours and 62.3% at +24 hours post-treatment. These results paralleled similar sharp increases in SpO2, all on room air, for a series of 24 RT-qPCR confirmed, mostly severe COVID-19 patients in the USA (California) who were given IVM combination treatment, all of whom recovered. For 19 of those patients having SpO2 ≤ 90 prior to IVM, the mean SpO2 normalization at +24 hours post-treatment was 65.2% as calculated from the SpO2 values reported. For our larger series of 92 severe COVID-19 patients in Zimbabwe, median age 53, only two died and two more deteriorated prior to recovery, far less than a predicted 7 deaths and 17 deteriorations for the demographics and risk factors of these patients.Conclusions. The rapid, marked increases in SpO2 for both the Zimbabwe and California patients stand in sharp contrast to the decline in SpO2 and associated pulmonary function following onset of moderate or severe COVID-19 symptoms under standard care. These rapid SpO2 increases and low mortality rates support extended deployment of IVM treatment for COVID-19, complementary to immunizations for prevention.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2856,"details":{"paperId":"18b70a5fe8bbc5b5813d1a6d50246a7021e52391","externalIds":{"MAG":"3040899749","DOI":"10.1038/s41591-020-0998-x","CorpusId":"220440187","PubMed":"32651581"},"title":"Rapid isolation and profiling of a diverse panel of human monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A platform for rapid antibody discovery enabled the isolation of hundreds of human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the prioritization of potent antibody candidates for clinical trials in patients with COVID-19, and demonstrates the speed and robustness of advanced antibody discovery platforms."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4508,"details":{"paperId":"43e5fc73bb10e64d621701bda5c69c0f5f4aa808","externalIds":{"MAG":"3022916237","DOI":"10.1126/science.abb9332","CorpusId":"218563395","PubMed":"32385101"},"title":"Rapid repurposing of drugs for COVID-19","abstract":"The emergence of a new coronaviral respiratory disease calls for repurposing existing drugs In late fall 2019, a novel acute respiratory disease, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China.

At 9 hours, ascites and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected for the evaluation of capillary leakage (Evans blue extravasation). Pancreas and lung were excised for histologic features, myeloperoxidase, and trypsinogen activation peptide. Twenty-four hour survival was evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly the intravenous infusion of nafamostat significantly reduced myeloperoxidase (11.7 +/- 2.3 vs 18.3 +/- 1.8 mU/mg; P <.05) and capillary leakage in lungs (Evans blue dye, 1.6 +/- 0.3 vs 2.6 +/- 0.3; P <.05). Only intra-arterial infusion of nafamostat significantly diminished capillary peritoneal leakage (Evans blue dye, 3.6 +/- 0.9 vs 9.4 +/- 0.4; P <.01). Typsinogen activation peptide levels were significantly reduced in all groups, but only intra-arterial infusion did so to baseline. Histologic inflammation in the pancreas was most significantly reduced after intra-arterial infusion (0.92 +/- 0.08 vs 2.91 +/- 0.06; P <.05). No form of protease inhibition reduced mortality rates.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe effects of protease inhibition depend on the route of administration. Nafamostat has maximal effects on the pancreas and peritoneal capillary leakage when delivered by way of local intra-arterial infusion, and shows a greater reduction of lung leukocyte infiltration and capillary leakage by the intravenous route. Nafamostat is more effective than gabexate.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Nafamostat has maximal effects on the pancreas and peritoneal capillary leaking when delivered by way of local intra-arterial infusion, and shows a greater reduction of lung leukocyte infiltration and capillary leakage by the intravenous route."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":656,"details":{"paperId":"fba2fa6b3d4b0f33330455d0e96b5d956207614d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3086446357","PubMedCentral":"7492151","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.09.012","CorpusId":"221711771","PubMed":"32946859"},"title":"Relation of Statin Use Prior to Admission to Severity and Recovery Among COVID-19 Inpatients","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In conclusion, statin use during the 30 days prior to admission for COVID-19 was associated with a lower risk of developing severe CO VID-19, and a faster time to recovery among patients without severe disease."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":954,"details":{"paperId":"5ca7891b8a4bfe573c4f871f9a1cbb28aa7a9230","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7340027","MAG":"3041968020","DOI":"10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940","CorpusId":"220381912","PubMed":"32668216"},"title":"Remdesivir Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in Human Lung Cells and Chimeric SARS-CoV Expressing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA Polymerase in Mice","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Remdesivir (RDV) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures and in mice infected with chimeric virus, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2307,"details":{"paperId":"91426498d33dc971902c00200aed68d4910d85c0","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7875336","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01929","CorpusId":"231762980","PubMed":"33523654"},"title":"Remdesivir Metabolite GS-441524 Effectively Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Mouse Models","abstract":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic due to the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

SUMMARY Patients and physicians worldwide are facing tremendous health care hazards that are caused by the ongoing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is the first approved treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a novel nucleoside analog with a broad antiviral activity spectrum among RNA viruses, including ebolavirus (EBOV) and the respiratory pathogens Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. First described in 2016, the drug was derived from an antiviral library of small molecules intended to target emerging pathogenic RNA viruses. In vivo, remdesivir showed therapeutic and prophylactic effects in animal models of EBOV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the substance failed in a clinical trial on ebolavirus disease (EVD), where it was inferior to investigational monoclonal antibodies in an interim analysis. As there was no placebo control in this study, no conclusions on its efficacy in EVD can be made. In contrast, data from a placebo-controlled trial show beneficial effects for patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir reduces the time to recovery of hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen and may have a positive impact on mortality outcomes while having a favorable safety profile. Although this is an important milestone in the fight against COVID-19, approval of this drug will not be sufficient to solve the public health issues caused by the ongoing pandemic. Further scientific efforts are needed to evaluate the full potential of nucleoside analogs as treatment or prophylaxis of viral respiratory infections and to develop effective antivirals that are orally bioavailable.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Remdesivir reduces the time to recovery of hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen and may have a positive impact on mortality outcomes while having a favorable safety profile, and approval of this drug will not be sufficient to solve the public health issues caused by the ongoing pandemic."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":681,"details":{"paperId":"1e8874fb92f6e4e828b2b4e7521396f1b1132a6c","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7151495","MAG":"3015472194","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793","CorpusId":"215724623","PubMed":"32283108"},"title":"Remdesivir and SARS-CoV-2: Structural requirements at both nsp12 RdRp and nsp14 Exonuclease active-sites","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A promising NA candidate is mapped to the nucleoside active site of SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision, and Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1901,"details":{"paperId":"2c580f8248e9fef2a549047e3e354b0ccf78dade","externalIds":{"MAG":"3026519293","PubMedCentral":"7129391","DOI":"10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101615","CorpusId":"212629372","PubMed":"32145386"},"title":"Remdesivir as a possible therapeutic option for the COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Editorial","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This is a PDF file of an article that has undergone enhancements after acceptance, such as the addition of a cover page and metadata, and formatting for readability, but it is not yet the definitive version of record."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2053,"details":{"paperId":"8989ac0b6d0f0500226f6a57fd3c5d859a2fbbfc","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7190306","MAG":"3017579918","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31023-0","CorpusId":"216642405","PubMed":"32423580"},"title":"Remdesivir for COVID-19: challenges of underpowered studies","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5303,"details":{"paperId":"afa967aa60c6a1b4d45be72d567194ed2b48cef1","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1208/s12248-020-00459-8","CorpusId":"255565306"},"title":"Remdesivir for Treatment of COVID-19: Combination of Pulmonary and IV Administration May Offer Aditional Benefit","abstract":"Remdesivir is one of the most promising drugs to treat COVID-19 based on the following facts: remdesivir has a broad-spectrum antiviral mechanism of action; it demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and in vivo efficacy in animal models against the similar coronavirus MERS-CoV; its safety profile has been tested in Ebola patients and in compassionate use in COVID-19 patients.

Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV). RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action. Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the nonstructural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA. Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i+3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps. A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP. In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2′-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed.

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The present article discusses this concept. ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.

METHODS Study drugs were Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir (fixed-dose combination with Ritonavir) and Interferon-{beta}1a (mainly subcutaneous; initially with Lopinavir, later not). COVID-19 inpatients were randomized equally between whichever study drugs were locally available and open control (up to 5 options: 4 active and local standard-of-care). The intent-to-treat primary analyses are of in-hospital mortality in the 4 pairwise comparisons of each study drug vs its controls (concurrently allocated the same management without that drug, despite availability). Kaplan-Meier 28-day risks are unstratified; log-rank death rate ratios (RRs) are stratified for age and ventilation at entry. RESULTS In 405 hospitals in 30 countries 11,266 adults were randomized, with 2750 allocated Remdesivir, 954 Hydroxychloroquine, 1411 Lopinavir, 651 Interferon plus Lopinavir, 1412 only Interferon, and 4088 no study drug. Compliance was 94-96% midway through treatment, with 2-6% crossover. 1253 deaths were reported (at median day 8, IQR 4-14). Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 12% (39% if already ventilated at randomization, 10% otherwise). Death rate ratios (with 95% CIs and numbers dead/randomized, each drug vs its control) were: Remdesivir RR=0.95 (0.81-1.11, p=0.50; 301/2743 active vs 303/2708 control), Hydroxychloroquine RR=1.19 (0.89-1.59, p=0.23; 104/947 vs 84/906), Lopinavir RR=1.00 (0.79-1.25, p=0.97; 148/1399 vs 146/1372) and Interferon RR=1.16 (0.96-1.39, p=0.11; 243/2050 vs 216/2050). No study drug definitely reduced mortality (in unventilated patients or any other subgroup of entry characteristics), initiation of ventilation or hospitalisation duration. CONCLUSIONS These Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay.

To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm.

So far, no definitive vaccine or drug has been developed to cure Covid-19 disease, since many important aspects about Covid-19 such as pathogenesis and proliferation pathways are still unclear. It was proven that human ACE2 is the main receptor for the entry of Covid-19 into lower respiratory tract epithelial cells through interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Based on this observation, it is expected that the virus infection can be inhibited if protein-protein interaction is prevented. In this study, using structure-based virtual screening of FDA databases, several lead drugs were discovered based on the ACE2-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Then, binding affinity, binding modes, critical interactions, and pharmaceutical properties of the lead drugs were evaluated.

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in the replication and propagation of the virus in the host cells. Inhibiting the protease blocks the replication of the virus; therefore it is considered as an attractive therapeutic target. Here we describe the screening of the DrugBank database, a public repository for small molecule therapeutics, to identify approved or experimental phase drugs that can be repurposed against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The initial screening was performed on more than 13,000 drug entries in the target database using an energy optimised pharmacophore hypothesis AARRR. A sub-set of the molecules selected based on the fitness score was further screened using molecular docking by sequentially filtering the molecules through the high throughput virtual screening, extra precision and standard precision docking modalities. The best hits were subjected to binding free energy estimation using the MM-GBSA method. Approved drugs viz, Cobicistat, Larotrectinib and Simeprevir were identified as potential candidates for repurposing. Drugs in the discovery phase identified as inhibitors include the known cysteine protease inhibitors, Calpain inhibitor IV and an experimental cathepsin F inhibitor.

As of 22nd September 2020, more than 30,949,804 confirmed cases and 959,116 deaths have been reported worldwide (WHO, 2020). COVID-19 bears several pathological hallmarks including fever, breathing difficulty, bilateral lung infiltration, and death in the most extreme cases (Huang et al., 2020). Several anti-viral drugs have been used to target the SARS-CoV-2 infection. These drugs include remdesivir, ribavirin, penciclovir, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine (Wang, Cao, et al., 2020). However, most of these medicines have limited efficacy to reduce the severity and, particularly the mortality of COVID-19 patients. In addition, some of them have serious side effects (Cao et al., 2020; Wang, Zhang, et al., 2020). The shortcomings of current medicines lead scientists and physicians to continuously look up for better remedies for COVID-19. Resveratrol is a promising one of those remedies. Resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene, RES) is a phenolic compound produced by various members of spermatophytes such as grapes, mulberry, and peanuts. It displays potential effects to suppress replication of several viruses including dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), as well as influenza virus (Mohd, Zainal, Tan, & Sazaly, 2019; Paemanee, Hitakarun, Roytrakul, & Duncan, 2018). Particularly, RES has the capacity to significantly inhibit MERS-CoV infection and increases the viability of cells infected by this virus (Lin et al., 2017). Based on these observations, we have initiated a study to test whether RES also inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2. This study has been approved by the ethics committees from Shenzhen Third People's Hospital and strictly follows the approved protocol. All procedures involving SARS-CoV-2 infection were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. First of all, the dose-responsive study of RES (from 1.56 to 200 μM) was performed to assess whether RES exhibits cytotoxicity on Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81). The results showed that cell viability of Vero cells remained above 90 and 80% with the RES at concentrations of 100 and 200 μM for 48 hr, respectively (Figure 1a). The results suggested that RES had little cytotoxicity to Vero cells even at such high concentrations which is consistent with previous reports on various other cell types including oocytes or embryos (Li et al., 2016). To test the effects of RES on SARSCoV-2 replication, the Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-003/2020 strain virus GISAID access number: EPI_ISL_406594) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and treated with different concentrations of RES. The viral replication was analyzed at 48 hr postinfection with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence assay (Figure 1b,c). The results showed that RES significantly inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) of 4.48 μM. To examine the time window of RES on SARS-CoV-2 infection, RES was incubated with cells before and/or after their infection and the time-of-addition assay was used to evaluate the effects described by Wang, Cao, et al. (2020). Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from the harvested supernatants and then qRT-PCR was performed. The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA copy number was compared between the mock-treated and RES-treated cells. The results showed that the inhibitory rate for SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells pre-treated with RES 50 μM for 2 hr was less than 20%; however, inhibitory rate in cells treated with RES after virus infection was excessive at 98% which was similar to the full time treatment (pre and after treatment together). The results indicate that the inhibitory effects of RES on SARS-CoV-2 replication have a strong presence after the viruses are inoculated into the culture medium. It has been reported that RES possesses highly stable conformation to the viral S protein-ACE2 receptor complex (Wahedi, Ahmad, & Abbasi, 2020). Interestingly, when cells were co-incubated with virus and RES for 1 hr and then the RES was removed for additional 48 hr incubation, the inhibitory rate was still at around 64% (Figure 1d). This suggests that RES has a blocking capacity to the viral entry into cells. These novel data support the potential utility of RES on SARS-CoV-2 infection. RES activates intracellular SIRT1 signaling which plays an important role in the resistance of viral infection (Côté et al., 2015). Therefore, a SIRT1 antagonist, Sirtinol, and a SIRT1 activator, SRT 1720, were selected to test whether RES inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection via SIRT1 pathway. The results showed that Sirtinol indeed promoted the replication of SARS-CoV-2 while SRT 1720 seemed to have little effect on virus replication (Figure 1e). Judging from the effect of Sirtinol on replication of SARS-CoV-2, additional SIRT1 activators should be used to further explore the mechanism. RES has been reported to decrease the production of nitricoxide in tissue, and thereby to reduce the tissue inflammatory reaction. RES also acts as an antioxidant to scavenger-free radicals to restrain tumor growth and even age-related diseases.

Early anecdotal reports and limited in vitro data led to the significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and to lesser extent chloroquine (CQ), for many patients with this disease. As an increasing number of patients with COVID‐19 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high‐quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease. Moreover, these agents have the potential to cause harm, including a broad range of adverse events including serious cardiac side effects when combined with other agents. In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto‐immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in patients with COVID‐19, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection. Specifically, the impact of HCQ on cytokine production and suppression of antigen presentation may have immunologic consequences that hamper innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses for patients with COVID‐19. Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections. Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID‐19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease.

We studied whether patients prescribed these drugs had altered risks of contracting severe COVID-19 disease and receiving associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods This was a prospective cohort study using routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England with 8.28 million participants aged 20–99 years. We used Cox proportional hazards models to derive adjusted HRs for exposure to ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs adjusted for sociodemographic factors, concurrent medications and geographical region. The primary outcomes were: (a) COVID-19 RT-PCR diagnosed disease and (b) COVID-19 disease resulting in ICU care. Findings Of 19 486 patients who had COVID-19 disease, 1286 received ICU care. ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 disease (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.74) but no increased risk of ICU care (adjusted HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.06) after adjusting for a wide range of confounders. Adjusted HRs for ARBs were 0.63 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.67) for COVID-19 disease and 1.02 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.25) for ICU care. There were significant interactions between ethnicity and ACE inhibitors and ARBs for COVID-19 disease. The risk of COVID-19 disease associated with ACE inhibitors was higher in Caribbean (adjusted HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28) and Black African (adjusted HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.59) groups than the white group (adjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.70). A higher risk of COVID-19 with ARBs was seen for Black African (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.58) than the white (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.62) group. Interpretation ACE inhibitors and ARBs are associated with reduced risks of COVID-19 disease after adjusting for a wide range of variables. Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs are associated with significantly increased risks of receiving ICU care.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN). Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of Remdesivir. We found that Remdesivir’s 1’-cyano group of possesses the dual role of inhibiting nucleotide addition and proofreading. The presence of its polar 1’-cyano group at an upstream site in RdRp causes instability and hampers RdRp translocation. This leads to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension, which may also subsequently reduce the likelihood for Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on the 3’-terminal nucleotide. In addition, our simulations suggest that Remdesivir’s 1’-cyano group can also disrupt the cleavage active site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduced cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible molecular mechanisms on how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication and may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Simulations suggest that Remdesivir’s 1’-cyano group can also disrupt the cleavage active site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduced cleavage efficiency."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6039,"details":{"paperId":"b96151a9c560b026489f2da8d2500bceb82206c9","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8067447","DOI":"10.3390/cells10040821","CorpusId":"233389068","PubMed":"33917481"},"title":"Role of Structural and Non-Structural Proteins and Therapeutic Targets of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19","abstract":"Coronavirus belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, comprising single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (+ ssRNA) of around 26 to 32 kilobases, and has been known to cause infection to a myriad of mammalian hosts, such as humans, cats, bats, civets, dogs, and camels with varied consequences in terms of death and debilitation. Strikingly, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and found to be the causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), shows 88% of sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, 79% with SARS-CoV and 50% with MERS-CoV, respectively. Despite key amino acid residual variability, there is an incredible structural similarity between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. During infection, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV displays 10–20 times greater affinity for its cognate host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading proteolytic cleavage of S protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Following cellular entry, the ORF-1a and ORF-1ab, located downstream to 5′ end of + ssRNA genome, undergo translation, thereby forming two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins, following protease-induced cleavage and molecular assembly, form functional viral RNA polymerase, also referred to as replicase. Thereafter, uninterrupted orchestrated replication-transcription molecular events lead to the synthesis of multiple nested sets of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), which are finally translated to several structural and accessory proteins participating in structure formation and various molecular functions of virus, respectively. These multiple structural proteins assemble and encapsulate genomic RNA (gRNA), resulting in numerous viral progenies, which eventually exit the host cell, and spread infection to rest of the body.

It is shown that Remdesivir, a nucleoside drug that was originally invented for the Ebola virus, is effective in suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Galidesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), and EIDD-2801 (a prodrug of EIDD-1931) were also found to be effective against COVID-19. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not yet fully understood. For example, in some experimental studies, these drugs were proposed to act as a RNA-chain terminator, while in other studies, these were proposed to induce base-pair mutations above the error catastrophe limit to stall the replication of the viral RNA. To understand the mutagenic effects of these drugs, the role of different tautomers in their base-pairing abilities is studied here in detail by employing a reliable dispersion-corrected density functional theoretic method. It is found that Remdesivir and Galidesivir can adopt both amino and imino tautomeric conformations to base-pair with RNA bases. While the insertions of G and U are preferred against the amino tautomers of these drugs, the insertion of C is mainly possible against the imino tautomers. However, although Favipiravir and Ribavirin can make stable base pair interactions by using their keto and enol tautomers, the formation of the latter pairs would be less probable due to the endothermic nature of the products. Interestingly, the insertions of all of the RNA bases are found to be possible against the keto tautomer of Favipiravir, while the keto tautomer of Ribavirin has a clear preference for G. Remarkably, due to the negligible difference in the stability of EIDD-2801 and EIDD-1931, these tautomers would coexist in the biological environment. The insertion of G is found to be preferred against EIDD-1931 and the incorporations of U, A, and G are preferred opposite EIDD-2801. These findings suggest that base-pair mutations are the main causes of the antiviral properties of these drugs.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that Remdesivir, a nucleoside drug that was originally invented for the Ebola virus, is effective in suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1342,"details":{"paperId":"2f6bf276e44d0b520838e34fedc8a03adb752936","externalIds":{"MAG":"3095251247","PubMedCentral":"7831863","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.069","CorpusId":"226232644","PubMed":"33130203"},"title":"Role of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Intentions are provided on benefits of initiating an early antiviral therapy with special focus on favipiravir, its pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, in vitro, clinical data, and inclusion in the treatment protocols of COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4885,"details":{"paperId":"0a0fd412bdd34c41e98b47d69a4343bdd090bbab","externalIds":{"MAG":"2150120685","DOI":"10.1136/thorax.2003.012658","CorpusId":"40409310","PubMed":"14985565"},"title":"Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings","abstract":"Background: The clinical response of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin was examined after establishing the in vitro antiviral susceptibility of the SARS associated coronavirus to a panel of antiviral agents.

Cumulative clinical and laboratory evidence suggest that a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 may develop a cytokine storm syndrome during the course of the disease, with severe respiratory impairment requiring ventilatory support. One field of research nowadays is to identify and treat viral-induced hyperinflammation with drugs used in other clinical conditions characterized by an hyperinflammation status. These drugs might help to reduce COVID19 mortality. Methods: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, has been successfully used to treat severe immune-mediated diseases, such as graft vs. host disease and Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We used ruxolitinib in 18 patients with clinically progressive COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a primary endpoint to rapidly reduce the degree of respiratory impairment and as a secondary endpoint to rapidly restore the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, as an evaluation of clinical status, and monitoring of drug related Adverse Events. Parameters of inflammation responses and organ functions were assessed and monitored. The treatment plan was ruxolitinib 20 mg bid for the first 48 h and subsequent two-step de-escalation at 10 mg bid and 5 mg bid for a maximum of 14 days of treatment. Results: Our data collection shows a rapid clinical response with no evolution from non-invasive ventilation to mechanical ventilation in 16/18 patients and no response in two patients (overall response rate—ORR 89%). Already after 48 h of ruxolitinib treatment 16/18 patients showed evident clinical improvement, and after 7 days of treatment 11/18 patients showed fully recovered respiratory function (pO2 > 98% in spontaneous breathing), 4/18 patients had minimal oxygen requirement (2–4 L/m), 1/18 patient showed stable disease, and 2/18 patient showed progressive disease. After 14 days, 16/18 patients showed complete recovery of respiratory function (ORR 89%). Compliance to ruxolitinib planned treatment was 100% and no serious adverse event was recorded. In our case series of 18 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of ruxolitinib resulted in a clinical improvement that concurred to modify the standard course of disease.

S100A12 levels were not correlated to either Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (r = −0.185, P = 0.19) or Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment scores (r = −0.194, P = 0.17). Intravenous lipopolysaccharide injection in healthy humans elevated systemic S100A12 levels (peak levels at 3 h of 59.6 ± 22.0 vs. 12.4 ± 3.6 ng/mL; t = 0 h, P < 0.005). In contrast to S100A12, sRAGE concentrations did not change during severe sepsis or human endotoxemia. During peritonitis, S100A12 concentrations in abdominal fluid (12945.8 ± 4142.1 ng/mL) were more than 100-fold higher than in concurrently obtained plasma (121.2 ± 80.4 ng/mL, P < 0.0005), whereas sRAGE levels in abdominal fluid (148.8 ± 36.0 pg/mL) were lower than those in plasma (648.7 ± 145.6 pg/mL, P < 0.005) and did not increase. In conclusion, in severe sepsis, S100A12 is released systemically irrespective of the primary source of infection. During abdominal sepsis, S100A12 release likely predominantly occurs at the site of infection. Concentrations of its high-affinity sRAGE do not change during infection or human endotoxemia.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The extent of S100A12 release and its soluble high-affinity receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) in patients with severe sepsis stratified to the three most common infectious sources and at the site of infection during peritonitis is sought."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5672,"details":{"paperId":"efa845f81fc1f73e46246962d8cd7bb7b430df2e","externalIds":{"MAG":"3081913097","DOI":"10.2210/pdb7cjm/pdb","CorpusId":"225318863"},"title":"SARS CoV-2 PLpro in complex with GRL0617","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1935,"details":{"paperId":"58f69b92c636e42329d81c398143c8d916aeef73","externalIds":{"MAG":"1974464083","PubMedCentral":"7125913","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2004.04.017","CorpusId":"23758167","PubMed":"15207612"},"title":"SARS corona virus peptides recognized by antibodies in the sera of convalescent cases","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":673,"details":{"paperId":"c6e0d7e3dc9e5335941ea8e9b9e99986bd47fe69","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7113864","MAG":"2009299532","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.11.006","CorpusId":"23443539","PubMed":"24269475"},"title":"SARS-CoV ORF1b-encoded nonstructural proteins 12–16: Replicative enzymes as antiviral targets","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"These last ten years of research on SARS-CoV have considerably contributed to unravel structural and functional details of one of the most fascinating replication/transcription machineries of the RNA virus world."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1621,"details":{"paperId":"1b4090c68ce8b0919ee2782f3d54b95776cba3bd","externalIds":{"MAG":"3041682738","PubMedCentral":"7347504","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsb.2020.107575","CorpusId":"220428652","PubMed":"32653646"},"title":"SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main protease residue interaction networks change when bound to inhibitor N3","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Insight is provided into conformational changes of betacoronavirus Mpros when bound to an inhibitor as well as differences in bond energies and relative B-factors when comparing free Mpro to inhibitors."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4086,"details":{"paperId":"25b617bcd8f4524884239a881765e2286dd5b884","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7899479","DOI":"10.1101/2021.01.19.21249840","CorpusId":"232018870","PubMed":"33619509"},"title":"SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 sensitivity to mRNA vaccine-elicited, convalescent and monoclonal antibodies","abstract":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant now seen in 50 countries.

RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), which has no counterpart in human cells, is an excellent target for drug development. Given the time-consuming process of drug development, repurposing drugs approved for other indications or at least successfully tested in terms of safety and tolerability, is an attractive strategy to rapidly provide an effective medication for severe COVID-19 cases. Areas covered: The currently available data and upcominSg studies on RdRp which can be repurposed to halt SARS-CoV-2 replication, are reviewed. Expert opinion: Drug repurposing and design of novel compounds are proceeding in parallel to provide a quick response and new specific drugs, respectively. Notably, the proofreading SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease activity could limit the potential for drugs designed as immediate chain terminators and favor the development of compounds acting through delayed termination. While vaccination is awaited to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, even partially effective drugs from repurposing strategies can be of help to treat severe cases of disease.

Indeed, after a long period under immune selective pressure, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to evade the immunity of a potent polyclonal serum from a COVID-19 convalescent donor. Only three mutations were sufficient to generate this escape variant. The new virus was resistant to 70% of the neutralizing antibodies tested and had a decreased susceptibility to all convalescent sera. Our data predict that, as the immunity in the population increases, following infection and vaccination, new variants will emerge, and therefore vaccines and monoclonal antibodies need to be developed to address them.

Its purported mode of action is as an immune modulator. Vitamin D, however, also affects the metabolism of phosphate and Mg, which may well play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 may induce a cytokine storm that drains ATP whose regeneration requires phosphate and Mg. These minerals, however, are often deficient in conditions that predispose people to severe COVID-19, including older age (especially males), diabetes, obesity, and usage of diuretics. Symptoms observed in severe COVID-19 also fit well with those seen in classical hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, such as thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, dysfunction of liver and kidneys, neurologic disturbances, immunodeficiency, failure of heart and lungs, delayed weaning from a respirator, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, and, finally, multiorgan failure. Deficiencies of phosphate and Mg can be amplified by kidney problems commonly observed in patients with COVID-19 resulting in their wastage into urine. Available data show that phosphate and Mg are deficient in COVID-19, with phosphate showing a remarkable correlation with its severity. In one experiment, patients with COVID-19 were supplemented with a cocktail of vitamin D3, Mg, and vitamin B12, with very encouraging results.

The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research. Methods and Findings In response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients. We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria. In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria. Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture. In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm. Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive. In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm. Conclusions Despite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak. Some may have been harmful.

Here, we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, expressed at high levels in yeast (Pichia pastoris), as a suitable vaccine candidate against COVID-19. After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel® were conducted in mice, and, after two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG antibodies. Using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we further showed that sera obtained after a two-dose immunization schedule of the vaccines were sufficient to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers in the 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 range, for both antigens tested. The vaccines induced IFN-γ IL-6, and IL-10 secretion, among other cytokines. Overall, these data suggest that the RBD219-N1C1 recombinant protein, produced in yeast, is suitable for further evaluation as a human COVID-19 vaccine, in particular, in an Alhydrogel® containing formulation and possibly in combination with other immunostimulants.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Data suggest that the RBD219-N1C1 recombinant protein, produced in yeast, is suitable for further evaluation as a human COVID-19 vaccine, in particular, in an Alhydrogel® containing formulation and possibly in combination with other immunostimulants."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5898,"details":{"paperId":"1dac70f2e3fa662ae5b353a1e9ebac422058bff7","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7644869","MAG":"3094596347","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2020.582102","CorpusId":"225042103","PubMed":"33193390"},"title":"SOCS, Intrinsic Virulence Factors, and Treatment of COVID-19","abstract":"The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of intracellular checkpoint inhibitors has received little recognition compared to other checkpoint inhibitors. Two members of this family, SOCS1 and SOCS3, are indispensable, since SOCS1 knockout in mice results in neonatal death due to interferon gamma (IFNγ) induced inflammatory disease, and SOCS3 knockout leads to embryonic lethality. We have shown that SOCS1 and SOCS3 (SOCS1/3) function as virus induced intrinsic virulence factors for influenza A virus, EMC virus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and vaccinia virus infections. Other viruses such as pathogenic pig enteric coronavirus and coronavirus induced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike protein also induce SOCS virus intrinsic virulence factors. SOCS1/3 exert their viral virulence effect via inhibition of type I and type II interferon (IFN) function. Specifically, the SOCS bind to the activation loop of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases JAK2 and TYK2 through the SOCS kinase inhibitory region (KIR), which inhibits STAT transcription factor activation by the kinases. Activated STATs are required for IFN function. We have developed a small peptide antagonist of SOCS1/3 that blocks SOCS1/3 inhibitory activity and prevents virus pathogenesis. The antagonist, pJAK2(1001-1013), is comprised of the JAK2 activation loop, phosphorylated at tyrosine 1007 with a palmitate for cell penetration. The remarkable thing about SOCS1/3 is that it serves as a broad, simple tool of perhaps most pathogenic viruses to avoid innate host IFN defense. We suggest in this Perspective that SOCS1/3 antagonist is a simple counter measure to SOCS1/3 and should be an effective mechanism as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic against the COVID-19 pandemic that is caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV2.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested in this Perspective that SOCS 1/3 antagonist is a simple counter measure to SOCS1/3 and should be an effective mechanism as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic against the COVID-19 pandemic that is caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV2."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4850,"details":{"paperId":"20b5b252fc5f375f2cae240af77e564bac49ad0a","externalIds":{"MAG":"3045570112","DOI":"10.1136/bmjebm-2020-111497","CorpusId":"220795548","PubMed":"32719054"},"title":"Sacubitril, valsartan and SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"Dear Editor,\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) is responsible for the current global pandemic.

Articles published between 24 January 2020 and 30 May 2021 were retrieved via a PubMed and EMBASE search. A total of 12 reports on phase-3 clinical trials and observational studies of COVID-19 vaccines were included in the review. In terms of vaccine safety, mRNA vaccines showed more relevance to serious adverse events than viral vector and inactivated vaccines, but no solid evidence indicated that COVID-19 vaccines directly caused serious adverse events. Serious metabolic, musculoskeletal, immune-system, and renal disorders were more common among inactivated vaccine recipients, and serious gastrointestinal complications and infections were more common among viral vector and inactivated vaccine recipients. The occurrence of serious vessel disorders was more frequent in mRNA vaccines. In terms of efficacy, two mRNA vaccine doses conferred a lesser risk of SARS-COV-2 infection (odds ratio: 0.05; 95% confidence interval: 0.02–0.13) than did vaccination with viral vector and inactivated vaccines. All vaccines protected more against symptomatic than asymptomatic cases (risk ratio, 0.11 vs. 0.34), but reduced the risk of severe SARS-COV-2 infection. The COVID-19 vaccines assessed in this study are sufficiently safe and effective. The results indicate that two mRNA vaccine doses prevent SARS-COV-2 infection most effectively, but further research is needed due to the high degree of heterogeneity among studies in this sample.

Methods We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or ≥71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 μg or 100 μg of vaccine administered 28 days apart. Results Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-μg dose, the anti–S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-μg dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells. Conclusions In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-μg dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-μg dose, which supports the use of the 100-μg dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

While the spike protein is the key for the virus to enter the cell though the interaction with ACE2, enzymes such as main protease are crucial for the life cycle of the virus. This protein is one of the most attractive targets for the development of new drugs againstCOVID-19 due to its pivotal role in the replication and transcription of the virus. We used 7922 FDA approved small molecule drugs as well as compounds in clinical investigation from NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) database in our drug repurposing study. Both apo and holo forms of target protein COVID-19 main proteases were used in virtual screening. Target proteins were retrieved from protein data bank (PDB IDs, 6M03 and 6LU7). Standard Precision (SP) protocol of Glide docking program of Maestro was used in docking. Compounds were then ranked based on their docking scores that represents binding energies. Top-30 compounds from each docking simulations were considered initially in short (10-ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and their average binding energies using collected 1000 trajectories throughout the MD simulations were calculated by Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) method. Selected promising hit compounds based on average MM/GBSA scores were then used in long (100-ns) MD simulations.

It appeared that HR2 peptides, but not HR1 peptides, were inhibitory. Their efficacy was, however, significantly lower than that of corresponding HR2 peptides of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in inhibiting MHV infection. Biochemical and electron microscopical analyses showed that, when mixed, SARS-CoV HR1 and HR2 peptides assemble into a six-helix bundle consisting of HR1 as a central triple-stranded coiled coil in association with three HR2 alpha-helices oriented in an antiparallel manner. The stability of this complex, as measured by its resistance to heat dissociation, appeared to be much lower than that of the corresponding MHV complex, which may explain the different inhibitory potencies of the HR2 peptides. Analogous to other class I viral fusion proteins, the six-helix complex supposedly represents a postfusion conformation that is formed after insertion of the fusion peptide, proposed here for coronaviruses to be located immediately upstream of HR1, into the target membrane.

SARS-CoV-2: From entry to autophagy? SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters cells through endocytosis upon binding to the cell surface receptor ACE2 and potentially others, including integrins. Using bioinformatics, Mészáros et al. predicted the presence of short amino acid sequences, called short linear motifs (SLiMs), in the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and various integrins that may engage the endocytic and autophagic machinery. Using affinity binding assays, Kliche et al. not only confirmed that many of these predicted SLiMs interacted with target peptides in various components of the endocytosis and autophagy machinery but also found that these interactions were regulated by the phosphorylation of SLiM-adjacent amino acids. Together, these findings have identified a potential link between autophagy and integrin signaling and could lead to new ways to prevent viral infection. The first reported receptor for SARS-CoV-2 on host cells was the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the viral spike protein also has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource and identified candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton, and cell signaling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates and may interact with the μ2 subunit of the endocytosis-associated AP2 adaptor complex, as well as with various protein domains (namely, I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB, and SH2) found in human signaling and regulatory proteins. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, such as in response to tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs are present in the tails of integrin β3 and ACE2, suggesting that these proteins could directly recruit autophagy components. Our findings identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that could uncover mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and replication against which it may be possible to develop host-directed therapies that dampen viral infection and disease progression. Several of these SLiMs have now been validated to mediate the predicted peptide interactions.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The findings identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that could uncover mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and replication against which it may be possible to develop host-directed therapies that dampen viral infection and disease progression."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5604,"details":{"paperId":"a2258a88b27431b41259e869bb8780c77f1ee404","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-31834/v1","CorpusId":"231886688"},"title":"Shortlisting Phytochemicals Exhibiting Inhibitory Activity against Major Proteins of SARS-CoV-2 through Virtual Screening","abstract":"\n Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) declared as a pandemic by WHO that has affected more than 40 lakh peoples and caused death of more than 2 lakh individuals across the globe.

Results There is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway. The empirical data available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results. Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (n = 30 and n = 36) and suffer methodological limitations. No medium or long-term follow-up data is available. Conclusion At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.

Here we present a comprehensive examination of the host- and virus-targeted functions of the flavonolignan silibinin, a potential drug candidate against COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2. As a direct inhibitor of STAT3—a master checkpoint regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling and immune response—silibinin might be expected to phenotypically integrate the mechanisms of action of IL-6-targeted monoclonal antibodies and pan-JAK1/2 inhibitors to limit the cytokine storm and T-cell lymphopenia in the clinical setting of severe COVID-19. As a computationally predicted, remdesivir-like inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)—the central component of the replication/transcription machinery of SARS-CoV-2—silibinin is expected to reduce viral load and impede delayed interferon responses.

While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than that with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable/less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound library focused around the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel druglike compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50’s of 0.2–3.0 μM), whereas control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs of interest identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not hACE2.

We wish to highlight that the molecular pathways and targets potentially linked to a favourable effect of statins in SARS-CoV-2 infection could be wider than those described. In a cohort of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, the severity of the disease appears to be associated with a significant alteration of plasma cytokine levels, mainly, but not exclusively, interleukin-6 (IL-6), found at the beginning of the infection both in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients, and in the latter the increased cytokine profiles were more pronounced and sustained. Raised amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly Th1 derived, have been associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) patients, but, interestingly, the increased secretion of cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10, from Th-2 lymphocytes that substantially suppress inflammation, seems to represent a distinctive feature of SARS-CoV-2. Of course, in a retrospective multicentre cohort study, including 191 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, the levels of blood IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course, and significantly associated with deterioration of the condition. Cholesterol plays an essential role in the activation/dysregulation of the immune response and in the onset and pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); an impressive and complex network of cellular elements and soluble factors is involved. Among others, the immune cells, mainly monocytes and Th-2 lymphocytes, and the dysregulation of secreted proand anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10) appear to play a pivotal role in the progression of ARDS and, consequently, in the severity of the prognosis. IL-10 is commonly recognized as an antiinflammatory cytokine, responsible for controlling and resolving inflammatory processes. However, in mouse models overexpressing IL10, lung damage induced by marked B/T lymphocytic infiltration, increased collagen deposition, and a raised number of M2 macrophages (both in bronchoalveolar lavage and in lung tissue) were shown, and a significant increase in the chemokine CCL2 was responsible for the recruitment of fibrocytes in the lung. Increased expression of CCL2/CCL2 receptor also appears to be a distinctive feature of eosinophilic pulmonary granuloma induced by Schistosoma mansoni, and of some severe forms of allergic asthma. A recent study identified the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as a key regulator dictating the CD4þ T cell switch from the effector (Th1 cell) to the anti-inflammatory (IL-10-secreting Th2 cell) phenotype, a process largely involved in persistent chronic inflammatory diseases and also in ARDS. In CD4þ T cells purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors, atorvastatin or 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased IL-10 expression and significantly expanded the Th1 population responsible for a protective and resolving inflammatory response. Last, but not least, severe alterations in haemostatic profiles are associated with fatal prognosis in COVID-19 infection, and growing evidence show that the virus predisposed patients to serious thrombotic events encouraged by stasis, massive inflammation, and endothelial and platelet dysfunctions. In a recent retrospective study of 183 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, a mortality rate of 11.5%, associated with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and high levels of both D-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels, has been reported. In non-survivors, 71.4% of deaths matched the criteria of a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). Moreover, thrombocytopenia was associated with a five-fold increased risk of severe disease and with mortality, as reported in a metaanalysis of 1779 patients affected by SARSCoV-2. Several pieces of data have highlighted the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of statins at least in deep vein thrombosis. In mouse models of chemical-induced venous thrombosis, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin improve vein thrombosis resolution via profibrinolytic, anticoagulant, and anti-vein wall scarring effects. In this model, statins reduced thrombus plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue factor, neutrophils, and myeloperoxidase, with an efficacy similar to that observed for low molecular weight heparin. Moreover, a recent randomized clinical trial highlighted that rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) substantially improved the coagulation profile in patients with recurrent venous thrombosis. The ability of statins to reduce the expression of PAI-1 and tissue factor could be a key element to hinder not only thrombotic complications but also, at the same time, the occurrence of ARDS. In the development of pulmonary fibrosis, an altered balance between the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its inhibitor PAI-1 has been described, and uPA increased prostaglandin E2 secretion, acting as an antifibrotic signal, in fibrocytes and alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, in uPA receptor-deficient mice, non-specific interstitial pneumonia-like histopathological features and peripheral microvasculopathy have been observed. Taken together, these pieces of evidence show that statins can act on far more than one molecular target and suggest that the benefits that statins could offer in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 are more than just a hypothesis.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Severe alterations in haemostatic profiles are associated with fatal prognosis in COVID-19 infection, and growing evidence show that the virus predisposed patients to serious thrombotic events encouraged by stasis, massive inflammation, and endothelial and platelet dysfunctions."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2913,"details":{"paperId":"a7866400df54a96530aa6bc36214c0427292b90a","externalIds":{"MAG":"3093064593","PubMedCentral":"7562925","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-74492-0","CorpusId":"222825539","PubMed":"33060704"},"title":"Statin use is associated with lower disease severity in COVID-19 infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Logistic treatment models showed a lower chance of ICU admission for statin users when compared to non-statin users, which supports current practice to continue prescription of statins in COVID-19 patients."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":716,"details":{"paperId":"bbdedbf120a7ab56e25d894e6522b9b30f8d729e","externalIds":{"MAG":"3039475926","PubMedCentral":"7648510","DOI":"10.1016/j.artere.2020.11.004","CorpusId":"226274111"},"title":"Statins in COVID-19: Is there any foundation?☆","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The pathophysiological foundations that support the use of statins as an adjunctive treatment in patients with COVID-19 are analyzed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4257,"details":{"paperId":"59252f0c52c3fd7b2ef3f8638d34e4d9feb7c1a8","externalIds":{"MAG":"3035860713","PubMedCentral":"7323198","DOI":"10.1111/bph.15166","CorpusId":"219948771","PubMed":"32562276"},"title":"Statins: Could an old friend help in the fight against COVID‐19?","abstract":"The COVID‐19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has overwhelmed healthcare systems requiring the rapid development of treatments, at least, to reduce COVID‐19 severity.

The current study aimed to repurpose stilbenoid analogs, reported for some other biological activities, against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor complex for their affinity and stability using molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis based on molecular docking. Four compounds in total were probed for their binding affinity using molecular docking. All of the compounds showed good affinity (> −7 kcal/mol). However, fifty nanoseconds molecular dynamic simulation in aqueous solution revealed highly stable bound conformation of resveratrol to the viral protein: ACE2 receptor complex. Net free energy of binding using MM-PBSA also affirmed the stability of the resveratrol-protein complex.

The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Structural features of SARS-CoV-2 are reviewed with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6146,"details":{"paperId":"5c3b6d74430ebce5d995b98904285ab62f6c29c8","externalIds":{"MAG":"3029648091","PubMedCentral":"7352291","DOI":"10.3390/nu12061562","CorpusId":"219103782","PubMed":"32471251"},"title":"Strengthening the Immune System and Reducing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress through Diet and Nutrition: Considerations during the COVID-19 Crisis","abstract":"The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Challenges arise concerning how to optimally support the immune system in the general population, especially under self-confinement. An optimal immune response depends on an adequate diet and nutrition in order to keep infection at bay. For example, sufficient protein intake is crucial for optimal antibody production. Low micronutrient status, such as of vitamin A or zinc, has been associated with increased infection risk. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can impact the immune system. Dietary constituents with especially high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity include vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Several of these can interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB and Nrf-2, related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively. Vitamin D in particular may perturb viral cellular infection via interacting with cell entry receptors (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), ACE2. Dietary fiber, fermented by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, has also been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effects.

Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be −2.80 ± 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP.

Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data from 76 human populations demonstrates that a functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in the TMPRSS2 gene is found in many human populations at relatively high frequencies, with region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by rs12329760, which has previously been found to be associated with prostate cancer, ranged between 10% and 63% and was significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared with European populations. In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, two copy number variants were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. A number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells.

We analyzed 294 anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found that immunoglobulin G heavy-chain variable region 3-53 (IGHV3-53) is the most frequently used IGHV gene for targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Co-crystal structures of two IGHV3-53–neutralizing antibodies with RBD, with or without Fab CR3022, at 2.33- to 3.20-angstrom resolution revealed that the germline-encoded residues dominate recognition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–binding site. This binding mode limits the IGHV3-53 antibodies to short complementarity-determining region H3 loops but accommodates light-chain diversity. These IGHV3-53 antibodies show minimal affinity maturation and high potency, which is promising for vaccine design. Knowledge of these structural motifs and binding mode should facilitate the design of antigens that elicit this type of neutralizing response.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that immunoglobulin G heavy-chain variable region 3-53 (IGHV3-53) is the most frequently used IGHV gene for targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which is promising for vaccine design."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2882,"details":{"paperId":"c5610c682147fa3745a67d25e28e5ed4b1e5090b","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41594-020-00544-8","CorpusId":"231595783","PubMed":"33437043"},"title":"Structural biology in the fight against COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["News"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2717,"details":{"paperId":"e0aa7d40c4b1a7cb48378f124d8ad92f99199445","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8447893","DOI":"10.1038/s41579-021-00630-8","CorpusId":"237555411","PubMed":"34535791"},"title":"Structural biology of SARS-CoV-2 and implications for therapeutic development","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The structure and function of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins is vital for understanding the molecular mechanisms of viral replication and COVID-19 pathogenesis, and could lead to the development of novel therapeutics."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4004,"details":{"paperId":"109046120e753239da201f5ee38b8f90b82094b6","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7457611","MAG":"3082104878","DOI":"10.1101/2020.08.30.273920","CorpusId":"221399634","PubMed":"32869026"},"title":"Structural classification of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain suggests vaccine and therapeutic strategies","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic presents an urgent health crisis.

Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases and main protease for viral replication. Using the bioinformatics and structural modelling approach, we modelled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modelling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated ion channel conducting H+ ions. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds which was further validated by insertion of the E protein in an ERGIC-mimic membrane. Additionally, two distinct “core” structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral ion channeling activity which plays a critical role in viral infection and pathogenesis.

However, these large proteins are difficult to produce in the needed quantities and at low cost. Attention has turned to nanobodies, which are aptly named, single-domain antibodies that are easier to produce and have the potential to be administered by inhalation. Koenig et al. describe four nanobodies that bind to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and prevent infection of cells (see the Perspective by Saelens and Schepens). Structures show that the nanobodies target two distinct epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Multivalent nanobodies neutralize virus much more potently than single nanobodies, and multivalent nanobodies that bind two epitopes prevent the emergence of viral escape mutants. Science, this issue p. eabe6230; see also p. 681 SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing nanobodies were combined to design potent multivalent nanobodies. INTRODUCTION The global scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose unprecedented challenges to society, health care systems, and science. In addition to effective and safe vaccines, passive immunization by antibody-related molecules offers an opportunity to harness the vertebrate immune system to fight viral infections in high-risk patients. Variable domains of heavy-chain–only antibodies (VHHs), also known as nanobodies, are suitable lead molecules in such efforts, as they are small, extremely stable, easy to engineer, and economic to produce in simple expression systems. RATIONALE We engineered improved multivalent nanobodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of two principles: (i) detailed structural information of their epitopes and binding modes to the viral spike protein and (ii) mechanistic insights into viral fusion with cellular membranes catalyzed by the spike. RESULTS Nanobodies specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike were identified by phage display using nanobody libraries from an alpaca and a llama immunized with the RBD and inactivated virus. Four of the resulting nanobodies—VHHs E, U, V, and W—potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2–pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus. X-ray crystallography revealed that the nanobodies bind to two distinct epitopes on the RBD, interfaces “E” and “UVW,” which can be synergistically targeted by combinations of nanobodies to inhibit infection. Cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of trimeric spike in complex with VHH E and VHH V revealed that VHH E stabilizes a conformation of the spike with all three RBDs in the “up” conformation (3-up), a state that is typically associated with activation by receptor binding. In line with this observation, we found that VHH E triggers the fusion activity of spike in the absence of the cognate receptor ACE2. VHH V, by contrast, stabilizes spike in a 2-up conformation and does not induce fusion. On the basis of the structural information, we designed bi- and trivalent nanobodies with improved neutralizing properties. VHH EEE most potently inhibited infection, did not activate fusion, and likely inactivated virions by outcompeting interaction of the virus with its receptor. Yet evolution experiments revealed emergence of escape mutants in the spike with single–amino acid changes that were completely insensitive to inhibition by VHH EEE. VHH VE also neutralized more efficiently than VHH E or VHH V alone; stabilized the 3-up conformation of spike, as determined by cryo-EM; and more strongly induced the spike fusogenic activity. We conclude that the premature activation of the fusion machinery on virions was an unexpected mechanism of neutralization, as enhanced neutralization could not be attributed simply to better blocking of virus-receptor interactions. Activation of spike in the absence of target membranes likely induces irreversible conformational changes to assume the energetically favorable postfusion conformation without catalyzing fusion per se. Simultaneous targeting of two independent epitopes by VHH VE largely prevented the emergence of resistant escape mutants in evolution experiments. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate the strength of the modular combination of nanobodies for neutralization. Premature activation of spike by nanobodies reveals an unusual mode of neutralization and yields insights into the mechanism of fusion. Bivalent nanobodies neutralize by inducing postfusion conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. On virions, SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers are mostly in an inactive configuration with all RBDs in the down conformation (left). Binding of bivalent nanobody VE stabilizes the spike in an active conformation with all RBDs up (middle), triggering premature induction of the postfusion conformation, which irreversibly inactivates the spike protein (right). The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread, with devastating consequences. For passive immunization efforts, nanobodies have size and cost advantages over conventional antibodies. In this study, we generated four neutralizing nanobodies that target the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We used x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy to define two distinct binding epitopes. On the basis of these structures, we engineered multivalent nanobodies with more than 100 times the neutralizing activity of monovalent nanobodies. Biparatopic nanobody fusions suppressed the emergence of escape mutants. Several nanobody constructs neutralized through receptor binding competition, whereas other monovalent and biparatopic nanobodies triggered aberrant activation of the spike fusion machinery. These premature conformational changes in the spike protein forestalled productive fusion and rendered the virions noninfectious.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Improved multivalent nanobodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 were engineered on the basis of detailed structural information of their epitopes and binding modes to the viral spike protein and mechanistic insights into viral fusion with cellular membranes catalyzed by the spike."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":889,"details":{"paperId":"a23dd75b617ba129523932a693f6616cf27885ba","externalIds":{"MAG":"3036607916","PubMedCentral":"7311918","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.025","CorpusId":"219981024","PubMed":"32645326"},"title":"Structures of Human Antibodies Bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Reveal Common Epitopes and Recurrent Features of Antibodies","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Overall, the studies structurally define a recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody class derived from VH3-53/Vh3-66 and similarity to a SARS- coV VH 3-30 antibody, providing criteria for evaluating vaccine-elicited antibodies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2525,"details":{"paperId":"0872161bcd279ea4337a33145003025218e77ecc","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8385480","DOI":"10.1038/s41422-021-00555-0","CorpusId":"236899376","PubMed":"34433900"},"title":"Structures of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 neutralizing antibodies provide insights into cocktail design against concerning variants","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Two superpotent mAbs, BD-812 andBD-836, have non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike that block the interaction between RBD and the ACE2 receptor and could serve as an ideal antibody cocktail against the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3855,"details":{"paperId":"dbad412eac3b4c3e0cf96339e95425e37cc9d6ef","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7302198","MAG":"3030382341","DOI":"10.1101/2020.05.28.121533","CorpusId":"219167991","PubMed":"32577645"},"title":"Structures of human antibodies bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike reveal common epitopes and recurrent features of antibodies","abstract":"Neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses focus on the trimeric spike, with most against the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barriers to infect humans. Bats, which harbour a diverse pool of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs), are believed to be the natural reservoir. The SARS-CoV surface Spike (S) protein is a major antigenic determinant in eliciting neutralizing antibody production during SARS-CoV infection. In our previous work, we showed that a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the S2 subunit of the S protein are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro (Lip KM et al, J Virol. 2006 Jan; 80(2): 941–50). In this study, we report our findings on the characterization of one of these mAbs, known as 1A9, which binds to the S protein at a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111–1130. MAb 1A9 is a broadly neutralizing mAb that prevents viral entry mediated by the S proteins of human and civet SARS-CoVs as well as bat SL-CoVs. By generating mutant SARS-CoV that escapes the neutralization by mAb 1A9, the residue D1128 in S was found to be crucial for its interaction with mAb 1A9.

The newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and reemerging influenza virus cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP3014) or wild-type VEE glycoproteins (VRP3000) in young and aged mice within novel models of severe SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP3000-based vaccines were protected from SARS-CoV disease, while animals receiving the VRP3014-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP3000-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal influenza virus challenge model. While the VRP3000 vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP3014 platform mediate vaccine failure.

The flexible key binding site residues Tyr269 and Gln270 for small-molecule recognition in SARS-CoV PLpro exist also in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro.

ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has impacted public health, society, the global economy, and the daily lives of billions of people in an unprecedented manner. There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here, we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of ∼20 μM, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2 to 3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3 2B4 [referred to here as “Calu-3”]) were treated. Time-of-addition and plaque reduction assays performed on Vero E6 cells showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing binding or entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest that it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires safety studies and well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results of the preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest that it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires safety studies and well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2352,"details":{"paperId":"26c792d5a4a349af6c01a347c98faee5d57c665c","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1021/jacs.1c06778","CorpusId":"238990916","PubMed":"34652144"},"title":"Sweet Drugs for Bad Bugs: A Glycomimetic Strategy against the DC-SIGN-Mediated Dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.","abstract":"The C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN is a pattern recognition receptor expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells.

Inhibition of virus binding to DC-SIGN, thus, represents an attractive host-directed strategy to attenuate overshooting innate immune responses and prevent the progression of the disease. In this study, we report on the discovery of a new class of potent glycomimetic DC-SIGN antagonists from a focused library of triazole-based mannose analogues. Structure-based optimization of an initial screening hit yielded a glycomimetic ligand with a more than 100-fold improved binding affinity compared to methyl α-d-mannopyranoside. Analysis of binding thermodynamics revealed an enthalpy-driven improvement of binding affinity that was enabled by hydrophobic interactions with a loop region adjacent to the binding site and displacement of a conserved water molecule. The identified ligand was employed for the synthesis of multivalent glycopolymers that were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binding to DC-SIGN-expressing cells, as well as DC-SIGN-mediated trans-infection of ACE2+ cells by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-expressing viruses, in nanomolar concentrations.

The amalgamation of IF and a ketogenic diet rich in MCTs is thought to work as a prophylactic measure for normal people and adjunct therapy for infected persons.

The membrane bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the entry point of COVID-19 2. Conversely, it supports an anti-inflammatory pathway. This led to the controversy of the impact of medications, which influence its expression. ACE2 is part of the wider renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and is upregulated via compounds, which inhibits the classical ACE, thereby plasma aldosterone and aldosterone receptor (MR) activation. MR activation may therefore protect organs from binding the COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 expression. Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a frequent component in traditional Chinese medicines, which have been used to control COVID-19 infections. Its systemically active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) inhibits 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase(11betaHSD2) and activates MR in organs, which express this enzyme, including the lungs. Does this affect the protective effect of ACE2? Importantly, GL has anti-inflammatory properties by itself via toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonism and therefore compensates for the reduced protection of the downregulated ACE2. Finally, a direct effect of GL or GA to reduce virus transmission exists, which may involve reduced expression of type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), which is required for virus uptake. Glycyrrhizin may reduce the severity of an infection with COVID-19 at the two stages of the COVID-19 induced disease process, 1.

This study provides an initial evaluation of current drug candidates from various reports using our systemic in silico drug screening based on structures of viral proteins and human ACE2 receptor. Additionally, we have built an interactive online platform (https://shennongproject.ai/) for browsing these results with the visual display of a small molecule docked on its potential target protein, without installing any specialized structural software. With continuous maintenance and incorporation of data from laboratory work, it may serve not only as the assessment tool for the new drug discovery but also an educational web site for the public.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study provides an initial evaluation of current drug candidates from various reports using systemic in silico drug screening based on structures of viral proteins and human ACE2 receptor and builds an interactive online platform for browsing these results."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":668,"details":{"paperId":"c81c66e1755b4ca359b49ac745e1c0499357093b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7114272","MAG":"1975428045","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.12.001","CorpusId":"205572747","PubMed":"19995578"},"title":"TACE antagonists blocking ACE2 shedding caused by the spike protein of SARS-CoV are candidate antiviral compounds","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data suggest that TACE antagonists block SARS-CoV infection and also attenuate its severe clinical outcome, and TNF-α production in lung tissues."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1591,"details":{"paperId":"33aa7a96bbe963ed38275a54e23d87a9b9bda68f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7156211","MAG":"3012515447","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.005","CorpusId":"214630230","PubMed":"32205092"},"title":"TH17 responses in cytokine storm of COVID-19: An emerging target of JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"TH17 responses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 are reviewed and an FDA approved JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib is proposed for reducing mortality of patients with TH17 type immune profiles."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4935,"details":{"paperId":"c8c690a2de8bd11d424d635868f2c6dd797cdb16","externalIds":{"MAG":"3015403775","DOI":"10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0451","CorpusId":"215733009","PubMed":"32276929"},"title":"TMPRSS2 and COVID-19: Serendipity or opportunity for intervention?","abstract":"TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

Instead, the virus may persist in communities causing recurrent local outbreaks of the acute infection as well as several chronic diseases that may arise from the presence of a “suppressed” virus or as a consequence of the initial exposure. An ideal solution would be an anti-viral medication that (i) targets multiple stages of the viral lifecycle, (ii) is insensitive to frequent changes of viral phenotype due to mutagenesis, (iii) has broad spectrum, (iv) is safe and (v) also targets co-morbidities of the infection. In this Perspective we discuss a therapeutic approach that owns these attributes, namely “lipid raft therapy.” Lipid raft therapy is an approach aimed at reducing the abundance and structural modifications of host lipid rafts or at targeted delivery of therapeutics to the rafts. Lipid rafts are the sites of the initial binding, activation, internalization and cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The C-terminal domain of N protein (CTD) involves in the self-assembly of N protein into a filament that is packaged into new virions. In this study, the CTD (PDB ID: 6WJI) was targeted for the identification of possible inhibitors of oligomerization of N protein. Herein, multiple computational approaches were employed to explore the potential mechanisms of binding and inhibitor activity of five antiviral drugs toward CTD. The five anti-N drugs studied in this work are 4E1RCat, Silmitasertib, TMCB, Sapanisertib, and Rapamycin. Among the five drugs, 4E1RCat displayed highest binding affinity (-10.95 kcal/mol), followed by rapamycin (-8.91 kcal/mol), silmitasertib (-7.89 kcal/mol), TMCB (-7.05 kcal/mol), and sapanisertib (-6.14 kcal/mol). Subsequently, stability and dynamics of the protein-drug complex were examined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Overall, drug binding increases the stability of the complex with maximum stability observed in the case of 4E1RCat. The CTD-drug complex systems behave differently in terms of the free energy landscape and showed differences in population distribution. Overall, the MD simulation parameters like RMSD, RMSF, Rg, hydrogen bonds analysis, PCA, FEL, and DCCM analysis indicated that 4E1RCat and TMCB complexes were more stable as compared to silmitasertib and sapanisertib and thus could act as effective drug compounds against CTD.

The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it imperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2′-O-MTase methylates the ribose 2′-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (ΔG), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From the virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (ΔG = −9.8 kcal/mol) & Raltegravir (ΔG = −7.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (ΔG = −9.4 kcal/mol) and Bictegravir (ΔG = −8.4 kcal/mol) for 2′-OMTase].

The host serine protease TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases Cathepsin B/L can activate S, making two independent entry pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. Blocking the proteases prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro. This blockade may be achieved in vivo through ‘repurposing’ drugs, a potential treatment option for COVID-19 that is now in clinical trials. Here, we found, surprisingly, that drugs targeting the two pathways, although independent, could display strong synergy in blocking virus entry. We predicted this synergy first using a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 entry and dynamics in vitro. The model considered the two pathways explicitly, let the entry efficiency through a pathway depend on the corresponding protease expression level, which varied across cells, and let inhibitors compromise the efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. The synergy predicted was novel and arose from effects of the drugs at both the single cell and the cell population levels.

Recent studies have shown that immune cells such as macrophages are the main contributors to the inflammatory response seen in the later inflammatory phase of COVID-19. Immune cells in the context of a viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2 undergo metabolic reprogramming to elicit these pro-inflammatory effector functions. The evidence of metabolic reprogramming in COVID-19 offers opportunities for metabolites with immunomodulatory properties to be investigated as potential therapies to combat this hyper-inflammatory response. Recent research indicates that the metabolite itaconate, previously known to be broadly antibacterial, may have both antiviral and immunomodulatory potential. Furthermore, low itaconate levels have shown to correlate with COVID-19 disease severity, potentially implicating its importance in the disease. The antiviral potential of itaconate has encouraged researchers to synthesise itaconate derivatives for antiviral screening, with some encouraging results.

Our findings indicate that the s2m element can be targeted by antisense oligonucleotides. The antiviral potential of this conserved element represents a promising start for further research into targeting conserved elements in RNA viruses. ABSTRACT RNA structural elements occur in numerous single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. The stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is one such element with an unusually high degree of sequence conservation, being found in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) in the genomes of many astroviruses, some picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts imply a key role for s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodeled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m element is readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as antiviral agents.

Besides using the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor as a main gate, the CoV-2 can bind to the glucose-regulating protein 78 (GRP78) receptor to get into the cells to start an infection. Here, we report potential inhibitors comprising small molecules and peptides that could interfere with the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and its target cells by blocking the recognition of the GRP78 cellular receptor by the viral Spike protein.

This new disease was named COVID‐19 and the causative virus SARS‐CoV‐2. The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein‐ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro‐inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1–7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self‐powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID‐19 patients prior to development of ARDS.

Here we established a quantitative fusion assay dependent on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S protein, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2, and found that nafamostat mesylate potently inhibited the fusion while camostat mesylate was about 10-fold less active. Furthermore, nafamostat mesylate blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells with an effective concentration (EC)50 around 10 nM, which is below its average blood concentration after intravenous administration through continuous infusion. On the other hand, a significantly higher dose (EC50 around 30 μM) was required for VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, where the TMPRSS2-independent but cathepsin-dependent endosomal infection pathway likely predominates. Together, our study shows that nafamostat mesylate potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated fusion in a cell fusion assay system and also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro in a cell-type-dependent manner.

Pharmacological targeting of a host factor required for viral replication can suppress viral spread with a low probability of viral mutation leading to resistance. In particular, host kinases are highly druggable targets and a number of conserved coronavirus proteins, notably the nucleoprotein (N), require phosphorylation for full functionality. In order to understand how targeting kinases could be used to compromise viral replication, we used a combination of phosphoproteomics and bioinformatics as well as genetic and pharmacological kinase inhibition to define the enzymes important for SARS-CoV-2 N protein phosphorylation and viral replication. From these data, we propose a model whereby SRPK1/2 initiates phosphorylation of the N protein, which primes for further phosphorylation by GSK-3α/β and CK1 to achieve extensive phosphorylation of the N protein SR-rich domain. Importantly, we were able to leverage our data to identify an FDA-approved kinase inhibitor, Alectinib, that suppresses N phosphorylation by SRPK1/2 and limits SARS-CoV-2 replication.

No approved vaccines or treatments in the USA currently exist for COVID-19, so there is an urgent need to develop effective countermeasures. The IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH.

Its sequence shares 79.6% identity to SARS–CoV (1, 2), the infectious virus that caused an epidemic in 2003 (2, 3). SARS–CoV-2 has a single-stranded, plus-sense, RNA genome of approximately 30 kb, which includes five major open reading frames encoding nonstructural replicase polyproteins and structural proteins (1), namely, spike (S) (4–6), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (7), and they are in the same order and of approximately the same sizes as those in SARS-CoV. The SARS–CoV-2 S protein is being used as the leading target antigen in vaccine development (8, 9). However, the complex molecular details of viral entry may lead to complications with the vaccine response, similar to those seen with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Env protein vaccine efforts (10). The SARS–CoV-2 S gene has 76% amino acid similarity to the SARS-CoV S gene (11), and nonsynonymous mutations developed in the S protein as the SARS-CoV epidemic progressed (12, 13). In contrast, the N gene is more conserved and stable, with 90% amino acid homology and fewer mutations over time (2, 3, 11, 14–16). N proteins of many coronaviruses are highly immunogenic and are expressed abundantly during infection (17). High levels of IgG antibodies against N have been detected in sera from SARS patients (18), and the N protein is a representative antigen for the T-cell response in a vaccine setting, inducing SARS-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity (19, 20). We have already shown that the middle or C-terminal region of the SARS-CoV N protein is important for eliciting antibodies against SARS-CoV during the immune response (21–23). New reports have additionally shown that the crystal structure of the SARS–CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is similar to those of previously described coronavirus N proteins, but their surface electrostatic potential characteristics are distinct (7). Sheikh et al. studied the factors influencing N gene variations among 13 coronaviruses and how these affect virus-host relationships, reporting a high AT% and low GC% in the nucleotide contents of SARS coronavirus (24). In this issue, Cong et al. (17) used a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model to show that the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein contributes to forming helical ribonucleoproteins during the packaging of the RNA genome, regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication and transcription and modulating metabolism in infected subjects. This study complements others that have shown N to have multiple functions (25). It is becoming more evident just how critical this protein is for multiple steps of the viral life cycle. These reports offer important and timely insights relevant to the SARS–CoV-2 N protein, a vaccine target that has some distinct advantages over other potential SARS– CoV-2 antigens. Because of the conservation of the N protein sequence, the expanding Citation Dutta NK, Mazumdar K, Gordy JT. 2020. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS–CoV-2: a target for vaccine development.

Despite urgent and extensive global efforts, the existing evidence is inconclusive regarding the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. Purpose To generate an up-to-date evidence for the clinical safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZ) among patients treated for COVID-19. Data Source. PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, LITCOVID, Web of Science, SCOPUS, BioRxiv, Embase, MedRxiv, and Wiley online library were searched from 2019/12/30 to 2020/05/23. Study Selection. Three investigators assessed the quality of the studies. Data Extraction. Data about study characteristics, effect estimates, and the quality of the studies were extracted by two independent reviewers and cross-checked by the third reviewer. Data Synthesis. The data of 6,782 (HCQ group, 3623; HCQ + AZ group, 1,020; control group, 2139) participants were included. HCQ was compared with standard care for virologic efficacy, disease progression, mortality, and adverse effects. HCQ was also compared with HCQ + AZ for QTc prolongation, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality. The study found HCQ did not alter the rate of virologic cure (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.39–1.56) and the risk of mortality (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.66–2.39). The pooled prevalence for mortality was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.9%–10.8%). Moreover, HCQ did not impact disease progression (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.36–2.29) but resulted in a higher risk of adverse effects (OR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.15–4.8). HCQ was also compared against HCQ + AZ, and no difference was observed in QTc prolongation above 500 ms (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.54–2.28), admission to the intensive care unit (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.52–1.63), and mortality (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.55–1.43). However, in the analysis of single-arm studies, about 11.2% (95% CI: 7.0%–15.5%) of patients have developed an absolute increase of QTc greater than 500 ms, and 4.1% (95% CI: 1.1%–7.1%) of patients discontinued their medication. Conclusion This meta-analysis and systematic review, which included a limited number of poorly designed studies of patients with COVID-19, revealed HCQ is intolerable, unsafe, and not efficacious.

It has prompted researchers to rapidly mobilize their efforts towards identifying and developing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Discovering and understanding the virus’ pathways of infection, host-protein interactions, and cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. While it is known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including inhibiting autophagy, there are also dose-limiting toxicities in patients that make clearly establishing their potential mechanisms-of-action problematic. Therefore, we evaluated a range of other autophagy modulators to identify an alternative autophagy-based drug repurposing opportunity.

We tested the hypothesis that inhibitors of these proteases, the serine protease inhibitors camostat and nafamostat, block infection by SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality on a global scale. The etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), initiates host cell entry when its spike protein (S) binds to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In airway epithelia, the spike protein is cleaved by the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, facilitating membrane fusion and entry at the cell surface. This dependence on TMPRSS2 and related proteases suggests that protease inhibitors might limit SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract. Here, we tested two serine protease inhibitors, camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate, for their ability to inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 and that of a second pathogenic coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both camostat and nafamostat reduced infection in primary human airway epithelia and in the Calu-3 2B4 cell line, with nafamostat exhibiting greater potency. We then assessed whether nafamostat was protective against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo using two mouse models. In mice sensitized to SARS-CoV-2 infection by transduction with human ACE2, intranasal nafamostat treatment prior to or shortly after SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced weight loss and lung tissue titers. Similarly, prophylactic intranasal treatment with nafamostat reduced weight loss, viral burden, and mortality in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. These findings establish nafamostat as a candidate for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The causative agent of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), requires host cell surface proteases for membrane fusion and entry into airway epithelia. We tested the hypothesis that inhibitors of these proteases, the serine protease inhibitors camostat and nafamostat, block infection by SARS-CoV-2. We found that both camostat and nafamostat reduce infection in human airway epithelia, with nafamostat showing greater potency. We then asked whether nafamostat protects mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent COVID-19 lung disease. We performed infections in mice made susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection by introducing the human version of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, into their airway epithelia. We observed that pretreating these mice with nafamostat prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in better outcomes, in the form of less virus-induced weight loss, viral replication, and mortality than that observed in the untreated control mice. These results provide preclinical evidence for the efficacy of nafamostat in treating and/or preventing COVID-19.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Nafamostat is established as a candidate for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease pathogenesis and preclinical evidence for the efficacy of nafamOSTat in treating and/or preventing COVID-19 is provided."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4933,"details":{"paperId":"a6bdeb02ab4b3fe8ddaa10073e6a66a417e260cb","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8324379","DOI":"10.1155/2021/7769516","CorpusId":"236530090","PubMed":"34336280"},"title":"The Use of CytoSorb Therapy in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: Review of the Rationale and Current Clinical Experiences","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the biggest global health crisis of our lifetime.

A rush to find a cure prompted re-evaluation of a range of existing therapeutics vis-à-vis their potential role in treating COVID-19, placing a premium on analytical tools capable of supporting such efforts. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has long been a tool of choice in supporting the mechanistic studies of drug/therapeutic target interactions, but its applications remain limited in the cases that involve systems with a high level of structural heterogeneity. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS. However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the noncovalent complexes formed by ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Using this technique in combination with molecular modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. Both short (pentasaccharide) and relatively long (eicosasaccharide) heparin oligomers form 1:1 complexes with RBD, indicating the presence of a single binding site. This association alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD surface), resulting in a notable decrease in its ability to associate with ACE2. The destabilizing effect of heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6045,"details":{"paperId":"057a16cf8f411a3e0be7ae46d4b3829d6bd7d7d4","externalIds":{"MAG":"3043042229","PubMedCentral":"7408073","DOI":"10.3390/cells9071704","CorpusId":"221295248","PubMed":"32708755"},"title":"The Yin and Yang of ACE/ACE2 Pathways: The Rationale for the Use of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors in COVID-19 Patients","abstract":"The article describes the rationale for inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathways as specific targets in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in order to prevent positive feedback-loop mechanisms.

The current SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic has caused more than 2,000,000 infections globally and nearly 200,000 deaths. Coronaviruses enter susceptible cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus into endosomes. Previous results with SARS and MERS CoV have shown that the Spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity and immunogenicity. Herein, we show that expression of SARS CoV-2 S (S-n) glycoprotein after transient transfection of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells caused extensive cell fusion in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S (S-o) glycoprotein. S-n expression was detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces and caused the formation of very large multinucleated cells (syncytia) by 48 hours post transfection. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. This differential S-n versus S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs for ability to inhibit S-n and S-o cell fusion revealed that the FDA approved HIV-protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n and S-o-mediated cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of cell fusion was observed at a 10 micromolar concentration. Computational modeling and in silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n and S-o-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir mesylate acts on cellular processes to inhibit S proteolytic processing. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate as an antiviral drug, especially at early times after SARS-CoV-2 symptoms appear.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This differential S-n versus S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":500,"details":{"paperId":"bb38033790c1283fa4a4d2c558ae1d224cbcc53d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3134967235","PubMedCentral":"8039806","DOI":"10.1007/s11224-021-01776-0","CorpusId":"232415570","PubMed":"33867777"},"title":"The binding mechanism of ivermectin and levosalbutamol with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Investigation of the binding mechanism of two FDA-approved drugs with the spike protein of SARs-CoV-2 reveals that ivermectin is more stable than levosalbutamol in the active site of spike protein where hACE2 binds, and can be a suitable inhibitor for SARS-Cov-2 to enter into the human cell through hace2."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":787,"details":{"paperId":"fe47a450ebcbc1e5b35999ca2816606850f0b14b","externalIds":{"MAG":"3107242038","PubMedCentral":"7698684","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.080","CorpusId":"227188752","PubMed":"33303190"},"title":"The biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein: multiple targets for host-directed antiviral therapy","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The spike glycoprotein, a component of the viral envelope that decorates the virion surface as a distinctive crown (“corona”) and is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":688,"details":{"paperId":"5ad42051521231441f2fcb0fb078d18dcc80cee6","externalIds":{"MAG":"3046200943","PubMedCentral":"7392080","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104902","CorpusId":"220871920","PubMed":"32739404"},"title":"The chemokine receptor antagonist cenicriviroc inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"CVC was examined for its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, in cell cultures and found to be a selective inhibitor of the virus."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1830,"details":{"paperId":"1dffa94063c401720527166e25c16514dd1ec544","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7416714","MAG":"3048213904","DOI":"10.1016/j.redox.2020.101682","CorpusId":"221090881","PubMed":"32810737"},"title":"The cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and is markedly decreased in COVID-19 patients","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In vitro inhibitory activity of the redox active oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol is reported against SARS-CoV-2 and against one of the common cold agents H coV-OC43 human coronavirus without significant cytotoxicity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":359,"details":{"paperId":"370668c7a502c8ed7174cbc3c436e8281cf73273","externalIds":{"MAG":"3017355196","PubMedCentral":"7264624","DOI":"10.1002/rth2.12349","CorpusId":"218793524","PubMed":"32542210"},"title":"The contact activation system as a potential therapeutic target in patients with COVID‐19","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is predicted to overwhelm health care capacity in the United States and worldwide, and, as such, interventions that could prevent clinical decompensation and respiratory compromise in infected patients are desperately needed. Excessive cytokine release and activation of coagulation appear to be key drivers of COVID‐19 pneumonia and associated mortality. Contact activation has been linked to pathologic upregulation of both inflammatory mediators and coagulation, and accumulating preclinical and clinical data suggest it to be a rational therapeutic target in patients with COVID‐19. Pharmacologic inhibition of the interaction between coagulation factors XI and XII has been shown to prevent consumptive coagulopathy, pathologic systemic inflammatory response, and mortality in at least 2 types of experimental sepsis.

Repurposing drugs that have shown promise in inhibiting other viral infections could allow for more rapid dispensation of urgently needed therapeutics. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is extensively glycosylated with 22 occupied N glycan sites and is required for viral entry. In other glycosylated viral proteins, glycosylation is required for interaction with calnexin and chaperone-mediated folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, and prevention of this interaction leads to unfolded viral proteins and thus inhibits viral replication. As such, we investigated two iminosugars, celgosivir, a pro-drug of castanospermine, and UV-4, or N-(9-methoxynonyl)-1-deoxynojirimycin, a deoxynojirimycin derivative. Iminosugars are known inhibitors of the α-glucosidase I and II enzymes and were effective at inhibiting authentic SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in a cell culture system. Celgosivir prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death and reduced viral replication and Spike protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in culture with Vero E6 cells. Castanospermine, the active form of celgosivir, was also able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, confirming the canonical castanospermine mechanism of action of celgosivir. The monocyclic UV-4 also prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced death and reduced viral replication after 24 hours of treatment, although the reduction in viral copies was lost after 48 hours. Our findings suggest that iminosugars should be urgently investigated as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Two iminosugars,

SARS-CoV-2 infects ACE2-expressing cells and gains cell entry through either direct plasma membrane fusion or endocytosis. Recent studies have shown that in addition to ACE2, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) also play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 cell attachment by serving as an attachment factor. Binding of viral spike protein to HSPGs leads to the enrichment of local concentration for the subsequent specific binding with ACE2. We therefore hypothesize that blocking the interactions between viral spike protein and the HSPGs will lead to inhibition of viral replication. In this study, we report our findings of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity and the mechanism of action of lactoferrin (LF) against multiple common human coronaviruses as well as SARS-CoV-2. Our study has shown that LF has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E in cell culture, and bovine lactoferrin (BLF) is more potent than human lactoferrin. Mechanistic studies revealed that BLF binds to HSPGs, thereby blocking viral attachment to the host cell. The antiviral activity of BLF can be antagonized by the HSPG mimetic heparin. Combination therapy experiment showed that the antiviral activity of LF is synergistic with remdesivir in cell culture. Molecular modelling suggests that the N-terminal positively charged region in BLF (residues 17-41) confers the binding to HSPGs. Overall, LF appears to be a promising drug candidate for COVID-19 that warrants further investigation.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"LF has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple common human coronaviruses as well as SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture, and bovine lactoferrin (BLF) is more potent than human lact oferrin, and Mechanistic studies revealed that BLF binds to HSPGs, thereby blocking viral attachment to the host cell."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2486,"details":{"paperId":"a9db9f9d8fe167d76c744250a9d9ebf6f3d81b4f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7276960","MAG":"3124182566","DOI":"10.1038/s41419-020-2636-4","CorpusId":"219529064","PubMed":"32513989"},"title":"The inhibition of IL-2/IL-2R gives rise to CD8+ T cell and lymphocyte decrease through JAK1-STAT5 in critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The decrease of CD8+ T cells in critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may be related to the IL-2 signaling pathway, which gives rise to CD8- T cell and lymphocyte decrease through JAK1-STAT5 in critical customers."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":632,"details":{"paperId":"e6de4c34f195908a25e2e9263d4c940a8d71c41b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7094366","MAG":"2055983838","DOI":"10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.027","CorpusId":"26316808","PubMed":"15935325"},"title":"The interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3C-like proteinase and a dimeric inhibitor by capillary electrophoresis","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The ACE method used here could be developed to be an effective and simple way of applying large-scale drug screening and evaluation and reveal that hydrophobic interaction might play major roles, along with electrostatic force, in the binding process."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6422,"details":{"paperId":"c054465f180e391a4dcede022ec8141830fb37ef","externalIds":{"MAG":"3027858755","PubMedCentral":"7250494","DOI":"10.7573/dic.2020-4-14","CorpusId":"219504841","PubMed":"32547625"},"title":"The journey of remdesivir: from Ebola to COVID-19","abstract":"Countries around the world are currently fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Cases with gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to be complicated by liver injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and diarrhea can also lead to electrolyte disturbances, causing nausea and vomiting, headache, fatigue, etc. If not treated in time, coma and circulatory failure may ensue. As SARS-CoV-2 infects the human body through the combination of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract, the mechanism underlying the gastrointestinal symptoms may involve damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotion of the production of inflammatory factors, causing cytokine storms. Indeed, after cells in the lungs become infected by SARS-CoV-2, effector CD4+ T cells reach the small intestine through the gut-lung axis, causing intestinal immune damage and diarrhea; early extensive use of antibacterial and antiviral drugs can also lead to diarrhea in patients. Thus, treatment options for COVID-19 patients should be promptly adjusted when they have gastrointestinal symptoms.

Refractory hypoxemia and myocardial injury have been observed as two of the major causes of fatality in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binding to broadly expressed CD147 receptors on erythrocytes causes oxidative hemolysis that may result in refractory hypoxemia and myocardial injury. Both of these life-threatening conditions are further exacerbated by imbalance in ACE2 from spike (S) protein receptor binding. Dysregulation in the CD147-cyclophilin A signaling pathway, together with altered calcium signaling from SARS-CoV-2 ion channel activities, may contribute to hypercoagulation, thrombosis, and cardiac remodeling resulting in heart failure. Melatonin is an ancient pleiotropic molecule with recognized antioxidant properties that is essential for the protection of erythrocytes from oxidative hemolysis. Found in erythrocytes, melatonin can reverse hemolytic anemia, normalize heme synthesis, restore lymphocytes and platelet counts, and reduce vessel permeability during an acute hemolytic crisis by maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and reduction of oxidative stress. In acute hypoxic conditions, melatonin is cardioprotective via blunting of cardiopulmonary response to hypoxia and suppressing hypoxia pathways. Melatonin normalizes endothelial-dependent nitric oxide production to prevent multiple organ damage from hypercoagulability, thrombosis, and hypertension associated with oxidative hemolysis and ACE2 deficiency, protecting cardiomyocytes from hypertrophy.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that first emerged in late 2019 is responsible for a pandemic of severe respiratory illness. People infected with this highly contagious virus can present with clinically inapparent, mild, or severe disease. Currently, the virus infection in individuals and at the population level is being monitored by PCR testing of symptomatic patients for the presence of viral RNA. There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV-specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (63 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate RBD's performance as an antigen for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) for antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs.

Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission.

Hence, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the currently available data on the therapeutic potential of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 as add on therapy. A total of 629 patients were included in the 4 studies and all were COVID-19 RT-PCR positive. Among them, 397 patients received ivermectin along with usual therapy. The random effect model showed the overall pooled OR to be 0.53 (95%CI: 0.29 to0.96) for the primary outcome (all-cause mortality) which was statistically significant (P=0.04). Similarly, the random effect model revealed that adding ivermectin led to significant clinical improvement compared to usual therapy (OR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.53, P=0.02).  However, this should be inferred cautiously as the quality of evidence is very low.

As endoribonuclease activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response, Nsp15 emerges as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Here we report the first structures with bound nucleotides and show how the enzyme specifically recognizes uridine moiety. In addition to a uridine site we present evidence for a second base binding site that can accommodate any base. The structure with a transition state analog, uridine vanadate, confirms interactions key to catalytic mechanisms. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. This acquired knowledge was instrumental in identifying Tipiracil, an FDA approved drug that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer, as a potential anti-COVID-19 drug. Using crystallography, biochemical, and whole-cell assays, we demonstrate that Tipiracil inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 by interacting with the uridine binding pocket in the enzyme’s active site.

Tocilizumab is an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody. METHODS Patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard care were randomized (2:1) to double-blinded intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo. The primary outcome measure was clinical status on a 7-category ordinal scale at day 28 (1, discharged/ready for discharge; 7, death). RESULTS Overall, 452 patients were randomized; the modified-intention-to-treat population included 294 tocilizumab-treated and 144 placebo-treated patients. Clinical status at day 28 was not statistically significantly improved for tocilizumab versus placebo (P=0.36). Median (95% CI) ordinal scale values at day 28: 1.0 (1.0 to 1.0) for tocilizumab and 2.0 (1.0 to 4.0) for placebo (odds ratio, 1.19 [0.81 to 1.76]). There was no difference in mortality at day 28 between tocilizumab (19.7%) and placebo (19.4%) (difference, 0.3% [95% CI, -7.6 to 8.2]; nominal P=0.94). Median time to hospital discharge was 8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (20.0 and 28.0, respectively; nominal P=0.037; hazard ratio 1.35 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.79]). Median duration of ICU stay was 5.8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (9.8 and 15.5, respectively; nominal P=0.045).

Along with the non-therapeutic preventive measurements, scientific efforts are currently focused, mainly, on the development of vaccines and pharmacological treatment with existing drugs. Summarizing evidences from scientific literatures on the discovery of treatment plan of COVID-19 under a platform would help the scientific community to explore the opportunities in a systematic fashion. Objective The aim of this study is to explore the potential drugs and biomedical entities related to coronavirus related diseases, including COVID-19, that are mentioned on scientific literature through an automated computational approach. Methods We mined the information from publicly available scientific literature and related public resources. Six topic-specific dictionaries, including human genes, human miRNAs, diseases, Protein Databank, drugs, and drug side effects, were integrated to mine all scientific evidence related to COVID-19. We employed an automated literature mining and labeling system through a novel approach to measure the effectiveness of drugs against diseases based on natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and deep learning. We also applied the concept of cosine similarity to confidently infer the associations between diseases and genes. Results Based on the literature mining, we identified 1805 diseases, 2454 drugs, 1910 genes that are related to coronavirus related diseases including COVID-19. Integrating the extracted information, we developed the first knowledgebase platform dedicated to COVID-19, which highlights potential list of drugs and related biomedical entities. For COVID-19, we highlighted multiple case studies on existing drugs along with a confidence score for their applicability in the treatment plan. Based on our computational method, we found Remdesivir, Statins, Dexamethasone, and Ivermectin could be considered as potential effective drugs to improve clinical status and lower mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We also found that Hydroxychloroquine could not be considered as an effective drug for COVID-19. The resulting knowledgebase is made available as an open source tool, named COVID-19Base.

Due to the limited evidence available on the dynamics of the virus and effective treatment options available, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a huge impact in terms of morbidity and mortality. The economic impact is still to be assessed. Aims: The purpose of this article is to review the evidence for the multiple treatment options available, to consider the future of this global pandemic, and to identify some potential options that could revolutionize the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this article underscores the sheer importance of repurposing some of the available antiviral and antimicrobial agents that have long been in use so as to have an effective and expeditious response to this widespread pandemic and the need to conduct a multicenter global randomized controlled trial to find an effective single antiviral agent or a cocktail of available antimicrobial agents. Method: We thoroughly searched and reviewed various case reports, retrospective analyses, and in vitro studies published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar regarding the treatment options used for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 since its outbreak in an attempt to highlight treatments with the most promising results. Conclusion: We are currently facing one of the worst pandemics in history. Although SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a lower mortality rate than are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, its higher infectivity is making it a far more serious threat. Unfortunately, no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 or effective drug regimen for COVID-19 currently exists. Drug repurposing of available antiviral agents may provide a respite; moreover, a cocktail of antiviral agents may be helpful in treating this disease. Here, we have highlighted a few available antimicrobial agents that could be very effective in treating COVID-19; indeed, a number of trials are underway to detect and confirm the efficacy of these agents.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The sheer importance of repurposing some of the available antiviral and antimicrobial agents that have long been in use so as to have an effective and expeditious response to this widespread pandemic is highlighted."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1916,"details":{"paperId":"0a4923167f4afd83726f9acb33eebadc59c4390d","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7194745","MAG":"3016779347","DOI":"10.1016/j.transci.2020.102790","CorpusId":"216646772","PubMed":"32345485"},"title":"Treatment for emerging viruses: Convalescent plasma and COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This report summarizes existing literature around convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option for COVID-19 and suggests that given the lack of information around the natural history of this disease, PRT should be considered to add a layer of safety to protect recipients of convalescence plasma."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":42,"details":{"paperId":"353184b90587ae851d74dced968b1fede60208ba","externalIds":{"MAG":"3013742505","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2020.4783","CorpusId":"214680925","PubMed":"32219428"},"title":"Treatment of 5 Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 With Convalescent Plasma.","abstract":"Importance\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality.

Whether washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) is effective in COVID-19 patients suspected with GMD by restoring gut microbiota is unknown. This study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of WMT in COVID-19 patients suspected with GMD.METHODS: COVID-19 patients suspected with GMD will be randomly divided to receive routine treatment (group A) or receive routine treatment and WMT (group B). The frequency of WMT will be once a day for three consecutive days. Nucleic acid test, imaging examination, and tests related to organ functions, homeostasis, inflammatory response, intestinal barrier function and immunity will be performed at admission, 1, and 2 weeks after treatment and on the day of discharge. The clinical efficacy and safety of WMT in COVD-19 suspected with GMD and the effects of WMT on the organ function, homeostasis, inflammatory response, intestinal barrier function and immunity of the patients will be evaluated. The primary outcome will be the clinical efficacy, as reflected by the SARS-Cov-2 infection status, gastrointestinal symptoms and the recovery of the disease. The secondary outcomes will be the effects of WMT on the organ function, homeostasis, inflammatory response, intestinal barrier function and immunity of the patients, as well as occurrence of adverse events during WMT.DISCUSSION: In the proposed protocol, WMT is expected to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 patients suspected with GMD, and the therapeutic effect is expected to be associated with the improvement of intestinal barrier function, inflammatory response and immunity.

In fact, most neutralizing antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are directed against the Virus-surface exposed spike protein, making it the antigen of choice for use in vaccines and diagnostic tests. In the current pandemic context, global demand for spike proteins has rapidly increased and could exceed hundreds of grams to kilograms annually. Coronavirus spikes are large heavily glycosylated homo-trimeric complexes, with inherent instability. The poor manufacturability now threatens the availability of these proteins for vaccines and diagnostic tests. Here, we outline scalable, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant, and chemically defined processes for the production of two cell-secreted stabilized forms of the trimeric spike proteins (Wuhan and D614G variant). The processes are chemically defined and based on clonal suspension-CHO cell populations and on protein purification via a two-step scalable downstream process. The trimeric conformation was confirmed using electron microscopy and HPLC analysis. Binding to susceptible cells was shown using a virus-inhibition assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for detection of serum SARS-CoV-2-specific-immunoglobulin molecules was found to exceed that of spike fragments (Spike fragment-1, S1 and Receptor Binding Domain, RBD).

Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents. Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells. Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered. GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic. Estradiol, in contrast with testosterone, affects the expression of the majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. Of major concern is the ACE2 and FURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect a broad range of cellular targets in the human body. Infection of immune cells may cause immunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus to secondary targets. Present analyses and numerous observational studies indicate that age-associated vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the high mortality of older adults and the elderly. Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents. In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2054,"details":{"paperId":"202eb4bf8a83f783becfc2189eae8144a8d70f1a","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7211500","MAG":"3023606094","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4","CorpusId":"218571584","PubMed":"32401715"},"title":"Triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3159,"details":{"paperId":"4eee83264a2b08ce3b78b449e37db7126ea58ab9","externalIds":{"MAG":"3025053601","PubMedCentral":"7256354","DOI":"10.1080/07391102.2020.1768150","CorpusId":"218617635","PubMed":"32396773"},"title":"Truncated human angiotensin converting enzyme 2; a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and potent COVID-19 therapeutic agent","abstract":"Abstract The current pandemic of Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is continued to spread globally and no potential drug or vaccine against it is available. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 located on the envelope surface, involve in interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cell surface receptor, followed by entry into the host cell. Thereby, blocking the S glycoprotein through potential inhibitor may interfere its interaction with ACE2 and impede its entry into the host cell. Here, we present a truncated version of human ACE2 (tACE2), comprising the N terminus region of the intact ACE2 from amino acid position 21-119, involved in binding with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed the in-silico potential of tACE2 to compete with intact ACE2 for binding with RBD. The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2. Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in E. coli makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics.

Current evidence suggests that severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with a dysregulated immune response. However, little is known about how the innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral, surface.

Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III interferon (IFN) response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, pretreatment and posttreatment with type I and III IFNs significantly reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures that correlated with upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Combined, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger an IFN response but is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs.

Experimental testing by SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibition assay and antiviral cytopathic effect assays discovered active hits, Boceprevir and Telaprevir (HCV drugs) and Nelfinavir (HIV drug). Specifically, Boceprevir showed strong protease inhibition with micromolar IC50 of 1.42 μM and an antiviral activity with EC50 of 49.89 μM, whereas Telaprevir showed moderate protease inhibition only with an IC50 of 11.47 μM. Nelfinavir solely showed antiviral activity with a micromolar EC50 value of 3.28 μM. Analysis of binding mechanisms of protease inhibitors revealed the role of PPC core anchors.

While the antibody variable domain facilitates antibody binding and the blockade of infection, the constant domain (Fc) mediates cross talk with the innate immune system. The biological activity of the Fc region is controlled genetically via class switch recombination, resulting in the selection of distinct antibody isotypes and subclasses. However, a second modification is made to all antibodies, via post-translational changes in antibody glycosylation. Studies from autoimmunity and oncology have established the role of immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc glycosylation as a key regulator of humoral immune activity. However, a growing body of literature, exploring IgG Fc glycosylation through the lens of infectious diseases, points to the role of inflammation in shaping Fc-glycan profiles, the remarkable immune plasticity in antibody glycosylation across pathogen-exposed populations, the canonical and noncanonical functions of glycans and the existence of antigen-specific control over antibody Fc glycosylation. Ultimately, this work provides critical new insights into the functional roles for antibody glycosylation as well as lays the foundation for leveraging antibody glycosylation to drive prevention or control across diseases.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work provides critical new insights into the functional roles for antibody glycosylation as well as lays the foundation for leveraging antibody gly cosylation to drive prevention or control across diseases."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5985,"details":{"paperId":"e350f3680ffec16bffd11cebb0861fa40003d2fe","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7545009","MAG":"3088233433","DOI":"10.3389/fneur.2020.573356","CorpusId":"221882686","PubMed":"33101181"},"title":"Unfractionated Heparin in SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: Ischemic Stroke Case Report","abstract":"Thromboembolism is a known phenomenon in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The spike protein is processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, and is either internalised or fuses directly with the cell, leading to infection. We identified a human cell line that expresses both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the RT4 urinary bladder transitional carcinoma, and used it to develop a proxy assay for viral interactions with host cells. A tagged recombinant form of the spike protein, containing both the S1 and S2 domains, binds strongly to RT4 cells as determined by flow cytometry. Binding is temperature dependent and increases sharply at 37{degrees}C, suggesting that processing of the spike protein is likely to be important in the interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we used a flow cytometry assay to determine the effect of heparin on spike protein binding to RT4 cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein binding with an IC50 value of <0.05U/ml whereas two low molecular weight heparins were much less effective. This suggests that heparin, particularly unfractionated forms, could be considered to reduce clinical manifestations of COVID-19 by inhibiting continuing viral infection.

Vaccines have been widely considered as part of the exit strategy to enable the return to previous patterns of working, schooling and socializing. Importantly, to effectively control the COVID‐19 pandemic, production needs to be scaled‐up from a small number of preclinical doses to enough filled vials to immunize the world’s population, which requires close engagement with manufacturers and regulators. It will require a global effort to control the virus, necessitating equitable access for all countries to effective vaccines. This review explores the immune responses required to protect against SARS‐CoV‐2 and the potential for vaccine‐induced immunopathology. We describe the profile of the different platforms and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The review also addresses the critical steps between promising preclinical leads and manufacturing at scale. The issues faced during this pandemic and the platforms being developed to address it will be invaluable for future outbreak control. Nine months after the outbreak began we are at a point where preclinical and early clinical data are being generated for the vaccines; an overview of this important area will help our understanding of the next phases.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The immune responses required to protect against SARS‐CoV‐2 and the potential for vaccine‐induced immunopathology are explored and the profile of the different platforms and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are described."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":604,"details":{"paperId":"1fb7d2aa7cd38a0a8f56d3d86d3ef6415cee8c8e","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7237591","DOI":"10.1007/s40121-020-00300-x","CorpusId":"216109305","PubMed":"32328978"},"title":"Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2: Lessons from Other Coronavirus Strains","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The past and ongoing vaccine development efforts for clinically relevant coronavirus strains are reviewed with the intention that this information helps in the development of effective and safe vaccines for COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4858,"details":{"paperId":"dafe58505de3b0221cf5c55c53032092c191894e","externalIds":{"MAG":"3084316452","PubMedCentral":"7482103","DOI":"10.1136/bmjresp-2020-000623","CorpusId":"221614349","PubMed":"32913008"},"title":"Vimentin as a target for the treatment of COVID-19","abstract":"We and others propose vimentin as a possible cellular target for the treatment of COVID-19.

Moreover, the absence of vimentin in mice makes them resistant to lung injury. Since vimentin has a twofold role in the disease, not only being involved in the viral infection but also in the associated life-threatening lung inflammation, the use of vimentin-targeted drugs may offer a synergistic advantage as compared with other treatments not targeting vimentin.

Shrock et al. used a technology known as VirScan to probe the antibody repertoires of hundreds of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and pre–COVID-19 era controls. They identified hundreds of antibody targets, including several antibody epitopes shared by the mild and severe coronaviruses and many specific to SARS-CoV-2. A machine-learning model accurately classified patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and guided the design of an assay for rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. The study also looked at how the antibody response and viral exposure history differ in patients with diverging outcomes, which could inform the production of improved vaccine and antibody therapies. Science, this issue p. eabd4250 Deep serological profiling reveals discriminatory epitopes that could be used for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. INTRODUCTION A systematic characterization of the humoral response to severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epitopes has yet to be performed. This analysis is important for understanding the immunogenicity of the viral proteome and the basis for cross-reactivity with the common-cold coronaviruses. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is notable for its variable course, with some individuals remaining asymptomatic whereas others experience fever, respiratory distress, or even death. A comprehensive investigation of the antibody response in individuals with severe versus mild COVID-19—as well as an examination of past viral exposure history—is needed. RATIONALE An understanding of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving diagnostics and vaccines and gaining insight into variable clinical outcomes. To this end, we used VirScan, a high-throughput method to analyze epitopes of antiviral antibodies in human sera. We supplemented the original VirScan library with additional libraries of peptides spanning the proteomes of SARS-CoV-2 and all other human coronaviruses. These libraries enabled us to precisely map epitope locations and investigate cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus strains. The original VirScan library allowed us to simultaneously investigate antibody responses to prior infections and viral exposure history. RESULTS We screened sera from 232 COVID-19 patients and 190 pre–COVID-19 era controls against the original VirScan and supplemental coronavirus libraries, assaying more than 108 antibody repertoire–peptide interactions. We identified epitopes ranging from “private” (recognized by antibodies in only a small number of individuals) to “public” (recognized by antibodies in many individuals) and detected SARS-CoV-2–specific epitopes as well as those that cross-react with common-cold coronaviruses. Several of these cross-reacting antibodies are present in pre–COVID-19 era samples. We developed a machine learning model that predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity from VirScan data. We used the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides to produce a Luminex-based serological assay, which performed similarly to gold-standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We stratified the COVID-19 patient samples by disease severity and found that patients who had required hospitalization exhibited stronger and broader antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 but weaker overall responses to past infections compared with those who did not need hospitalization. Further, the hospitalized group had higher seroprevalence rates for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1. These findings may be influenced by differences in demographic compositions between the two groups, but they raise hypotheses that may be tested in future studies. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, we precisely mapped 823 distinct epitopes across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome, 10 of which are likely targets of neutralizing antibodies. One cross-reactive antibody epitope in S2 has been previously suggested to be neutralizing and, as it exists in pre–COVID-19 era samples, could affect the severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSION We present a highly detailed view of the epitope landscape within the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. This knowledge may be used to produce diagnostics with improved specificity and can provide a stepping stone to the isolation and functional dissection of both neutralizing antibodies and antibodies that might exacerbate patient outcomes through antibody-dependent enhancement or immune distraction. Our study reveals notable correlations between COVID-19 severity and both viral exposure history and overall strength of the antibody response to past infections. These findings are likely influenced by demographic covariates, but they generate hypotheses that may be tested with larger patient cohorts matched for age, gender, race, and other demographic variables. SARS-CoV-2 epitope mapping. VirScan detects antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients with severe and mild disease. Heatmap color represents the strength of the antibody response in each sample (columns) to each protein (rows, left) or peptide (rows, right). VirScan reveals the precise positions of epitopes, which can be mapped onto the structure of the spike protein (S). Examination of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronavirus sequence conservation explains epitope cross-reactivity.

Understanding humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for improving diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Deep serological profiling of 232 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 190 pre–COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed more than 800 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Preexisting antibodies in controls recognized SARS-CoV-2 ORF1, whereas only COVID-19 patient antibodies primarily recognized spike protein and nucleoprotein. A machine learning model trained on VirScan data predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity; a rapid Luminex-based diagnostic was developed from the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Individuals with more severe COVID-19 exhibited stronger and broader SARS-CoV-2 responses, weaker antibody responses to prior infections, and higher incidence of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1, possibly influenced by demographic covariates. Among hospitalized patients, males produce stronger SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses than females.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A systematic characterization of the humoral response to severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epitopes has yet to be performed, important for understanding the immunogenicity of the viral proteome and the basis for cross-reactivity with the common-cold coronaviruses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2685,"details":{"paperId":"f782ba32b8993fd7381eaa5e0e78567e78ded77f","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41577-020-00480-0","CorpusId":"256744447"},"title":"Viral targets for vaccines against COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"As the world races to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, Dai and Gao highlight which viral targets are best to include in a vaccine and how this impacts the induced immune response and the safety and efficacy of a vaccine."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1200,"details":{"paperId":"c564c48fecb0b26a57b11e4c06702fc12c3f38c4","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7443089","MAG":"3080247409","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173496","CorpusId":"221234858","PubMed":"32841640"},"title":"Viroinformatics approach to explore the inhibitory mechanism of existing drugs repurposed to fight against COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is evident from this structural informatics study that combo of chloroquine + SSAA09E2 with remdesivir or favipiravir could significantly restrain the virus at the entry and replication stage, and drug repurposition is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1196,"details":{"paperId":"4f1ebe79adb858673d7b8d1e4150635cea50b3dd","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7366121","MAG":"3042755482","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173375","CorpusId":"220548295","PubMed":"32682788"},"title":"Virology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and in-line treatment of COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review work highlighted the origin, emergence, structural features, pathogenesis, and clinical features of COVID-19 and discussed the in-line treatment strategies, preventive measures, and vaccines to combat the emergence of CO VID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3165,"details":{"paperId":"832b09fc5fed666fbc5728e03147b49a54d9395d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3035767992","PubMedCentral":"7332875","DOI":"10.1080/07391102.2020.1778536","CorpusId":"219974602","PubMed":"32568013"},"title":"Virtual screening and dynamics of potential inhibitors targeting RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein from SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"Abstract The emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic has led to an outbreak in the world. The SARS-CoV-2 is seventh and latest in coronavirus family with unique exonucleases for repairing any mismatches in newly transcribed genetic material. Therefore, drugs with novel additional mechanisms are required to simultaneously target and eliminate the virus. Thus, a newly deciphered N protein is taken as a target that belongs to SARS-CoV-2. They play a vital role in RNA transcription, viral replication and new virion formation. This study used virtual screening, molecular modeling and docking of the 8987 ligands from Asinex and PubChem databases against this novel target protein. Three hotspot sites having DScore ≥1 (Site 1, Site 2 and Site 3) for ligand binding were selected. Subsequently, high throughput screening, standard precision and extra precision docking process and molecular dynamics concluded three best drugs from two libraries. Two antiviral moieties from Asinex databases (5817 and 6799) have docking scores of −10.29 and −10.156; along with their respective free binding energies (ΔG bind) of −51.96 and −64.36 on Site 3. The third drug, Zidovudine, is from PubChem database with docking scores of −9.75 with its binding free energies (ΔG bind) of −59.43 on Site 3. The RMSD and RMSF were calculated for all the three drugs through molecular dynamics simulation studies for 50 ns. Zidovudine shows a very stable interaction with fluctuation starting at 2.4 Å on 2 ns and remained stable at 3 Å from 13 to 50 ns. Thus, paving the way for further biological validation as a potential treatment. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Potential therapies and prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulphate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulphate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Aim To compare outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients ordered to receive hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc sulphate versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone. Methodology This was a retrospective observational study. Data was collected from medical records for all patients with admission dates ranging from 2 March 2020 through to 11 April 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. The study included patients admitted to any of four acute care NYU Langone Health Hospitals in New York City. Patients included were admitted to the hospital with at least one positive COVID-19 test and had completed their hospitalization. Patients were excluded from the study if they were never admitted to the hospital or if there was an order for other investigational therapies for COVID-19. Results Patients taking zinc sulphate in addition to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (n=411) and patients taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone (n=521) did not differ in age, race, sex, tobacco use or relevant comorbidities. The addition of zinc sulphate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulphate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulphate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95 % CI 1.12–2.09) and reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice among patients who did not require ICU level of care remained significant (OR 0.449, 95 % CI 0.271–0.744).

Preliminary data obtained in studies of properties of recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-γ) that involved patients with community-acquired pneumonia (including bacterial), acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI), influenza and new coronavirus infection have shown promising results.The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of subcutaneous administration of IFN-γ in patients with viral pneumonia on the changes of vital signs and the duration of hospital stay.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nAn open-label, randomized, low-interventional study included patients with moderate new coronavirus infection COVID-19 over 18 years of age of both sexes. IFN-γ 500,000 IU was administered s/c, daily, once a day, during 5 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIFN-y in addition to complex therapy of the disease resulted in more favorable changes in the stabilization of vital signs, as well as in reduced length of fever and hospital stay by 2 days what allows suggesting a positive effect of this substance on the recovery processes in patients with moderate COVID-19. Special emphasis should be made to the fact that patients who received recombinant IFN- γ experienced no progression of respiratory failure and required no transfer to intensive care unit.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThis study confirms earlier obtained data on the positive effect of IFN-y on the rate of clinical stabilization and recovery of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and viral infections. Presented results are limited to a small number of patients; further study of drug properties in post-marketing studies is required.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nProgress in the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19 by adding recombinant IFN-γ to the complex therapy may reasonably expand the range of existing treatment options for this infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Progress in the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19 by adding recombinant IFN-γ to the complex therapy may reasonably expand the range of existing treatment options for this infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4566,"details":{"paperId":"874f738e624863560dc9c6347b08721dad53a727","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8139425","DOI":"10.1126/science.abg9175","CorpusId":"232365935","PubMed":"33766944"},"title":"mRNA vaccination boosts cross-variant neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection","abstract":"Boosterism could save lives Postinfection immune protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection is not fully understood. It will be devastating if waves of new variants emerge that undermine natural immune protection. Stamatatos et al. investigated immune responsiveness 4 to 8 months after previously infected individuals were given a messenger RNA–based vaccine developed for the original Wuhan variant (see the Perspective by Crotty). Before vaccination, postinfection serum antibody neutralization responses to virus variants were variable and weak. Vaccination elevated postinfection serum-neutralizing capacity approximately 1000-fold against Wuhan-Hu-1 and other strains, and serum neutralization against the variant B.1.351 was enhanced. Although responses were relatively muted against the variant, they still showed characteristic memory responses. Vaccination with the Wuhan-Hu-1 variant may thus offer a valuable boost to protective responses against subsequent infection with variant viruses. Science, abg9175, this issue p. 1413; see also abj2258, p. 1392 Previous infection results in enhanced vaccine-induced immune protection against variant B.1.351 and other variants. Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have raised concerns about resistance to neutralizing antibodies elicited by previous infection or vaccination. We examined whether sera from recovered and naïve donors, collected before and after immunizations with existing messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, could neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.351 variants. Prevaccination sera from recovered donors neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351, but a single immunization boosted neutralizing titers against all variants and SARS-CoV-1 by up to 1000-fold. Neutralization was a result of antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain and was not boosted by a second immunization. Immunization of naïve donors also elicited cross-neutralizing responses but at lower titers. Our study highlights the importance of vaccinating both uninfected and previously infected persons to elicit cross-variant neutralizing antibodies.","publicationTypes":["Editorial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study examined whether sera from recovered and naïve donors, collected before and after immunizations with existing messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, could neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2778,"details":{"paperId":"84d324c78bb9a8de3802c4572eec381e9002ca30","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03324-6","CorpusId":"231882728","PubMed":"33567448"},"title":"mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid a potential loss of clinical efficacy."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":299,"details":{"paperId":"3bcbaca33537cf7973112c1e9f854971a3ec3349","externalIds":{"MAG":"3110875071","DOI":"10.1002/jmv.26728","CorpusId":"229173773","PubMed":"33314219"},"title":"mTOR inhibition in COVID‐19: A commentary and review of efficacy in RNA viruses","abstract":"In this commentary, we shed light on the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in viral infections.

COVID‐19 can fuse their envelopes with the host cell membranes and deliver their genetic material. COVID‐19 attacks the respiratory system and stimulates the host inflammatory responses, enhances the recruitment of immune cells, and promotes angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 activities. Patients with confirmed COVID‐19 may have experienced fever, dry cough, headache, dyspnea, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute heart injury. Several strategies such as oxygen therapy, ventilation, antibiotic or antiviral therapy, and renal replacement therapy are commonly used to decrease COVID‐19‐associated mortality. However, these approaches may not be good treatment options. Therefore, the search for an alternative‐novel therapy is urgently important to prevent the disease progression. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a promising strategy for COVID‐19. The design of oligonucleotide against the genetic material of COVID‐19 might suppress virus RNA translation. Several previous studies have shown that host miRNAs play an antiviral role and improve the treatment of patients with COVID‐19. miRNAs by binding to the 3′‐untranslated region (UTR) or 5′‐UTR of viral RNA play an important role in COVID‐19‐host interplay and viral replication. miRNAs interact with multiple pathways and reduce inflammatory biomarkers, thrombi formation, and tissue damage to accelerate the patient outcome.

Unfortunately, severe side effects became overt during these vaccination campaigns: cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST), absolutely rare under normal life conditions, were found as a severe side effect that occured 4-14 days after first vaccinations. Besides CVST, Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis (SVT) was also observed. This type of adverse event has not been observed in the clinical studies of AstraZeneca, and therefore led immediately to a halt in vaccinations in several european countries. These events were mostly associated with thrombocytopenia, and thus, similar to the well-known Heparin-induced thrombo­cytopenia (HIT). Meanwhile, scientists have proposed a mechanism to explain this vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia. However, they do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the late thromboembolic events. Here, we present data that may explain these severe side effects which have been attributed to adenoviral vaccines. According to our results, transcription of wildtype and codon-optimized Spike open reading frames enables alternative splice events that lead to C-terminal truncated, soluble Spike protein variants. These soluble Spike variants may initiate severe side effects when binding to ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in blood vessels.
