However, its mechanism of activity is still not fully understood. ABSTRACT Oncogenic gammaherpesviruses express viral products during latent and lytic infection that block the innate immune response. Previously, we found that Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV/human herpesvirus-8) viral microRNAs (miRNAs) downregulate cholesterol biogenesis, and we hypothesized that this prevents the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a cholesterol derivative. 25HC blocks KSHV de novo infection of primary endothelial cells at a postentry step and decreases viral gene expression of LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen) and RTA. Herein we expanded on this observation by determining transcriptomic changes associated with 25HC treatment of primary endothelial cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We found that 25HC treatment inhibited KSHV gene expression and induced interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and several inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 8 [IL-8], IL-1α). Some 25HC-induced genes were partially responsible for the broadly antiviral effect of 25HC against several viruses. Additionally, we found that 25HC inhibited infection of primary B cells by a related oncogenic virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV/human herpesvirus-4) by suppressing key viral genes such as LMP-1 and inducing apoptosis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that IL-1 and IL-8 pathways were induced by 25HC in both primary endothelial cells and B cells. We also found that the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), which converts cholesterol to 25HC, can be induced by type I interferon (IFN) in human B cell-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We propose a model wherein viral miRNAs target the cholesterol pathway to prevent 25HC production and subsequent induction of antiviral ISGs. Together, these results answer some important questions about a widely acting antiviral (25HC), with implications for multiple viral and bacterial infections. IMPORTANCE A cholesterol derivative, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), has been demonstrated to inhibit infections from widely different bacteria and viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, its mechanism of activity is still not fully understood. In this work, we look at gene expression changes in the host and virus after 25HC treatment to find clues about its antiviral activity. We likewise demonstrate that 25HC is also antiviral against EBV, a common cancer-causing virus. We compared our results with previous data from antiviral screening assays and found the same pathways resulting in antiviral activity.

Symptoms can be as severe as life-threatening colitis. The current study assessed the antipathogenic potential of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), i.e., 2′-O-fucosyllactose (2′FL), lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), and a combination thereof (MIX), against C. difficile ATCC 9689 using in vitro gut models that allowed the evaluation of both direct and, upon microbiota modulation, indirect effects. During a first 48 h fecal batch study, dysbiosis and CDI were induced by dilution of the fecal inoculum. For each of the three donors tested, C. difficile levels strongly decreased (with >4 log CFU/mL) upon treatment with 2′FL, LNnT and MIX versus untreated blanks, coinciding with increased acetate/Bifidobacteriaceae levels. Interindividual differences among donors at an intermediate time point suggested that the antimicrobial effect was microbiota-mediated rather than being a direct effect of the HMOs. During a subsequent 11 week study with the PathogutTM model (specific application of the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®)), dysbiosis and CDI were induced by clindamycin (CLI) treatment. Vancomycin (VNC) treatment cured CDI, but the further dysbiosis of the indigenous microbiota likely contributed to CDI recurrence. Upon co-supplementation with VNC, both 2′FL and MIX boosted microbial activity (acetate and to lesser extent propionate/butyrate). Moreover, 2′FL avoided CDI recurrence, potentially because of increased secondary bile acid production.

Animal model studies showed that gel-formulated 6-TG topically applied to eyes locally infected with HSV-1 could significantly inhibit HSV-1 replication, alleviate virus-induced HSK pathogenesis, and improve eye conditions. ABSTRACT Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects eye corneal tissues leading to herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK), which is one of the leading causes of blindness. Here in our study, we found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a once clinically approved medication for child acute myelogenous leukemia, inhibited multiple strains of HSV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo. 6-TG is more potent than acyclovir (ACV) and ganciclovir (GCV), with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6-TG at 0.104 μM with high stimulation index (SI) (SI = 6,475.48) compared to the IC50 of ACV at 1.253 μM and the IC50 of GCV at 1.257 μM. In addition, 6-TG at 500 μM topically applied to the eyes with HSV-1 infection significantly inhibits HSV-1 replication, alleviates virus-induced HSK pathogenesis, and improves eye conditions. More importantly, 6-TG is effective against ACV-resistant HSV-1 strains, including HSV-1/153 and HSV-1/blue. Knockdown of Rac1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) negatively affected HSV-1 replication, suggesting that Rac1 facilitated HSV-1 replication. Following HSV-1 infection of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs), endogenous Rac1 activity was upregulated by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. We further found that Rac1 was highly expressed in the corneal tissue of HSK patients compared to normal individuals. Mechanistic study showed that 6-TG inhibited HSV-1 replication by targeting Rac1 activity in HSV-1 infected cells, and the Rac1 is critical in the pathogenesis of HSK. Our results indicated that 6-TG is a promising therapeutic molecule for the treatment of HSK.

In addition, we also documented that Rac1 is highly expressed in corneal tissues from HSK patients, indicating that Rac1 is associated with HSK pathogenesis.

ABSTRACT Human parechovirus 3 (HPeV3) infection is associated with sepsis characterized by significant immune activation and subsequent tissue damage in neonates. Strategies to limit infection have been unsuccessful due to inadequate molecular diagnostic tools for early detection and the lack of a vaccine or specific antiviral therapy. Toward the latter, we present a 2.8-Å-resolution structure of HPeV3 in complex with fragments from a neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, AT12-015, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image reconstruction. Modeling revealed that the epitope extends across neighboring asymmetric units with contributions from capsid proteins VP0, VP1, and VP3. Antibody decoration was found to block binding of HPeV3 to cultured cells. Additionally, at high resolution, it was possible to model a stretch of RNA inside the virion and, from this, identify the key features that drive and stabilize protein-RNA association during assembly.

Presently, the significant variants of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging in due course of time with substantial mutations, having the immune escape property. Simultaneously, the vaccination drive against this virus is in progress worldwide. However, vaccine evasion has been noted by some of the newly emerging variants. Our review provides an overview of the emerging variants’ immune escape and vaccine escape ability. We have illustrated a broad view related to viral evolution, variants, and immune escape ability. Subsequently, different immune escape approaches of SARS-CoV-2 have been discussed. Different innate immune escape strategies adopted by the SARS-CoV-2 has been discussed like, IFN-I production dysregulation, cytokines related immune escape, immune escape associated with dendritic cell function and macrophages, natural killer cells and neutrophils related immune escape, PRRs associated immune evasion, and NLRP3 inflammasome associated immune evasion.

In the first infection, after the prebiotic intervention with B-GOS, a lower incidence, duration, and overall severity of the diarrhea (p < 0.05) was observed. In addition, it improved another severity indicator, the fecal weight output, during the diarrhea period (p < 0.05). The second RV infection failed in provoking diarrhea in the groups studied. The immune response during first infection with SA11 was not affected by B-GOS administration and had no impact on second infection, but the prebiotic intervention significantly increased IFN-γ and TNF-α intestinal production after the second infection (p < 0.05).

The majority of diarrhea cases are treated with antimicrobials, which may not be warranted. There is increasing concern related to the use of antimicrobials in food animals due to the emanant development of antimicrobial resistance. Bovine colostrum is densely packed with hundreds of nutrients and bioactives specifically tailored to improve calf health and development. As such, colostrum may have potential to be used an alternative to antimicrobials for the treatment of diarrhea. The objective of this review is to outline the causation and implication of diarrhea in young dairy calves and to explore the benefits of colostrum and its potential use as a therapy and preventative for diarrhea in pre-weaned calves. Abstract Diarrhea is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pre-weaned dairy calves and, as such, represents a significant animal health and welfare concern. Furthermore, digestive disease early in life is associated with several long-term consequences such as reduced growth rate and decreased milk yield during the first lactation, thus generating severe economic losses. The majority of diarrheic cases in young calves are treated with antimicrobials; however, it is necessary to develop alternative treatments, as excessive antimicrobial usage can lead to antimicrobial resistance and can negatively impact the gut microflora of a calf. Bovine colostrum is abundant in immune and bioactive factors that improve immune function and development. This rich and natural combination of immunoglobulins, natural antimicrobial factors, growth factors, anti-inflammatories and nutrients may be an attractive alternative to antimicrobials in the treatment of diarrhea in young dairy calves.

This use is based on extensive findings that ingesting tryptophan increases brain tryptophan concentrations, which stimulates the synthesis and release of the neurotransmitter serotonin, from which it is derived. Such increases in serotonin function may improve mood and sleep. However, tryptophan ingestion has other effects, such as increasing serotonin production in the gut, increasing serotonin concentrations in blood, stimulating the production of the hormone melatonin (a tryptophan metabolite), stimulating tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway, and possibly stimulating the production of tryptophan metabolites in the gut microbiome. Several of the kynurenine metabolites have actions on excitatory glutamate receptors in the gut and brain and on cells of the immune system. In addition, metabolites of tryptophan produced by colonic bacteria are reported to cause adverse effects in some species. This review examines each of these tryptophan pathways to determine if any of the metabolites increase after tryptophan ingestion, and if so, whether effects are seen on target body functions. In this regard, recent research suggests that it may be useful to examine kynurenine pathway metabolites and some microbial tryptophan metabolites to determine whether supplemental tryptophan consumption increases their concentrations in the body and amplifies their actions.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that it may be useful to examine kynurenine pathway metabolites and some microbial tryptophan metabolites to determine whether supplemental tryptophile consumption increases their concentrations in the body and amplifies their actions."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5013,"details":{"paperId":"2ff68b15ccbf23bb283763fe2c46b6d406eba466","externalIds":{"MAG":"2794121729","PubMedCentral":"6067888","DOI":"10.1080/21645515.2018.1450709","CorpusId":"3896386","PubMed":"29543547"},"title":"A Phase 4, multicentre, randomized, single-blind clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity of the live, attenuated, oral rotavirus vaccine (116E), ROTAVAC®, administered simultaneously with or without the buffering agent in healthy infants in India","abstract":"ABSTRACT Background: The World Health Organization recommends that rotavirus vaccines should be included in all national immunization programs. Some currently licensed oral rotavirus vaccines contain a buffering agent (either as part of a ready-to-use liquid formulation or added during reconstitution) to reduce possible degradation of the vaccine virus in the infant gut, which poses several programmatic challenges (the large dose volume or the reconstitution requirement) during vaccine administration. Because ROTAVAC®, a WHO prequalified vaccine, was derived from the 116E neonatal strain, we evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of ROTAVAC® without buffer and ROTAVAC® with buffer in a phase 4, multicentre, single-blind, randomized clinical trial in healthy infants in India. Methods: 900 infants, approximately 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, were assigned to 3 groups to receive ROTAVAC® (0.5 mL dose) orally: (i) 2.5 mL of citrate-bicarbonate buffer 5 minutes prior to administration of ROTAVAC® (Group I), (ii) ROTAVAC®, alone, without any buffer (Group II), or (iii) ROTAVAC®, mixed with buffer immediately before administration (Group III). Non–inferiority was compared among the groups for differences in serological responses (detected by serum anti-rotavirus IgA) and safety. Results: Geometric mean titers post vaccination at day 84 (28 days after dose 3) were 19.6 (95%CI: 17.0, 22.7), 20.7 (95%CI: 17.9, 24) and 19.2 (95%CI: 16.8, 22.1) for groups I, II and III respectively. Further, seroconversion rates and distribution of adverse events were similar among groups.

Some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), bind to heparan sulfate, whereas others, such as influenza A virus (IAV), bind to sialic acid. Receptor mimetics that interfere with these interactions are active against viruses that bind to either heparan sulfate or to sialic acid. However, no molecule that inhibits the attachment of viruses in both groups has yet been identified. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea catechin, is active against many unrelated viruses, including several that bind to heparan sulfate or to sialic acid. We sought to identify the basis for the broad-spectrum activity of EGCG. Here, we show that EGCG inhibits the infectivity of a diverse group of enveloped and nonenveloped human viruses. EGCG acts directly on the virions, without affecting the fluidity or integrity of the virion envelopes. Instead, EGCG interacts with virion surface proteins to inhibit the attachment of HSV-1, HCV, IAV, vaccinia virus, adenovirus, reovirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) virions. We further show that EGCG competes with heparan sulfate for binding of HSV-1 and HCV virions and with sialic acid for binding of IAV virions. Therefore, EGCG inhibits unrelated viruses by a common mechanism. Most importantly, we have identified EGCG as the first broad-spectrum attachment inhibitor. Our results open the possibility for the development of small molecule broad-spectrum antivirals targeting virion attachment.

This is due to the fact that AAV vectors, that can provide long-term expression of recombinant genes, have shown an excellent safety profile, and can accommodate genes for one or several nanobodies. In fact, several studies showed that AAV vectors can provide sustained nanobody expression both locally or systemically in preclinical models of human diseases. Some of the pathologies addressed with this technology include cancer, neurological, cardiovascular, infectious, and genetic diseases. Depending on the indication, AAV-delivered nanobodies can be expressed extracellularly or inside cells. Intracellular nanobodies or “intrabodies” carry out their function by interacting with cell proteins involved in disease and have also been designed to help elucidate cellular mechanisms by interfering with normal cell processes.

In many cases, these variations are due to viruses switching their specificity from one cell surface receptor to another. The structural requirements that underlie such receptor switching are not well understood especially for carbohydrate-binding viruses, as methods capable of structure-specificity studies are only relatively recently being developed for carbohydrates. We have characterized the receptor specificity, structure and infectivity of the human polyomavirus BKPyV, the causative agent of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, and uncover a molecular switch for binding different carbohydrate receptors. We show that the b-series gangliosides GD3, GD2, GD1b and GT1b all can serve as receptors for BKPyV. The crystal structure of the BKPyV capsid protein VP1 in complex with GD3 reveals contacts with two sialic acid moieties in the receptor, providing a basis for the observed specificity. Comparison with the structure of simian virus 40 (SV40) VP1 bound to ganglioside GM1 identifies the amino acid at position 68 as a determinant of specificity. Mutation of this residue from lysine in BKPyV to serine in SV40 switches the receptor specificity of BKPyV from GD3 to GM1 both in vitro and in cell culture.

Areas covered: We reviewed U.S. data on coverage, vaccine effectiveness (VE), and vaccine impact from 2006 to 2017. National rotavirus vaccine coverage estimates increased since vaccine introduction but plateaued at 71–75% in 2013–2015, a level 15–20% lower than that of other routine childhood vaccines.

The novel structures exhibit general formulas with hexose vs. hexosamine contents of 5/2 to 8/2 and can be designated as high-galactose (HG)-HMOs. In addition, up to three fucosyl residues are linked to the octa- to dodecasaccharides, which were detected in two human milk samples from Lewis blood group defined donors. Structural analyses of methylated glycans and their alditols comprised MALDI mass spectrometry, ESI-(CID)MS and linkage analyses by GC-MS of the derived partially methylated alditol acetates.

Studies have demonstrated that PAP also depurinates other RNA templates, such as Human immunodeficiency virus-1 RNA and Brome mosaic virus RNAs. However, the mechanism by which PAP accesses viral RNAs is not known. Considering that PAP was shown recently to bind the m(7)G of the cap structure, we speculated that PAP may interact with other factors involved in translation initiation. By far western analysis, we show that PAP binds specifically to eIF4G and eIFiso4G of wheat germ and analysis with truncation mutants of eIFiso4G indicates that a region of this protein, between amino acids 511 and 624, is required for PAP binding activity. The yeast two-hybrid system supports these results by showing reduced growth and alpha-galactosidase expression with truncation in this region of eIFiso4G. PAP binds m(7)GTP-Sepharose and this interaction does not diminish the binding of PAP to purified eIFiso4G, indicating that a complex can form among the cap structure, PAP and eIFiso4G.

Upon virus infection, interferons (IFNs) generate the initial signals for cellular defenses. Knowing that defects in IFN signaling are associated with more severe COVID-19, Wickenhagen et al. used IFN-stimulated gene expression screening on human lung cells from which they identified a gene for 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) (see the Perspective by Schoggins). OAS1 stimulates RNase L to inhibit the virus with a surprising degree of specificity, targeting the membranous organelles in which it replicates. In most mammals, OAS1 is attached to membranes by a prenyl group. However, billions of humans do not have the prenylated OAS1 haplotype, including many experiencing severe COVID-19. The same is true for horseshoe bats, prolific sources of betacoronaviruses, because of an ancient retrotransposition event. —CA A component of the human interferon system that activates SARS-CoV-2 cellular defenses appears to be defective in a large proportion of humans. INTRODUCTION Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that are rapidly deployed in response to invading pathogens. By initiating a signaling cascade that stimulates the expression of hundreds of genes, IFNs create an antiviral state in host cells. Because IFNs heavily influence COVID-19 outcomes, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication can be inhibited by the antiviral state, it is important to understand how the individual antiviral effectors encoded by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) inhibit SARS-CoV-2. RATIONALE We hypothesized that IFN-stimulated antiviral effectors can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, and that variation at the loci encoding these defenses underlies why some people are more susceptible to severe COVID-19. RESULTS We used arrayed ISG expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) consistently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in different contexts. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we found that endogenous OAS1 makes a substantial contribution to the antiviral state by recognizing short stretches of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and activating RNase L. We globally mapped where OAS1 binds to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs and found that OAS1 binding is remarkably specific, with two conserved stem loops in the SARS-CoV-2 5′-untranslated region (UTR) constituting the principal viral target. OAS1 expression was readily detectable at the sites of infection in individuals who died of COVID-19, and specific OAS1 alleles are known to be associated with altered susceptibility to infection and severe disease. It had previously been reported that alleles containing a common splice-acceptor single nucleotide polymorphism in OAS1 (Rs10774671) were associated with less severe COVID-19. We determined that people with at least one allele with a G at this position could express a prenylated form of OAS1 (p46), whereas other individuals could not. Using a series of mutants, we found that C-terminal prenylation was necessary for OAS1 to initiate a block to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, confocal microscopy revealed that prenylation targeted OAS1 to perinuclear structures rich in viral dsRNA, whereas non-prenylated OAS1 was diffusely localized and unable to initiate a detectable block to SARS-CoV-2 replication. The realization that prenylation is essential for OAS1-mediated sensing of SARS-CoV-2 allowed us to examine the transcriptome of infected patients and investigate whether there was a link between the expression of prenylated OAS1 and SARS-CoV-2 disease progression. Analysis of the OAS1 transcripts from 499 hospitalized COVID-19 patients revealed that expressing prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19. Because prenylated OAS1 was so important in human cases, we wanted to determine whether horseshoe bats, the likely source of SARS-CoV-2, possessed the same defense. When we examined the genomic region where the prenylation signal should reside, retrotransposition of a long terminal repeat sequence had ablated this signal, preventing the expression of prenylated anti-CoV OAS1 in these bats. CONCLUSION C-terminal prenylation targets OAS1 to intracellular sites rich in viral dsRNA, which are likely the SARS-CoV-2 replicative organelles. Once in the right place, OAS1 binds to dsRNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 5′-UTR and initiates a potent block to SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, the correct targeting of OAS1 and the subsequent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 likely underpins the genetic association of alleles containing a G at Rs10774671 with reduced susceptibility to infection and severe disease in COVID-19. Moreover, the conspicuous absence of this antiviral defense in horseshoe bats potentially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is so sensitive to this defense in humans. Location, location, location, and dsRNA sensing. A common genetic polymorphism determines whether people make a membrane-associated form of OAS1, a dsRNA sensor. Prenylation targets OAS1 to sites rich in viral dsRNA. Once in the correct place, OAS1 senses dsRNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 5′-UTR and initiates a potent block to SARS-CoV-2 replication. OAS1 based on PDB ID 4IG8. Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is hypothesized that IFN-stimulated antiviral effectors can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, and that variation at the loci encoding these defenses underlies why some people are more susceptible to severe COVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2599,"details":{"paperId":"e09acef8f6211b0858c9304fe17635a16a51df99","externalIds":{"MAG":"2079154240","DOI":"10.1016/J.JMB.2007.09.053","CorpusId":"5745476","PubMed":"17950312"},"title":"A protein silencing switch by ligand-induced proteasome-targeting intrabodies.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that suicide intrabodies are able to redirect the target cellular proteins upon stimulus administration to the proteolytic machinery, thus resulting in selective protein knock-down, and should allow the large-scale investigation of intracellular protein networks."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3174,"details":{"paperId":"73daaaf3df35e94de442457727a947324261ddea","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"5651219","MAG":"2760380650","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.09.014","CorpusId":"4556395","PubMed":"28967523"},"title":"A randomized Phase III clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a bovine-human reassortant pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in Indian infants","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","ClinicalTrial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The Pentavalent reassortant rotavirus vaccine showed excellent tolerability and a good safety profile when tested for efficacy in infants and the intent to treat analyses confirmed all the per protocol analyses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6378,"details":{"paperId":"99472802c0c2f6e2fd35172acfbf1a5268ca68ed","externalIds":{"MAG":"3026601629","DOI":"10.1111/pai.13276","CorpusId":"218689445","PubMed":"32426882"},"title":"A randomized controlled trial of different young child formulas on upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections in Chinese toddlers","abstract":"Bioactive proteins and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), important ingredients in breast milk, that protect against infections are lacking in young child formula (YCF).

However, there is increasing concern about whether this is the optimal point to begin treatment or whether it is better to delay the initiation to more advanced stages.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo study the immunological and virological benefits of starting antiretroviral therapy at these early stages.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 161 HIV-infected asymptomatic patients with CD4 cell count > 500 x 10(6) cells/l and viral load > 10000 copies/ml were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups: no treatment, twice daily zidovudine and thrice daily zalcitabine (ZDV-ddC), twice daily zidovudine and didanosine (ZDV-ddI), twice daily stavudine and didanosine (D4T-ddI), or a twice daily three-drug regimen with stavudine and lamivudine and ritonavir. The endpoints were progression to < 350 x 10(6) cells/l CD4 cells, to < 500 x 10(6) cells/l with either two Centers for Disease Control class B symptoms or an increase of viral load > 0.5 log10 copies/ml above baseline, or to AIDS or death. In various substudies, the lymphoid tissue and cerebrospinal fluid viral load, development of genotypic resistance, proliferative responses to mitogens and cytomegalovirus, and HIV-1 specific antigens and other immunophenotypic markers were also analysed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nProgression rates to study endpoints within 1 year were greater in the control group (31%) than in all groups receiving antiretroviral therapy pooled together (5%; estimated hazard ratio 7.41; 95% confidence interval 5.72-74.55; P < 0.001). The peak mean viral load decrease was greater in the three-drug group when compared with any of the three groups with a two-drug regimen (2.32, 1.65, 1.72 and 1.84, respectively; P < or = 0.001). At 1 year, viral load remained below 20 copies/ml in 30 out of 33 patients in the three-drug group (91%) and in only eight out of 94 patients (9%) in two-drug groups (P = 0.001). The peak mean increase in CD4 cells was also greater in the three-drug group than in the double treatment arms (259 versus 85, 144 and 145 x 10(6) cells/l, respectively; P = 0.001). By comparison, 36% of patients in the three-drug group regimen had to change the therapy as a result of adverse events. Substudies were performed in 60 patients recruited at two sites. Tonsillar tissue HIV RNA was measured in seven patients (two in the two-drug groups and five in the three-drug group) in whom plasma HIV RNA was < 20 copies/ml at 1 year. It was 15151 and 133333 copies/mg tissue in the two patients from the two-drug group, < 40 copies/mg tissue in four patients in the three-drug group, and 485 copies/mg in one patient in the three-drug group. At 1 year there was a mean increase of 4.21+/-2.94% in CD8+CD38+ cells in the control group and a decrease of 9.48+/-3.36% in the two-drug groups (P = 0.01), and 19.87+/-3.64 in the three-drug group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.05, for comparisons with control group and two-drug groups, respectively). Although proliferative responses to cytomegalovirus antigens were significantly greater in those receiving antiretroviral therapy, response to HIV-1 p24 antigen was not detected in any patient in either treatment group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study supports the recommendation to start antiretroviral therapy with a three-drug combination during very early stages of HIV-1 disease, at least if viral load is above a cut-off point (10000 copies/ml in our study). The risk of progression was sevenfold higher in non-treated patients at 8 months of follow-up. Some immune system parameters improved toward normal values after 1 year of antiretroviral therapy, but the proliferative response of CD4 T lymphocytes against the p24 HIV-1 antigen was not recovered.

Combined knock down of chaperones or AR‐12 treatment acted to reduce the expression of virus receptors and essential glucosidase proteins. Combined knock down of chaperones or AR‐12 treatment inactivated mTOR and elevated ATG13 S318 phosphorylation concomitant with inducing an endoplasmic reticulum stress response that in an eIF2α—dependent fashion increased Beclin1 and LC3 expression and autophagosome formation. Over‐expression of chaperones prevented the reduction in receptor/glucosidase expression, mTOR inactivation, the ER stress response, and autophagosome formation. AR‐12 reduced the reproduction of viruses including Mumps, Influenza, Measles, Junín, Rubella, HIV (wild type and protease resistant), and Ebola, an effect replicated by knock down of multiple chaperone proteins. AR‐12—stimulated the co‐localization of Influenza, EBV and HIV virus proteins with LC3 in autophagosomes and reduced viral protein association with the chaperones HSP90, HSP70, and GRP78. Knock down of Beclin1 suppressed drug‐induced autophagosome formation and reduced the anti‐viral protection afforded by AR‐12. In an animal model of hemorrhagic fever virus, a transient exposure of animals to low doses of AR‐12 doubled animal survival from ∼30% to ∼60% and suppressed liver damage as measured by ATL, GGT and LDH release. Thus through inhibition of chaperone protein functions; reducing the production, stability and processing of viral proteins; and stimulating autophagosome formation/viral protein degradation, AR‐12 acts as a broad‐specificity anti‐viral drug in vitro and in vivo.

In the present study, we evaluated if AAV manipulates the UPR pathways during its infection. We first examined the role of the three major UPR axes, namely, endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in AAV infected cells. Total RNA from mock or AAV infected HeLa cells were used to determine the levels of 8 different ER-stress responsive transcripts from these pathways. We observed a significant up-regulation of IRE1α (up to 11 fold) and PERK (up to 8 fold) genes 12–48 hours after infection with self-complementary (sc)AAV2 but less prominent with single-stranded (ss)AAV2 vectors. Further studies demonstrated that scAAV1 and scAAV6 also induce cellular UPR in vitro, with AAV1 vectors activating the PERK pathway (3 fold) while AAV6 vectors induced a significant increase on all the three major UPR pathways [6–16 fold]. These data suggest that the type and strength of UPR activation is dependent on the viral capsid. We then examined if transient inhibition of UPR pathways by RNA interference has an effect on AAV transduction. siRNA mediated silencing of PERK and IRE1α had a modest effect on AAV2 and AAV6 mediated gene expression (∼1.5–2 fold) in vitro. Furthermore, hepatic gene transfer of scAAV2 vectors in vivo, strongly elevated IRE1α and PERK pathways (2 and 3.5 fold, respectively). However, when animals were pre-treated with a pharmacological UPR inhibitor (metformin) during scAAV2 gene transfer, the UPR signalling and its subsequent inflammatory response was attenuated concomitant to a modest 2.8 fold increase in transgene expression. Collectively, these data suggest that AAV vectors activate the cellular UPR pathways and their selective inhibition may be beneficial during AAV mediated gene transfer.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"AAV vectors activate the cellular UPR pathways and their selective inhibition may be beneficial during AAV mediated gene transfer, and the type and strength of UPR activation is dependent on the viral capsid."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3198,"details":{"paperId":"8e1e50bef7e54b047a5ba0717ece0f4f7d1aaa89","externalIds":{"MAG":"3005545953","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.098","CorpusId":"211158224","PubMed":"32067818"},"title":"Acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations after implementation of universal mass vaccination against rotavirus.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"RV UMV lead to immediate and sustainable reduction of hospitalizations due to RVGE in children aged <4 years and reduction of overall AGE accompanied with the decrease in the severity of hospitalized children."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8612,"details":{"paperId":"b5841aae2757b6f7652cf614c3e671abe9537f9b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2073384113","DOI":"10.1517/14656566.8.11.1651","CorpusId":"42975824","PubMed":"17685883"},"title":"Acute infectious pediatric gastroenteritis: beyond oral rehydration therapy","abstract":"Worldwide diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality.

Its utility is limited by systemic toxicity and dose-dependent pneumonitis able to progress to lung fibrosis. The latter can affect up to nearly 50% of the total patient population, out of which 3% will die. We propose to improve BLM delivery by tethering it to an efficient delivery vector. Adenovirus (Ad) dodecahedron base (DB) is a particulate vector composed of 12 copies of a pentameric viral protein responsible for virus penetration. The vector efficiently penetrates the plasma membrane, is liberated in the cytoplasm and has a propensity to concentrate around the nucleus; up to 300000 particles can be observed in one cell in vitro. Principal Findings Dodecahedron (Dd) structure is preserved at up to about 50°C at pH 7–8 and during dialysis, freezing and drying in the speed-vac in the presence of 150 mM ammonium sulfate, as well as during lyophilization in the presence of cryoprotectants. The vector is also stable in human serum for 2 h at 37°C. We prepared a Dd-BLM conjugate which upon penetration induced death of transformed cells. Similarly to free bleomycin, Dd-BLM caused dsDNA breaks. Significantly, effective cytotoxic concentration of BLM delivered with Dd was 100 times lower than that of free bleomycin.

Once detected, these receptors flood the cell with cytokines and IFNs that not only help to eradicate the invading viruses but also activate the adaptive immune response. Owing to difficulties in viral detection, a whole class of TLRs is dedicated to sensing viral nucleic acids, while other TLRs detect viral coat proteins and aid in establishing antiviral immunity. To protect humans better, TLRs and their downstream mediators can be used as potential drug targets, which can be either activated or inhibited, to counter viral infections. Areas covered: The current review focuses on TLR-targeting investigational drugs developed to treat viral diseases and virus-induced complications. Expert opinion: TLRs are a good choice for eradicating viral infections because they can fine-tune the immune response. However, TLRs should be exploited carefully, as there have been instances where their activation has led to unwanted responses in terms of both immune and viral activation. Therefore, more focus should be placed on novel drugs that can induce significant and long-term immunity, while concomitantly alleviating side effects.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Toll-like receptors are a good choice for eradicating viral infections because they can fine-tune the immune response, but more focus should be placed on novel drugs that can induce significant and long-term immunity, while concomitantly alleviating side effects."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4883,"details":{"paperId":"03e9b2bcf6e22e0164029796e4d3e38e5e3b953a","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1074/mcp.R119.001836","CorpusId":"231623103","PubMed":"33451384"},"title":"Advances in Tools to Determine the Glycan-Binding Specificities of Lectins and Antibodies.","abstract":"Proteins that bind carbohydrate structures can serve as tools to quantify or localize specific glycans in biological specimens.

The contamination of foods can occur during production, preparation, and/or service, or, more rarely by contamination of water supply. Contamination of water supply with norovirus is rare, and usually occurs as a consequence of leakage of sewage or as a result of leaching after heavy rainfall. Outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis associated with contaminated food and water can have high impact as a large number of individuals can become affected quickly over a large geographical area, with a high number of secondary cases. However, adequate capture of both epidemiological and laboratory data of norovirus outbreaks remains a major challenge, as many outbreaks fail to be identified and/ or followed up and so the incidence of norovirus-associated foodborne outbreaks is not well defined. Measures for preventing norovirus contamination are centred on good hand hygiene and environmental cleaning practices in healthcare settings, food establishments and on board cruise ships. Several guidelines for responding to outbreaks in food preparation premises are available, and there is a wide range of generic legislation for food processing and handling. There is currently no licenced vaccine or antiviral drug for prophylaxis or treatment of norovirus. However, the first trial demonstrating homologous protection against illness and infection using a norovirus VLP (virus-like particle) was reported recently.

Niclosamide may also be effective for the treatment of viral respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza. While systemic application of niclosamide may lead to unwanted side effects, local administration via aerosol may circumvent these problems, particularly when the drug is encapsulated into small polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrospheres. In the present study, we examined whether PEG-encapsulated niclosamide inhibits the production of mucus and affects the pro-inflammatory mediator CLCA1 in mouse airways in vivo, while effects on mucociliary clearance were assessed in excised mouse tracheas. The potential of encapsulated niclosamide to inhibit TMEM16A whole-cell Cl− currents and intracellular Ca2+ signalling was assessed in airway epithelial cells in vitro. We achieved encapsulation of niclosamide in PEG-microspheres and PEG-nanospheres (Niclo-spheres). When applied to asthmatic mice via intratracheal instillation, Niclo-spheres strongly attenuated overproduction of mucus, inhibited secretion of the major proinflammatory mediator CLCA1, and improved mucociliary clearance in tracheas ex vivo. These effects were comparable for niclosamide encapsulated in PEG-nanospheres and PEG-microspheres. Niclo-spheres inhibited the Ca2+ activated Cl− channel TMEM16A and attenuated mucus production in CFBE and Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. Both inhibitory effects were explained by a pronounced inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ signals.

The pineal gland is highly susceptible to environmental toxicants. Two pervasive substances in modern industrialized nations are aluminum and glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup?. In this paper, we show how these two toxicants work synergistically to induce neurological damage. Glyphosate disrupts gut bacteria, leading to an overgrowth of Clostridium difficile. Its toxic product, p-cresol, is linked to autism in both human and mouse models. p-Cresol enhances uptake of aluminum via transferrin. Anemia, a result of both aluminum disruption of heme and impaired heme synthesis by glyphosate, leads to hypoxia, which induces increased pineal gland transferrin synthesis. Premature birth is associated with hypoxic stress and with substantial increased risk to the subsequent development of autism, linking hypoxia to autism. Glyphosate chelates aluminum, allowing ingested aluminum to bypass the gut barrier. This leads to anemia-induced hypoxia, promoting neurotoxicity and damaging the pineal gland. Both glyphosate and aluminum disrupt cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in melatonin metabolism. Furthermore, melatonin is derived from tryptophan, whose synthesis in plants and microbes is blocked by glyphosate. We also demonstrate a plausible role for vitamin D3 dysbiosis in impaired gut function and impaired serotonin synthesis.

In order to develop such an alternative therapy, the effectiveness of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to produce and display a VHH antibody fragment (referred to as anti-rotavirus protein 1 [ARP1]) on the surface was investigated. L. rhamnosus GG is one of the best-characterized probiotic bacteria and has intrinsic antirotavirus activity. Among four L. rhamnosus GG strains [GG (CMC), GG (ATCC 53103), GG (NCC 3003), and GG (UT)] originating from different sources, only GG (UT) was able to display ARP1 on the bacterial surface. The genomic analysis of strain GG (UT) showed that the genes welE and welF of the EPS cluster are inactivated, which causes a defect in exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, allowing efficient display of ARP1 on its surface. Finally, GG (UT) seemed to confer a level of protection against rotavirus-induced diarrhea similar to that of wild-type GG (NCC 3003) in a mouse pup model, indicating that the EPS may not be involved in the intrinsic antirotavirus activity. Most important, GG (EM233), a derivative of GG (UT) producing ARP1, was significantly more protective than the control strain L. casei BL23.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"GG (UT) seemed to confer a level of protection against rotavirus-induced diarrhea similar to that of wild-type GG (NCC 3003) in a mouse pup model, indicating that the EPS may not be involved in the intrinsic antirotavirus activity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5641,"details":{"paperId":"41d5e52ebbfe8658652d835f1eb405e7d1ff0eb2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2014313134","DOI":"10.1097/MPG.0000000000000806","CorpusId":"39451918","PubMed":"25844707"},"title":"An Opinion on “Staging” of Infant Formula: A Developmental Perspective on Infant Feeding","abstract":"Abstract Breast milk is a dynamic fluid with compositional changes occurring throughout the period of lactation. Some of these changes in nutrient concentrations reflect the successively slowing growth rate and developmental changes in metabolic requirements that infants undergo during the first year of life. Infant formula, in contrast, has a static composition, intended to meet the nutritional requirements of infants from birth to 6 or 12 months of age. To better fit the metabolic needs of infants and to avoid nutrient limitations or excesses, we suggest that infant formulas should change in composition with the age of the infant, that is, different formulas are created/used for different ages during the first year of life. We propose that specific formulas for 0 to 3 months (stage 1), 3 to 6 months (stage 2), and 6 to 12 months (stage 3) of age may be nutritionally and physiologically advantageous to infants. Although this initially may impose some difficult practical/conceptual issues, we believe that this staging concept would improve nutrition of formula-fed infants and, ultimately, improve outcomes and make their performance more similar to that of breast-fed infants.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is proposed that specific formulas for 0 to 3 months, 3 to 6 months, and 6 to 12 months of age of age may be nutritionally and physiologically advantageous to infants."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3051,"details":{"paperId":"3ba3c45671e81c6a89cae881b6f280e2bec1a67b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2070740077","DOI":"10.1016/J.TETASY.2005.01.035","CorpusId":"85183720"},"title":"An approach towards the synthesis of sialyl nucleoside mimetics","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8081,"details":{"paperId":"1bf687a1cea860ae7f2050cf077afe98da7146d0","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1186/s12929-022-00794-2","CorpusId":"255864981"},"title":"An auto-antibody identified from phenotypic directed screening platform shows host immunity against EV-A71 infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The treatment of the identified 07-human IgG1 antibody increased the survival rate after virus challenge, and significantly decreased the viral RNA and the level of neural pathology in brain tissue, and the results indicate that the usage and application of this antibody may offer a potential treatment against EV-A71 infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4516,"details":{"paperId":"835ec415bafcebdc41192b89aea84c9c4c9867f4","externalIds":{"MAG":"2973175176","DOI":"10.1039/c9ob01822k","CorpusId":"203148678","PubMed":"31573016"},"title":"An easily accessible isospiropyran switch.","abstract":"In the presence of SiCl4, three molecules of 5'-bromo-2'-hydroxyacetophenone underwent an unexpected tandem aldol condensation to give a novel isospiropyran switch (69%), with X-ray crystallography confirming its structure.

Three novel ANO1 inhibitors were discovered from screening of 54,400 synthetic small molecules, and they were found to fully block ANO1 channel activity with an IC50 < 3 μM. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that the most potent inhibitor, 2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methylideneamino]-acetamide (Ani9), completely inhibited ANO1 chloride current with submicromolar potency. Notably, unlike previous small-molecule ANO1 inhibitors identified to date, Ani9 displayed high selectivity for ANO1 as compared to ANO2, which shares a high amino acid homology to ANO1.

The viral proteins (VP), especially VP4- and VP7-induced neutralizing antibodies, were considered to be critical in protective immunity to rotavirus disease. However, whether the antibody to rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) protects against rotavirus-induced diarrhea directly is not completely clear, especially for the protective time course. Materials and Methods: To obtain direct evidence, 12-day-old ICR mice were treated with NSP4 and entire rotavirus to induce diarrhea. Results: Both NSP4 and rotavirus-treated mice developed diarrhea, which was accompanied by histological changes in the small intestine compared to age-matched control mice. Anti-NSP4 antibody demonstrated protection against both entire rotavirus-induced diarrhea and NSP4-induced diarrhea. The histological changes in the small intestinal were reversible. These data show that early intervention with anti-NSP4 antibody can prevent rotavirus-induced diarrhea in mice; late intervention with anti-NSP4 antibody could halt diarrhea progression in mice.

Joint therapeutic administration of 2KD1+3B2 (200 μg/dose) successfully reduced diarrhea duration, RVA infection severity and virus shedding in feces. While the same dose of 2KD1 or 3B2 (200 μg) significantly reduced duration of RVA-induced diarrhea, 2KD1 was more effective in diminishing the severity of intestinal infection and RVA shedding in feces, perhaps because 2KD1 presented higher binding affinity for RVA particles than 3B2.

Despite these widely recognized properties, breast-feeding represents an important mother-to-child transmission route of some viral infections. Different studies show that some flaviviruses can occasionally be detected in breast milk, but their transmission to the newborn is still controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the antiviral activity of human milk (HM) in its different stages of maturation against two emerging flaviviruses, namely Zika virus (ZIKV) and Usutu virus (USUV) and to verify whether HM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) contribute to the milk protective effect. Colostrum, transitional and mature milk samples were collected from 39 healthy donors. The aqueous fractions were tested in vitro with specific antiviral assays and EVs and GAGs were derived and characterized. HM showed antiviral activity against ZIKV and USUV at all the stages of lactation with no significant differences in the activity of colostrum, transitional or mature milk. Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that colostrum does not inactivate viral particles, but it hampers the binding of both flaviviruses to cells. We also demonstrated that HM-EVs and HM-GAGs contribute, at least in part, to the anti-ZIKV and anti-USUV action of HM. This study discloses the intrinsic antiviral activity of HM against ZIKV and USUV and demonstrates the contribution of two bioactive components in mediating its protective effect.

Current treatment options are limited. We assessed the efficacy of a llama-derived, heavy-chain antibody fragment called anti-rotavirus protein (ARP1), in modifying the severity and duration of diarrhea in male infants with rotavirus infection.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 176 male infants (6-24 months old) with severe rotavirus-associated diarrhea at Dhaka Hospital, Bangladesh. The infants were randomly assigned to groups given oral ARP1 (15-30 mg/kg/day, n = 88) or placebo (maltodextrin, n = 88) for a maximum of 5 days. The primary outcomes were severity (stool output) and duration of diarrhea and fecal excretion of rotavirus. Secondary outcomes were intake of oral rehydration salt solution, severity of vomiting, and serum levels of rotavirus-specific IgA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn infants with only rotavirus infection, total cumulative stool output was 305.47 g/kg body weight among those given placebo (n = 63) and 237.03 g/kg body weight among those given ARP1 (n = 61) (a difference of 68.44 g/kg body weight or 22.5%; 95% confidence interval: 18.27-118.59 g/kg body weight; P =.0079).

Enhanced exposure to microbiota was achieved via low-dose dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment. Rotavirus infection and replication was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Diarrhea was scored visually.

Antibiotics reduced the diarrhea incidence and duration, indicating that the reduction in the level of rotavirus antigen was biologically significant. Despite lowered antigen level, antibiotics resulted in a more durable rotavirus mucosal/systemic humoral response.

Yes, we must understand intriguing new findings; but no, we are far from serious about widespread use of antimicrobials with routine immunizations. In this issue, Uchiyama and colleagues [1] pry open our thinking about resident microbiota and host resistance to enteric viral infections. They describe how antibiotics (ampicillin and neomycin, given for 2–8 weeks) reduce murine rotavirus infections and symptoms and enhance rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)A responses, effects that are partially mimicked in germ-free mice. Furthermore, they show that mild experimental dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis (as reflected by increased fecal lipocalin-2, perhaps reflecting “enteropathy” seen in developing areas where enteric vaccine responses are impaired) impairs late ( perhaps acquired) fecal and serum IgA responses to rotavirus infections. As heretical as the use of antibiotics to ameliorate viral infections sounds, it is not without precedent. As the authors note, Kuss et al [2] previously showed that gut bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (or Bacillus cereus, peptidoglycan, or N-acetylglucosamine [GlcNAc]-containing polysaccharides) can bind to poliovirus or reovirus to facilitate their uptake and infectivity in the intestinal tract. Kuss et al [2] used human Poliovirus receptor (PVR)-transgenic interferon alpha/beta receptor–inactivated (PVRtg-Ifnar1) poliovirus-susceptible mice and HeLa cells to show that antibiotics reduce the infectivity of poliovirus as well as that of the unrelated enteric virus, reovirus (ie, increased susceptibility to enteric (rather than parenteral or intraperitoneal) poliovirus infection without antibiotics, and increased viability of poliovirus incubated in feces of germ-free mice supplemented with bacteria (B. cereus, Escherichia coli, or Enterococcus faecalis) or microbial surface products (LPS, peptidoglycan, mucin, chitin, or GlcNAc-containing polysaccharide)). Uchiyama’s finding of unchanged + : – rotavirus strand ratios suggests that viral entry, not intracellular viral replication, is altered by antibiotic treatment. Although other explanations such as the direct antiviral activity of thiazolides, for example, nitazoxanide have recently been offered [3], might Uchiyama’s findings that antibiotics can reduce viral infectivity through alteration of the resident microbiota further explain the perplexing benefit of nitazoxanide for rotavirus infections [4, 5]? Might these intriguing new concepts of viral pathogenesis also shed light on the differential benefit of adding probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Bifidobacterium longum) to oral rehydration solutions (ORSs) for children with rotavirus compared with ORS monotherapy [6]? Similarly, how do interactions between resident flora and other select nonbacterial enteropathogens, including parasites and viruses, influence pathogenesis? Hayes et al, for example, have shown that intestinal microbes can induce the hatching of intestinal nematode eggs (Trichuris muris) in mice [7]. However, these heretical thoughts that imply antibiotics could help rotavirus diarrhea, control outbreaks, or even improve vaccine responses fly in the face of our conventional wisdom that antibiotic-mediated depletion of resident microbiota enhances susceptibility to some infections and that the overuse of antibiotics is driving increasingly worrisome drug resistance. Resident microbiota are needed for normal gut-associated lymphoid tissue development, drive T-cell and B-cell as well as dendritic cell and macrophage responses to influenza and lymhpocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus infections [8, 9] (References 11 and 12 within Uchiyama [1]), and have an obvious protective role in preventing such Received 25 February 2014; accepted 26 February 2014; electronically published 12 March 2014.

MAbs directed at VP8*, the smaller trypsin cleavage fragment of VP4, were shown to efficiently prevent binding of radiolabeled virions to MA104 cell monolayers, to an extent and at concentrations comparable to those required for neutralization of infectivity.

The structures obtained by cryo-electron microscopy of the DLP/Fab complexes and by X-ray crystallography of the VP6 trimer and the VP6/Fab-238 complex have been combined to give pseudo-atomic structures. Steric hindrance between the Fabs results in limited Fab occupancy. In particular, there are on average only three of a possible five Fabs-238 which point towards the 5-fold axis. Thus, Fabs-238 are not in a position to block the exiting mRNA, nor is there any visible conformational change in VP6 on antibody binding at a resolution of 23 A. However, the epitope of the inhibiting antibody involves two VP6 monomers, whereas, those of the non-inhibiting antibodies have an epitope on only one VP6.

Neonatal gnotobiotic pigs were orally inoculated once with virulent Wa (WaV) or three times with attenuated Wa (WaA) HRV or mock inoculated (Mock) and then were challenged with virulent Wa (WaV/PC) 28 days after the first inoculation. The ASCs from intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues of pigs from each group were quantitated by ELISPOT assay at the day of challenge, at postinoculation day 28 (WaV, WaA, and Mock) or at postchallenge day (PCD) 7 (WaV+WaV/PC, WaA+WaV/PC, and Mock+WaV/PC). In all virus-inoculated pigs, regardless of the inoculum, lymphoid tissue, or isotype, VP6 induced the highest numbers of ASCs, followed by VP4; ASCs specific for VP7, NSP3, and NSP4 were less numerous. At challenge, total HRV- and HRV protein-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG ASCs in intestinal lymphoid tissues were significantly greater in WaV- than in WaA-inoculated pigs, and WaV pigs were fully protected against diarrhea postchallenge, whereas the WaA pigs were partially protected.

Diarrhea was induced in mice by oral castor oil administration or by i.v. injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Salmonella enteritis. The antidiarrheal drug loperamide was used as control. Fecal water excretion was quantified for 2 h and paracellular permeability and electrical parameters of the colon were assessed in Ussing chambers.

Prophylactic treatment with B. subtilis CU1 or with L. plantarum CNCM I-4547 reduced LPS-induced diarrhea. The reduction of water excretion was in the same range as those induced by loperamide. In the castor oil model, this effect was only observed with B. subtilis CU1. The two probiotic treatments abolished the increase in paracellular permeability induced by LPS, but not by castor oil.

After B. subtilis CU1, colonic expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was reduced and that of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) increased. B. subtilis CU1 may increase the capacity of the colon to absorb excess of water in diarrheic conditions by acting on CFTR and NHE3 expression.

To further mechanistic studies, the PFOR operon of H. pylori was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli, and the multisubunit complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Pyruvate-dependent PFOR activity with NTZ, as measured by a decrease in absorbance at 418 nm (spectral shift from 418 to 351 nm), unlike the reduction of viologen dyes, did not result in the accumulation of products (acetyl coenzyme A and CO2) and pyruvate was not consumed in the reaction. NTZ did not displace the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) cofactor of PFOR, and the 351-nm absorbing form of NTZ was inactive. Optical scans and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses determined that the spectral shift (A418 to A351) of NTZ was due to protonation of the anion (NTZ−) of the 2-amino group of the thiazole ring which could be generated with the pure compound under acidic solutions (pKa = 6.18). We propose that NTZ− intercepts PFOR at an early step in the formation of the lactyl-TPP transition intermediate, resulting in the reversal of pyruvate binding prior to decarboxylation and in coordination with proton transfer to NTZ.

To address this question, a library of IgA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) previously developed against different proteins of rhesus rotavirus was used.

Although the potential of calcium-calmodulin inhibition has as yet not been realised, preliminary studies suggest that there are chloride channel blockers under development that will find a place in the management of secretory diarrheas. Recent work has highlighted the importance of neurohumoral mechanisms in the pathogenesis of acute diarrhea. Potentiation of the effects of endogenous enkephalin activity by enkephalinase inhibition has already produced a safe, effective anti-secretory drug, racecadotril. Speculative early work indicates that there may be a role for antagonists of 5-HT, substance P, and VIP receptors. There now seems to be a real possibility that antisecretory therapy will become more widely available in the future.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Preliminary studies suggest that there seems to be a real possibility that antisecretory therapy will become more widely available in the future."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8566,"details":{"paperId":"e6098415a79a8ec901f2d519985556216d05bbbd","externalIds":{"MAG":"2417514894","DOI":"10.1385/1-59259-854-4:011","CorpusId":"5324160","PubMed":"15375310"},"title":"Antisense inhibition: oligonucleotides, ribozymes, and siRNAs.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":867,"details":{"paperId":"47ad42f63b8a21e58482f4442bc154b64c49004c","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/978-94-007-6214-5","CorpusId":"32908113"},"title":"Antitumor Potential and other Emerging Medicinal Properties of Natural Compounds","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The current understanding of how BS-RNase exerts its cytotoxicity against malignant cells is described, which is strictly related to the RNA hydrolysis occurring in the host cytosol."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9972,"details":{"paperId":"4c474d582a31b368e1364f26fb078fc9bdf58bb1","externalIds":{"MAG":"1823271474","DOI":"10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.08.28","CorpusId":"6436380","PubMed":"23991305"},"title":"Antitumor effect of para-toluenesulfonamide against lung cancer xenograft in a mouse model.","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nConventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are relatively insensitive and unsatisfactory. Para-toluenesulfonamide (PTS), a unique antitumor drug for local intratumoral injection, shows an efficacy of severely suppressing solid tumor growth with mild side effects in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PTS on lung cancer H460 cells in vivo in nude mice and its underlying mechanisms in vitro.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA lung cancer model for in vivo experiment was established in BALB/c nude mice using H460 cells to examine the effect of local injection of PTS on tumor suppression. We also assessed the injury to the normal tissue by subcutaneous injection of PTS. In vitro, PTS was diluted into different doses for study on its antitumor mechanisms. We evaluated the necrotic effect of PTS on H460 cells by PI and Hoechst 33342 staining. Cell viability and membrane permeability were also determined by using CCK-8 and LDH assays respectively. All these tests were conducted in comparison with traditional local injection of anhydrous ethanol.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPTS was shown to significantly inhibit the growth of H460 tumor xenografts in nude mice by inducing necrosis of the tumor histologically. Its effect on tumor growth was significantly stronger than that of anhydrous ethanol. By contrast, the injured normal tissue by PTS injection was less than that by ethanol. In vitro, PTS still demonstrated excellent necrotizing effect on H460 cells when diluted to a lower concentration. Detailed analysis of PTS on H460 cells indicated that PTS had a better effect on attenuating the cell viability and increasing the cell membrane permeability than ethanol at the same level.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPTS exhibits excellent inhibition effect on the growth of lung cancer by necrotizing tumor in vivo and in vitro, reducing tumor cell viability and augmenting the membrane permeability in vitro, with only mild injury to normal tissue.

Since the introduction of rotavirus vaccines, HuNoVs have become the leading cause of diarrheal illness in children. ABSTRACT Human norovirus (HuNoV) is the leading cause of epidemic and sporadic acute gastroenteritis worldwide. HuNoV transmission occurs predominantly by direct person-to-person contact, and its health burden is associated with poor hand hygiene and a lack of effective antiseptics and disinfectants. Specific therapies and methods to prevent and control HuNoV spread previously were difficult to evaluate because of the lack of a cell culture system to propagate infectious virus. This barrier has been overcome with the successful cultivation of HuNoV in nontransformed human intestinal enteroids (HIEs). Here, we report using the HIE cultivation system to evaluate the virucidal efficacy of an olanexidine gluconate-based hand rub (OLG-HR) and 70% ethanol (EtOH70%) against HuNoVs. OLG-HR exhibited fast-acting virucidal activity against a spectrum of HuNoVs including GII.4 Sydney[P31], GII.4 Den Haag[P4], GII.4 New Orleans[P4], GII.3[P21], GII.17[P13], and GI.1[P1] strains. Exposure of HuNoV to OLG-HR for 30 to 60 s resulted in complete loss of the ability of virus to bind to the cells and reduced in vitro binding to glycans in porcine gastric mucin. By contrast, the virucidal efficiency of EtOH70% on virus infectivity was strain specific. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electron microscopy of virus-like particles (VLPs) show that OLG-HR treatment causes partial disassembly and possibly conformational changes in VP1, interfering with histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding and infectivity, whereas EtOH70% treatment causes particle disassembly and clumping of the disassembled products, leading to loss of infectivity while retaining HBGA binding. The highly effective inactivation of HuNoV infectivity by OLG-HR suggests that this compound could reduce HuNoV transmission. IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are highly contagious and cause nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis in all age groups worldwide. Since the introduction of rotavirus vaccines, HuNoVs have become the leading cause of diarrheal illness in children. These viruses are very stable in the environment and resistant to common disinfectants. This study evaluated the virucidal efficacy of a new disinfectant, olanexidine-based hand rub (OLG-HR), against HuNoV strains in an ex vivo human intestinal stem cell-derived enteroid (HIE) cultivation system. Exposure of multiple HuNoV strains to OLG-HR for 30 to 60 s resulted in complete loss of infectivity and binding to HBGAs, possibly due to partial disassembly and conformational changes in the major virus capsid (VP1). By comparison, the virucidal efficiency of EtOH70% was strain specific, leading to loss of infectivity while retaining HBGA binding. These findings show the utility of the ex vivo HIE cultivation system to test the effectiveness of disinfectants and report a highly effective product.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The virucidal efficacy of a new disinfectant, olanexidine-based hand rub (OLG-HR), against HuNoV strains in an ex vivo human intestinal stem cell-derived enteroid (HIE) cultivation system is evaluated and suggests that this compound could reduce Hu noV transmission."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7859,"details":{"paperId":"913f38f12249518390a79cadad022a2488cf8386","externalIds":{"MAG":"1963822661","DOI":"10.1159/000100808","CorpusId":"266684","PubMed":"17361093"},"title":"Antiviral Activity of Purified Human Breast Milk Mucin","abstract":"Human breast milk is known to contain numerous biologically active components which protect breast fed infants against microbes, viruses, and toxins.

As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses have the capacity to manipulate the ubiquitin (Ub) cycle to their advantage by encoding Ub-modifying proteins including deubiquitinases (DUBs). However, how cellular DUBs modulate specific viral infections, such as norovirus, is poorly understood. To examine the role of DUBs during norovirus infection, we used WP1130, a small molecule inhibitor of a subset of cellular DUBs. Replication of murine norovirus in murine macrophages and the human norovirus Norwalk virus in a replicon system were significantly inhibited by WP1130. Chemical proteomics identified the cellular DUB USP14 as a target of WP1130 in murine macrophages, and pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP14 inhibited murine norovirus infection. USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB that also binds to inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a critical mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR). WP1130 treatment of murine macrophages did not alter proteasome activity but activated the X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) through an IRE1-dependent mechanism. In addition, WP1130 treatment or induction of the UPR also reduced infection of other RNA viruses including encephalomyocarditis virus, Sindbis virus, and La Crosse virus but not vesicular stomatitis virus. Pharmacologic inhibition of the IRE1 endonuclease activity partially rescued the antiviral effect of WP1130. Taken together, our studies support a model whereby induction of the UPR through cellular DUB inhibition blocks specific viral infections, and suggest that cellular DUBs and the UPR represent novel targets for future development of broad spectrum antiviral therapies.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"These studies support a model whereby induction of the UPR through Cellular DUB inhibition blocks specific viral infections, and suggest that cellular DUBs and theUPR represent novel targets for future development of broad spectrum antiviral therapies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7393,"details":{"paperId":"4b583ea65cdd7d773d4a061084a4dd4a129b61bf","externalIds":{"MAG":"2110430527","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.75.8.3527-3536.2001","CorpusId":"24805572","PubMed":"11264342"},"title":"Antiviral Effect ofN-Butyldeoxynojirimycin against Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Correlates with Misfolding of E2 Envelope Proteins and Impairment of Their Association into E1-E2 Heterodimers","abstract":"ABSTRACT The iminosugar N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), an endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidase inhibitor, has an antiviral effect against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV).

Our results show that, while the disulfide-dependent folding of E2 glycoprotein occurs rapidly (2.5 min), the folding of E1 occurs slowly (30 min). Both BVDV envelope glycoproteins associate rapidly with calnexin and dissociate with different kinetics. The release of E1 from the interaction with calnexin coincides with the beginning of E1 and E2 association into disulfide-linked heterodimers. In the presence ofNB-DNJ, the interaction of E1 and E2 with calnexin is prevented, leading to misfolding of the envelope glycoproteins and inefficient formation of E1-E2 heterodimers.

After fractionation of the extract by a stepwise methanol gradient and evaluation of each fraction, the 80% methanol fraction displayed a pronounced inhibitory activity against the herpes viruses. The highest antiviral activity was observed when the Vero cells were treated with the extract both during and after infection by viruses. Moreover, the extract showed a prominent synergistic activity in combination with acyclovir anti-HSV therapy. Our findings revealed the potential of V. persica extract, especially its 80% methanol fraction, in inhibition of herpes simplex viral infections.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The findings revealed the potential of V. persica extract, especially its 80% methanol fraction, in inhibition of herpes simplex viral infections."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3300,"details":{"paperId":"f699a1af0de626398459be9fa54d677633588947","externalIds":{"MAG":"2087625979","DOI":"10.1016/J.VIROL.2003.12.011","CorpusId":"12940885","PubMed":"15033574"},"title":"Antiviral activity of a serine protease from the digestive juice of Bombyx mori larvae against nucleopolyhedrovirus.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that BmSP-2, an insect digestive enzyme, can be a potential antiviral factor against BmNPV at the initial site of viral infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5377,"details":{"paperId":"97cec8dfb4ca95c75ebdc277167a7349abe84ba7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2096638040","DOI":"10.1093/jac/dkt534","CorpusId":"22235226","PubMed":"24458510"},"title":"Antiviral activity of baicalin against influenza virus H1N1-pdm09 is due to modulation of NS1-mediated cellular innate immune responses.","abstract":"OBJECTIVES\nBaicalin, a flavonoid, has been shown to have antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities, although the mechanism of action has been unknown. Therefore, attempts were made to analyse the mechanism behind the antiviral effects of baicalin using an influenza A virus (IAV) model in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBaicalin's anti-influenza activity was elucidated (in vitro and in vivo) utilizing pandemic influenza strain A/H1N1/Eastern India/66/pdm09 (H1N1-pdm09). Anti-influenza activity was measured by plaque inhibition, fluorescent focus-forming units (ffu) and quantifying viral transcripts using quantitative real-time PCR following treatment with baicalin in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The role of the IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) gene in modulating host responses was measured by immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation and molecular docking.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaicalin treatment following IAV infection revealed up-regulation of interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral signalling and decreased phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) activation compared with infected, untreated controls. Baicalin exerts its antiviral effects by modulating the function of the IAV-encoded NS1 protein. NS1 has been shown to counteract cellular antiviral responses by down-regulating IFN induction and up-regulating PI3K/Akt signalling. Baicalin disrupted NS1-p85β binding. Molecular docking predicted the binding site of baicalin in the RNA binding domain (RBD) of NS1. Site-directed mutagenesis within the RBD region of NS1 and the difference in the fluorescence quenching pattern of full-length NS1 and mutant NS1 proteins in the presence of baicalin confirmed the interaction of baicalin with the NS1 RBD. Amino acid residues 39-43 of the NS1 RBD were found to be crucial for the baicalin-NS1 interaction.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOverall, this study highlights that baicalin exerts its anti-influenza virus activity by modulating viral protein NS1, resulting in up-regulation of IFN-induced antiviral signalling and a decrease in PI3K/Akt signalling in cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study highlights that baicalin exerts its anti-influenza virus activity by modulating viral protein NS1, resulting in up-regulation of IFN-induced antiviral signalling and a decrease in PI3K/Akt signalling in cells."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5811,"details":{"paperId":"17767b7f9c3d5b27343aea4ae1bfd2f3bad0345e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2148059071","DOI":"10.1099/0022-1317-79-9-2255","CorpusId":"35612051","PubMed":"9747736"},"title":"Antiviral activity of bovine collectins against rotaviruses.","abstract":"The antiviral activity against rotaviruses of three bovine collectins, conglutinin, collectin-43 (CL-43) and bovine SP-D, was examined.

The P-PMOs were designed to base pair to RNA sequences involved in different aspects of EAV amplification: genome replication, subgenomic mRNA synthesis, and translation of genome and subgenomic mRNAs. A novel recombinant EAV, expressing green fluorescent protein as part of its replicase polyproteins, was used to facilitate drug screening. A moderate reduction of EAV amplification was observed with relatively high concentrations of P-PMOs designed to anneal to the 3'-terminal regions of the viral genome or antigenome. To determine if the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs could be specifically reduced, transcription-regulating sequences essential for their production, but not for the production of genomic RNA, were targeted, but these P-PMOs were found to be ineffective at transcription interference. In contrast, all four P-PMOs designed to base pair with targets in the genomic 5' untranslated region markedly reduced virus amplification in a sequence-specific and dose-responsive manner. At concentrations in the low micromolar range, some of the P-PMOs tested completely inhibited virus amplification.

In this study, we hypothesized that during rotavirus infection, oral Arg, which stimulates p70(S6k) activation, will further stimulate intestinal protein synthesis and mucosal recovery, whereas the p70(S6k) inhibitor rapamycin (Rapa) will inhibit mucosal recovery. Newborn piglets were fed a standard milk replacer diet supplemented with Arg (0.4 g x kg(-1) x d(-1), twice daily by gavage), Rapa (2 mg x m(-2) x d(-1)), Arg + Rapa, or saline (controls). They were infected on d 6 of life with porcine rotavirus. Three days postinoculation, we measured the piglets' body weight, fecal rotavirus excretion, villus-crypt morphology, epithelial electrical resistance in Ussing chambers, and p70(S6k) activation by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We previously showed a 2-fold increase in jejunal protein synthesis during rotavirus diarrhea. In this experiment, Arg stimulated jejunal protein synthesis 1.3-fold above standard medium, and the Arg stimulation was partially inhibited by Rapa. Small bowel stimulation of p70(S6k) phosphorylation and p70(S6k) levels were inhibited >80% by Rapa. Immunohistochemistry revealed a major increase of p70(S6k) and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation in the crypt and lower villus of the infected piglets.

Several cDNA microarrays were recently proposed for Mytilus spp., but putatively identified partial transcripts have rendered the generation of robust transcriptional responses difficult in terms of pathway identification. We developed a new low density oligonucleotide microarray with 465 probes covering the same number of genes. Target genes were selected to cover most of the well-known biological processes in the stress response documented over the last decade in bivalve species at the cellular and tissue levels. Our new ‘STressREsponse Microarray’ (STREM) platform consists of eight sub-arrays with three replicates for each target in each sub-array. To assess the potential use of the new array, we tested the effect of the ubiquitous environmental pollutant benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) at 5, 50, and 100 μg/L on two target tissues, the gills and digestive gland, of Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed invivo for three days. Bioaccumulation of B[a]P was also determined demonstrating exposure in both tissues. In addition to the well-known effects of B[a]P on DNA metabolism and oxidative stress, the new array data provided clues about the implication of other biological processes, such as cytoskeleton, immune response, adhesion to substrate, and mitochondrial activities. Transcriptional data were confirmed using qRT-PCR. We further investigated cellular functions and possible alterations related to biological processes highlighted by the microarray data using oxidative stress biomarkers (Lipofuscin content) and the assessment of genotoxicity. DNA damage, as measured by the alkaline comet assay, increased as a function of dose.DNA adducts measurements using 32P-postlabeling method also showed the presence of bulky DNA adducts (i.e. dG-N2-BPDE).

Reasons for this disparity are not fully understood. We assessed the role of maternal factors including breast milk RV-specific IgA, transplacentally acquired infant serum RV-specific IgG and maternal HIV status in seroconversion among Zambian infants routinely immunized with Rotarix™ (RV1). Methods 420 mother-child pairs were recruited at infant age 6–12 weeks in Lusaka. Clinical information and samples were collected at baseline and at one month following the second dose of RV1. Determination of breast milk RV-specific IgA and serum RV-specific IgA and IgG was done using standardized ELISA. Seroconversion was defined as a ≥ 4 fold rise in serum IgA titre from baseline to one-month post RV1 dose 2, while seropositivity of IgA was defined as serum titre ≥ 40 and antibody variables were modelled on log-base 2. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of the odds of seroconversion. Results Baseline infant seropositivity was 25.5% (91/357). The seroconversion frequency was 60.2% (130/216). Infants who were IgA seropositive at baseline were less likely to seroconvert compared to their seronegative counterparts (P = 0.04). There was no evidence of an association between maternal HIV status and seroconversion (P = 0.25). Higher titres of breast milk rotavirus-specific IgA were associated with a lower frequency of seroconverson (Nonparametric test for trend Z = -2.84; P<0.01): a two-fold increase in breast milk RV-specific IgA titres was associated with a 22% lower odds of seroconversion (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.68–0.94; P = 0.01). There was seasonal variation in baseline breast milk rotavirus-specific IgA titres, with significantly higher GMTs during the cold dry months (P = 0.01). Conclusion Low immunogenicity of RV1 vaccine could be explained in part by exposure to high antibody titres in breast milk and early exposure to wild-type rotavirus infections.

Grp78 (also known as BiP) is a target of autoaggressive B and T cell responses in our murine model of anti‐Ro (SS‐A) autoimmunity and also in rheumatoid arthritis. In this report we demonstrate reciprocal intermolecular spreading occurs between Ro52 and Grp78 in immunized mice, reflecting physiological association of these molecules in vivo. Moreover, we provide direct biochemical evidence that Grp78 associates with the clinically relevant autoantigen, Ro52 (SS‐A). Due to the discrete compartmentalization of Ro52 (nucleocytoplasmic) and Grp78 (endoplasmic reticulum; ER) we propose that association of these molecules occurs either in apoptotic cells, where they have been demonstrated indirectly to co‐localize in discrete apoptotic bodies, or in B cells themselves where both Ro52 and Grp78 are known to bind to immunoglobulin heavy chains. Tagging of molecules by association with Grp78 may facilitate receptor mediated phagocytotsis of the complex; we show evidence that exogenous Grp78 can associate with cell surface receptors on a subpopulation of murine splenocytes. Given the likelihood that Grp78 will associate with viral glycoproteins in the ER it is possible that it may become a bystander target of the spreading antiviral immune response.

However, there is limited evidence on the role of individual HMOs in the risk of otitis media (OM), as well as lower and upper respiratory tract infections (LRTI and URTI, respectively) in children up to 2 years. Objective: To investigate whether individual HMO concentrations measured at 6 weeks of lactation were associated with risk of OM, LRTI or URTI up to 2 years in breastfed infants. Associations with OM, LRTI and URTI were determined for the most prominent human milk oligosaccharides including 13 neutral, partly isomeric structures (trioses up to hexaoses), two acidic trioses, and lactose. Design: HMO measurements and physician reported data on infections were available from human milk samples collected at 6 weeks postpartum (n = 667). Associations of HMOs with infections were assessed in crude and adjusted models using modified Poisson regression. Results: Absolute concentrations (median [min, max], in g/L) of 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL) tended (p = 0.04) to be lower, while lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) was higher in the milk for infants with OM in the 1st year of life (p = 0.0046). In the milk of secretor mothers, LNT was significantly higher in the milk for infants with OM (RR [95% CI]: 0.98 [0.15, 2.60]) compared to infants without OM (RR [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.14, 2.90]) at 1 year (p = 0.0019).

They were inserted either at the 5' end or immediately after the capsid protein coding region, at the junction between precursors P1 and P2. A protease cleavage site for 3C protease was introduced 3' to the foreign sequences to enable proteolytic processing of the antigen from the poliovirus polyprotein. Infectious viruses were generated from several of the DNA constructs, and the presence of the foreign gene sequences was confirmed by reverse transcription of the viral RNA and PCR amplification. Viruses with inserts of about 300 bases maintained the foreign sequences during passage in Vero cells.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the NSP4 protein gene revealed only one base pair change between the virulent (unpassaged) and attenuated 89-12 viruses, which resulted from a substitution of alanine for threonine at amino acid 45 of the encoded NSP4 protein. Because both threonine and alanine have been found at position 45 of NSP4 in symptomatic and asymptomatic human rotaviruses, neither amino acid in this position could be established as a marker of virulence.

In this study, the target gene, alanine racemase (alr), in the genome of Lactobacillus casei strain W56 (L. casei W56) was knocked out to construct an auxotrophic L. casei strain (L. casei Δalr W56) using the CRISPR-Cas9D10A gene editing system.

Mice orally immunized with pPG-alr-VP4/Δalr W56 exhibited high levels of serum IgG and mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), which exhibited neutralizing effects against PoRV. Cytokines levels in serum detected using ELISA, indicated that the recombinant strain induced an immune response dominated by Th2 cells.

As proof of concept and to illustrate the practical use, we have applied the framework to assess benefits and risks of off‐label use of ondansetron for gastroenteritis‐induced nausea and vomiting. The framework could also guide decisions on off‐label use in other special populations (e.g., pregnant women, elderly, obese, or critically ill patients) where off‐label drug use is frequent, thereby contributing to effective and safe pharmacotherapy.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A tutorial of the BRAvO decision framework: Benefit and Risk Assessment for Off-label use offers a structured assessment of benefits and risks of off-label drug use, including a clinical pharmacological based approach to age-appropriate dose selection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":402,"details":{"paperId":"ae39538a30d55f1c08801cf4fe7876ff650ccfcc","externalIds":{"MAG":"2997811773","DOI":"10.1002/pep2.24145","CorpusId":"214419746","PubMed":"33575525"},"title":"Bent into shape: Folded peptides to mimic protein structure and modulate protein function","abstract":"Protein secondary and tertiary structure mimics have served as model systems to probe biophysical parameters that guide protein folding and as attractive reagents to modulate protein interactions.

Methods A bibliometric study on four databases (1984-2016) – Medline, Scopus, LILACS, and SciELO – characterizing the global scientific production of nitazoxanide. We determined the quantity, quality (number of citations), and types of studies developed by each country, characterizing them by years, international cooperation, development, place of publication, authors (with its H-index), and groups with higher impact. Results There were 512 articles in Medline – the higher scientific production is from the USA (19.71%), Switzerland (7.51%), and Mexico (7.27%). There were 1,440 articles in Scopus – from the USA (8.98%), Mexico (2.13%), and India (1.65%). There were 405 articles in LILACS – from Mexico (4.69%), the USA (4.2%), and Peru (2.47%). There were 47 articles in SciELO – from Brazil (34.04%), Venezuela (21.28%), and Colombia (14.89%). The H-index of nitazoxanide is 75 – the USA (26), Egypt (12), and Canada (10) were the countries contributing more with that. Conclusions Nitazoxanide research has been highly important. Nevertheless, it is relatively limited when compared with other drugs. Its research has been led by the USA, as revealed in this bibliometric assessment. Although some developing countries, where it is used especially for protozoa and helminths, probably have its influence, and this explains the fact that Mexico and India, among others, are the top countries in the scientific production of this anti-infective agent. This bibliometric study evidenced a relatively low number of publications, however, it has been increased in recent years.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Nitazoxanide research has been highly important, Nevertheless, it is relatively limited when compared with other drugs, as revealed in this bibliometric assessment."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1466,"details":{"paperId":"2018d2d88f98ef582fbbee0c1b84d4140e4e9bdd","externalIds":{"MAG":"2605923174","PubMedCentral":"5801392","DOI":"10.1007/s12602-017-9277-7","CorpusId":"46773633","PubMed":"28432676"},"title":"Bifidobacterium adolescentis (DSM 20083) and Lactobacillus casei (Lafti L26-DSL): Probiotics Able to Block the In Vitro Adherence of Rotavirus in MA104 Cells","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that the antiviral effect may be occurring directly with the viral particle instead of making a blocking effect of the cellular receptors that are needed for the viral entrance."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3287,"details":{"paperId":"674e2d55f88e22b68bb5e3306e7637df72284279","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.109097","CorpusId":"233482161","PubMed":"33933854"},"title":"Bile acids LCA and CDCA inhibited porcine deltacoronavirus replication in vitro\n","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results may open new avenues for the development of antiviral drugs to treat PDCoV infection in pigs through a GPCR-IFN-λ3-ISG15 signaling axis in IPEC-J2 cells."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8447,"details":{"paperId":"ece15b9cc9ec764154498e76d0e6ff06574afd56","externalIds":{"MAG":"2806234556","PubMedCentral":"6118352","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0198983","CorpusId":"52140088","PubMed":"30169511"},"title":"Bile acids target proteolipid nano-assemblies of EGFR and phosphatidic acid in the plasma membrane for stimulation of MAPK signaling","abstract":"Bile acids are critical biological detergents in the gastrointestinal tract and also act as messengers to regulate a multitude of intracellular signaling events, including mitogenic signaling, lipid metabolism and endo/exocytosis. In particular, bile acids stimulate many receptors and ion channels on the cell surface, the mechanisms of which are still poorly understood. Membrane-associating proteins depend on the local spatial distribution of lipids in the plasma membrane (PM) for their function. Here, we report that the highly amphipathic secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), a major constituent in the human bile, at doses <1μM enhances the nanoclustering of phosphatidic acid (PA) but disrupts the local segregation of phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the basolateral PM of the human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. PA has been shown to be a key structural component of the signaling nano-domains of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the cell surface. We show that DCA promotes the co-localization between PA and EGFR, the PA-driven EGFR dimerization/oligomerization and EGFR signaling. Depletion of PA abolishes the stimulatory effects of DCA on the EGFR oligomerization and signaling. This effect occurs in the cultured Caco-2 cells and the ex vivo human intestinal enteroids. We propose a novel mechanism, where the amphiphilic DCA monomers alter the nano-assemblies of anionic phospholipids and in turn change the dynamic structural integrity of the lipid-driven oligomerization of cell surface receptors and their signal transduction.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is reported that the highly amphipathic secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) at doses <1μM enhances the nanoclustering of phosphatidic acid (PA) but disrupts the local segregation of phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the basolateral PM of the human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4539,"details":{"paperId":"2bb4eccd129aa83c03f7acbb7e622b063ac5d229","externalIds":{"MAG":"1988223055","DOI":"10.1042/BJ20050898","CorpusId":"20396540","PubMed":"16266293"},"title":"Bile-salt-stimulated lipase and mucins from milk of 'secretor' mothers inhibit the binding of Norwalk virus capsids to their carbohydrate ligands.","abstract":"Breast-feeding-associated protection against calicivirus diarrhoea is associated with the presence of high levels of 2-linked oligosaccharides in mother's milk, and human calicivirus strains including the NV (Norwalk virus) use gut 2-linked fucosylated glycans as receptors, suggesting the presence of decoy receptors in milk.

By taking advantage of such interactions of the norovirus shell (S) domain that naturally builds the interior shells of norovirus capsids, we have developed a technology to produce 60-valent, icosahedral S60 nanoparticles through the E. coli system. This has been achieved by several modifications to the S domain, including an R69A mutation to destruct an exposed proteinase cleavage site and triple cysteine mutations (V57C/Q58C/S136C) to establish inter-S domain disulfide bonds for enhanced inter-S domain interactions. The polyvalent S60 nanoparticle with 60 exposed S domain C-termini offers an ideal platform for antigen presentation, leading to enhanced immunogenicity to the surface-displayed antigens for vaccine development. This was proven by constructing a chimeric S60 nanoparticle displaying 60 rotavirus (RV) VP8* proteins, the major RV-neutralizing antigen. These S60-VP8* particles are easily produced and elicited high IgG response in mice toward the displayed VP8* antigens. The mouse antisera after immunization with the S60-VP8* particles exhibited high blockades against RV VP8* binding to its glycan ligands and high neutralizing activities against RV infection in culture cells. The three-dimensional structures of the S60 and S60-VP8* particles were studied. Furthermore, the S60 nanoparticle can display other antigens, supporting the notion that the S60 nanoparticle is a multifunctional vaccine platform.

Glycomimetic compounds, which mimic the structure and function of native glycans, have been successful in producing molecules with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) features. Several strategies have been developed for glycomimetic design such as ligand pre-organization or reducing polar surface area. A related approach to developing glycomimetics relies on the bioisosteric replacement of carbohydrate functional groups. These changes can offer improvements to both binding affinity (e.g., reduced desolvation costs, enhanced metal chelation) and pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., improved oral bioavailability).

The atomic co-ordinates of an Fab were fitted to the cryo-electron microscope density map to produce a binding model. The VLP has a T = 3 icosahedral lattice consisting of a hollow spherical shell with 90 protruding arches. Each dimeric arch presents two mAb binding sites; however, steric hindrance between the variable domains of the Fabs prevents the occupation of both sites simultaneously. Thus the maximum mAb occupation is 50%. Once a mAb is bound to one site it may bind to either of two neighbouring sites related by a local 3-fold axis. The mAbs are bound bivalently on epitopes not related by a 2-fold symmetry axis.

Siglec-2 (CD22), as a consequence of its pivotal role in B cell activation, has become an attractive target for therapies of autoimmune diseases and B cell-derived nonHodgkin s lymphoma (NHL). NHL is among the ten most common cancers with over 20000 deaths in 2010 for the US alone. Siglec-2 binds with high preference to a(2,6)-linked sialic acids (Sia), such as Neu5Aca(2,6)lactosamine (Scheme 1). Neu5Aca2Me (1) interacts with Siglec-2 mainly through 1) the negative charge on its carboxylate group, 2) the C-5 N-acetamido substituent, and 3) the glycerol side chain. Furthermore, replacement of the C-9 hydroxy group by an amino group did not interfere with binding to Siglecs. Crystallographic studies on Siglec-1 (sialoadhesin, Sn) demonstrated that acylation of this amino group enhances the overall affinity of the ligand for Siglecs by two to three orders of magnitude. The first breakthrough in the development of potent Siglec-2 inhibitors was the design of 9biphenylcarboxamido Neu5Aca2Me (9-BPC-Neu5Aca2Me, 2) which has a more than two orders of magnitude higher affinity to Siglec-2 than 1, and 2 has demonstrated potential to modulate signal transduction in B cells. Furthermore, based on 2, compounds were developed, which kill B cell lymphoma cells. Structural studies and modifications of the C-5 N-acyl substituent and the C-2 aglycon moiety of Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) have led to further improvement in affinity. Herein we report, for the first time the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a novel class of disubstituted Neu5Ac derivatives that is modified at the C-4 and C-9 positions of 1. Our structure-based design approach resulted in a promising novel lead compound 9-biphenylcarboxamido-4-m-nitrophenylcarboxamido-4,9-dideoxy Neu5Aca2Me (9-BPC-4mNPC-Neu5Aca2Me, 6b) that has sub-micromolar affinity for Siglec-2 and may provide a pathway for immunoglycotherapy strategies. An evaluation of our homology model (see Supporting Information) for Siglec-2 and other Siglecs led us to hypothesize that substituents at C-4 may provide additional interactions.

Immunization of mouse strains lacking one or more lymphocyte populations revealed that protection was dependent on αβ T cells but mice lacking γδ T cells and B cells remained fully protected. Furthermore, depletion of CD8 T cells in immunized B-cell-deficient mice before challenge resulted in no loss of protection, while depletion of CD4 T cells caused complete loss of protection. Therefore, αβ CD4 T cells appeared to be the only lymphocytes required for protection. As confirmation, purified splenic T cells from immunized mice were intraperitoneally injected into Rag-2 mice chronically infected with EDIM.

Importantly, transmission of these viruses, and specifically late steps of budding, critically depend upon host cell machinery. Consequently, strategies which target these mechanisms represent potential targets for broad spectrum host oriented therapeutics. An important cellular signal implicated previously in EBOV budding is calcium. Indeed, host cell calcium signals are increasingly being recognized to play a role in steps of entry, replication, and transmission for a range of viruses, but if and how filoviruses and arenaviruses mobilize calcium and the precise stage of virus transmission regulated by calcium have not been defined. Here we demonstrate that expression of matrix proteins from both filoviruses and arenaviruses triggers an increase in host cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration by a mechanism that requires host Orai1 channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Orai1 regulates both VLP and infectious filovirus and arenavirus production and spread. Notably, suppression of the protein that triggers Orai activation (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1, STIM1) and genetic inactivation or pharmacological blockade of Orai1 channels inhibits VLP and infectious virus egress.

The greatest effect was seen with the formulation DC-Chol/DOPE, which gave a 20-fold increase in initial transduction rate. This allowed an efficiency of transduction after brief exposure of target cells to virus plus liposome that could be achieved only after extensive exposure to virus alone. Enhancement with DC-Chol/DOPE was optimal when stable virion-liposome complexes were preformed. The transduction rate for complexed virus, as for virus used alone or with the polycation Polybrene, showed first-order dependence on virus concentration. Cationic liposomes, but not Polybrene, were able to mediate envelope-independent transduction, but optimal efficiency required envelope-receptor interaction. When virus complexed with DC-Chol/DOPE was used to transduce human mesothelioma xenografts, transduction was enhanced four- to fivefold compared to that for virus alone.

Current vaccination approaches against this emerging coronavirus are only partially effective, though natural infection protects pigs against reinfection and provides lactogenic immunity to suckling piglets. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein, responsible for receptor binding and cell entry, is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. However, knowledge of antibody epitopes, their nature and location in the spike structure, and the mechanisms by which the antibodies interfere with infection is scarce. Here we describe the generation and characterization of 10 neutralizing and nonneutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against the S1 receptor binding subunit of the S protein. By expression of different S1 protein fragments, six antibody epitope classes distributed over the five structural domains of the S1 subunit were identified. Characterization of antibodies for cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization revealed antigenic differences among PEDV strains. The epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies segregated into two epitope classes and mapped within the N-terminal sialic acid binding domain and in the more C-terminal receptor binding domain. Antibody neutralization escape mutants displayed single amino acid substitutions that impaired antibody binding and neutralization and defined the locations of the epitopes. Our observations picture the antibody epitope landscape of the PEDV S1 subunit and reveal that its cell attachment domains are key targets of neutralizing antibodies. IMPORTANCE Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an emerging porcine coronavirus, causes an economically important enteric disease in pigs. Effective PEDV vaccines for disease control are currently lacking. The spike (S) glycoprotein on the virion surface is the key player in virus cell entry and, therefore, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the antigenic landscape of the PEDV spike protein, we developed monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein's S1 receptor binding region and characterized their epitopes, neutralizing activity, and cross-reactivity toward multiple PEDV strains. Epitopes of antibodies segregated into six epitope classes dispersed over the multidomain S1 structure. Monoclonal antibodies revealed antigenic variability in B-cell epitopes between PEDV strains. The epitopes of neutralizing antibodies mapped to two distinct domains in S1 that are involved in binding to carbohydrate and proteinaceous cell surface molecules, respectively, indicating the importance of these cell attachment sites on the PEDV spike protein in eliciting a protective humoral immune response.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"To understand the antigenic landscape of the PEDV spike protein, monoclonal antibodies were developed against the spike protein's S1 receptor binding region and their epitopes, neutralizing activity, and cross-reactivity toward multiple P EDV strains were characterized."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":382,"details":{"paperId":"9345b6ef5509dd33f6e987bf82df97654841594c","externalIds":{"MAG":"2134906786","DOI":"10.1002/JPS.20676","CorpusId":"954577","PubMed":"16850395"},"title":"Cell adhesion molecules for targeted drug delivery.","abstract":"Rapid advancement of the understanding of the structure and function of cell adhesion molecules (i.e., integrins, cadherins) has impacted the design and development of drugs (i.e., peptide, proteins) with the potential to treat cancer and heart and autoimmune diseases.

More than 25 years later, 65 million people have been infected with HIV-1; nearly half of these people have died of AIDS, and despite many scientific advances we are still without an efficacious vaccine (Merson, 2006). The majority of HIV-1 infections and deaths have occurred in developing countries, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for over 38 million HIV-1 infections alone. Sadly, the number of new infections currently exceeds our ability to treat everyone infected with the virus, and in the hardest-hit countries the social and economic backlash has been profound. After HIV-1 was isolated, a blood test to screen patients and the blood supply quickly followed, as did research on its structure and pathogenesis. Many assumed that a vaccine would be available in a few years, and excitement increased further with the licensing of the first effective drug against HIV-1, zidovudine (AZT) (Fischl et al., 1987). However, researchers soon discovered that the virus was highly resilient, and HIV-1 quickly developed resistance to AZT (Poli et al., 1989, Richman et al., 1994). Over the next few years, a number of new antiretroviral drugs were developed that attacked the virus in different ways, and it was at this time that a new approach to therapy ensued. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combined three or more different drugs to reduce HIV-1 replication, and significantly improved the prognosis of HIV-1-infected individuals (Richman et al., 2009). However, HAART was not a cure, and many patients were resistant to at least one of the antiretroviral drugs. In addition, the drugs were highly toxic, making adherence to treatment difficult. During this time, the vaccine field was also hard at work, trying to develop a safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine. Most initial vaccine approaches focused on the HIV-1 envelope protein (gp120), and aimed to induce an antibody response to gp120. AIDSVAX was the first vaccine candidate of this type, and was developed by a U.S. pharmaceutical company called VaxGen (Flynn et al., 2005, Pitisuttithum et al., 2006).

Although such vectors are usually “gutted” and are replication defective, they are subjected to clearance by the host cells by immune recognition and destruction. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a naturally evolved cyto-protective signaling pathway which is triggered due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in its lumen. The UPR signaling consists of three signaling pathways, namely PKR-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring protein-1. Once activated, UPR triggers the production of ER molecular chaperones and stress response proteins to help reduce the protein load within the ER. This occurs by degradation of the misfolded proteins and ensues in the arrest of protein translation machinery. If the burden of protein load in ER is beyond its processing capacity, UPR can activate pro-apoptotic pathways or autophagy leading to cell death. Viruses are naturally evolved in hijacking the host cellular translation machinery to generate a large amount of proteins. This phenomenon disrupts ER homeostasis and leads to ER stress. Alternatively, in the case of gutted vectors used in gene therapy, the excess load of recombinant vectors administered and encountered by the cell can trigger UPR. Thus, in the context of gene therapy, UPR becomes a major roadblock that can potentially trigger inflammatory responses against the vectors and reduce the efficiency of gene transfer.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In the context of gene therapy, UPR becomes a major roadblock that can potentially trigger inflammatory responses against the vectors and reduce the efficiency of gene transfer."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5563,"details":{"paperId":"a4c6918d8178e6f6a6f409cddd72c7c717158543","externalIds":{"MAG":"2314126070","DOI":"10.1097/00042560-199908150-00003","CorpusId":"27294958","PubMed":"10458617"},"title":"Cerebrospinal fluid HIV RNA and drug levels with combination ritonavir and saquinavir.","abstract":"UNLABELLED\nCombination antiretroviral therapy with ritonavir and saquinavir has established potent and durable activity on plasma viremia.

The impact of the RV vaccine on the total incidence of intussusception (attributable risk of Rotashield vaccine) has not yet been thoroughly evaluated but could be very small (Nakagomi, 2000). Nonetheless, given the reported strength of the temporal association, it seems unlikely that this vaccine will ever be reconsidered for widespread use in the United States. Hence, the need for a new vaccine or vaccines is great. Since the Rotashield vaccine also had minor side effects (low-grade fever in children, primarily after the first dose) (Vesikari et al., 1999) and induced incomplete protection (Bresee et al., 1999; Conner et al., 996), the obstacles to the development of an ideal RV accine are not trivial (Table 1). In this brief review, we ill address selected immunological problems associted with the development of a successful RV vaccine. Studies in naturally infected children and in animals ave shown that intestinal antibodies are pivotal in proection from RV reinfection (Conner et al., 1996; Coulson t al., 1992; Feng et al., 1994; Franco and Greenberg, 999; Matson et al., 1993). As opposed to systemic memry antibody responses, antiviral intestinal IgA reponses in people are generally of short duration (Coulon et al., 1992; Murphy, 1999) and this is one of the likely explanations for the high rate of reinfection and disease in young children and some adults (Conner et al., 1996; elazques et al., 1996).

CD4+ T cells are essential for maximal development of RV-specific intestinal immunoglobulin A. In this study, we took advantage of the cytokine flow cytometry technique to obtain a detailed map of H-2b- and H-2d-restricted CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes from the RV proteins VP6 and VP7. Three new CD8+ T-cell epitopes (H-2d and H-2b restricted) and one new CD4+ T-cell epitope (H-2d and H-2b restricted) were identified. Using these newly identified targets, we characterized the development and specificity of cellular immune responses in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice during acute infection of infants and adults. We found that both the CD4+ and CD8+ responses peaked on days 5 to 7 after infection and then declined rapidly. Interestingly, both the response kinetics and tissue distributions were different when epitopes on VP6 and VP7 were compared. VP6 elicited a response which predominated in the intestine, while the response to VP7 was more systemic.

By immunizing mice with K562 cells, we have isolated four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), K5.M1, K5.M2, K5.M3, and K5.M4, that inhibit HTLV-induced syncytium formation between infected MT2 cells and susceptible K562/VCAM1 cells. These MAbs recognize distinct proteins on the surface of cells as determined by cell phenotyping, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis. Since three of the proteins recognized by the MAbs appear to be GPI linked, we isolated lipid rafts and determined by immunoblot analysis that all four MAbs recognize proteins that sort entirely or in large part to lipid rafts. Dispersion of lipid rafts on the cells by cholesterol depletion with β-cyclodextrin resulted in inhibition of syncytium formation, and this effect was not seen when the β-cyclodextrin was preloaded with cholesterol before treating the cells.

Variants that can efficiently infect neuraminidase-treated cells have been isolated, indicating that attachment to sialic acid is not an essential step for animal rotaviruses to infect cells. To identify and characterize the neuraminidase-resistant receptor for rotaviruses, we have isolated a hybridoma that secrets a monoclonal antibody (MAb) (2D9) that specifically blocks the infectivity of wild-type (wt) RRV and of its sialic acid-independent variant nar3, in untreated as well as in neuraminidase-treated cells. The infectivity of a human rotavirus was also inhibited, although to a lesser extent. MAb 2D9 blocks the binding of the variant to MA104 cells, while not affecting the binding of wt RRV; in addition, this MAb blocked the attachment of a recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-VP5 fusion protein, but did not affect the binding of GST-VP8. Altogether these results suggest that MAb 2D9 is directed to the neuraminidase-resistant receptor.

In recent years, a few endogenous small molecules from host, such as estradiol and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived lipid mediator protection D1 (PD1), were demonstrated to be capable of inhibiting IAV infection. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), one of the main primary bile acids, is synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and classically functions in emulsification and absorption of dietary fats. Clinically, CDCA has been used in the treatment of patients with cholesterol gallstones for more than five decades. In this study, we showed that CDCA attenuated the replication of three subtypes of influenza A virus, including a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, in A549 and MDCK cell cultures with IC50 ranging from 5.5 to 11.5 μM. Mechanistically, CDCA effectively restrained the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes.

Until recently, no effective therapy is available to specifically inactivate the rotavirion particles within the gut. Passive immunotherapy by oral administration of chicken egg yolk antibody (IgY) has emerged of late as a fresh alternative strategy to control infectious diseases of the alimentary tract and has been applied in the treatment of diarrhea due to rotavirus infection. The purpose of this concise review is to evaluate evidence on the properties and performance of anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin Y (IgY) for prevention and treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in human and animal neonates. A survey of relevant anti-rotavirus IgY basic studies and clinical trials among neonatal animals (since 1994-2015) and humans (since 1982-2015) have been reviewed and briefly summarized. Our analysis of a number of rotavirus investigations involving animal and human clinical trials revealed that anti-rotavirus IgY significantly reduced the severity of clinical manifestation of diarrhea among IgY-treated subjects relative to a corresponding control or placebo group. The accumulated information as a whole depicts oral IgY to be a safe and efficacious option for treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in neonates.

Recently, laying chickens have attracted considerable attention as an alternative source of antibodies for the prevention and treatment of infectious GI diseases. After immunization, the specific antibodies (called IgY) are transported to the egg yolk, from which the IgY then can be separated without sacrificing chickens. A chicken usually lays about 280 eggs in a year, and egg yolk contains 100-150 mg of IgY per yolk, suggesting that more than 40 g of IgY per year can be obtained from each chicken through eggs. IgY is also an alternative to antibiotics for treatment of enteric antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Oral administration of IgY has proved successful for treatment of a variety of GI infections, such as bovine and human rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, Yersinia ruckeri, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Edwardsiella tarda, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas. The IgY technology offers great future opportunities for designing prophylactic strategies against infectious GI diseases in humans and animals.

The chloride secretion largely depends on non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) enterotoxic activity in human enterocytes through mechanisms that have not been defined. Redox imbalance is a common event in cells infected by viruses, but the role of oxidative stress in RV infection is unknown. RV SA11 induced chloride secretion in association with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Caco-2 cells. The ratio between reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione was decreased by RV. The same effects were observed when purified NSP4 was added to Caco-2 cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, strongly inhibited the increase in ROS and GSH imbalance. These results suggest a link between oxidative stress and RV-induced diarrhea. Because Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) has been effectively used to treat RV diarrhea, we tested its effects on RV-infected cells. Sb supernatant prevented RV-induced oxidative stress and strongly inhibited chloride secretion in Caco-2 cells. These results were confirmed in an organ culture model using human intestinal biopsies, demonstrating that chloride secretion induced by RV-NSP4 is oxidative stress-dependent and is inhibited by Sb, which produces soluble metabolites that prevent oxidative stress.

The rotaviral enterotoxin, NSP4, has been proposed to stimulate calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCC) on the apical plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. We previously identified red wine and small molecule CaCC inhibitors. Objective To investigate the efficacy of a red wine extract and a synthetic small molecule, CaCCinh-A01, in inhibiting intestinal CaCCs and rotaviral diarrhoea. Design Inhibition of CaCC-dependent current was measured in T84 cells and mouse ileum. The effectiveness of an orally administered wine extract and CaCCinh-A01 in inhibiting diarrhoea in vivo was determined in a neonatal mouse model of rotaviral infection. Results Screening of ∼150 red wines revealed a Cabernet Sauvignon that inhibited CaCC current in T84 cells with IC50 at a ∼1:200 dilution, and higher concentrations producing 100% inhibition. A >1 kdalton wine extract prepared by dialysis, which retained full inhibition activity, blocked CaCC current in T84 cells and mouse intestine. In rotavirus-inoculated mice, oral administration of the wine extract prevented diarrhoea by inhibition of intestinal fluid secretion without affecting rotaviral infection. The wine extract did not inhibit the cystic fibrosis chloride channel (CFTR) in cell cultures, nor did it prevent watery stools in neonatal mice administered cholera toxin, which activates CFTR-dependent fluid secretion.

Lipid rafts, cholesterol-enriched lipid-ordered membrane domains, are platforms for a variety of cellular functions. In this study, we found that disruption of lipid raft formation by cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or cholesterol chelation with filipin III reduces JEV and DEN-2 infection, mainly at the intracellular replication steps and, to a lesser extent, at viral entry. Using a membrane flotation assay, we found that several flaviviral nonstructural proteins are associated with detergent-resistant membrane structures, indicating that the replication complex of JEV and DEN-2 localizes to the membranes that possess the lipid raft property. Interestingly, we also found that addition of cholesterol readily blocks flaviviral infection, a result that contrasts with previous reports of other viruses, such as Sindbis virus, whose infectivity is enhanced by cholesterol. Cholesterol mainly affected the early step of the flavivirus life cycle, because the presence of cholesterol during viral adsorption greatly blocked JEV and DEN-2 infectivity. Flavirial entry, probably at fusion and RNA uncoating steps, was hindered by cholesterol. Our results thus suggest a stringent requirement for membrane components, especially with respect to the amount of cholesterol, in various steps of the flavivirus life cycle.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that disruption of lipid raft formation by cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or cholesterol chelation with filipin III reduces JEV and DEN-2 infection, mainly at the intracellular replication steps and, to a lesser extent, at viral entry."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3499,"details":{"paperId":"985749c78d2a01acb450f128da560137d686de1e","externalIds":{"MAG":"1989579222","DOI":"10.1016/j.virusres.2010.06.008","CorpusId":"29761017","PubMed":"20600396"},"title":"Cholesterol depletion affects infectivity and stability of pseudorabies virus.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that reducing cholesterol levels reduced both the infectivity of newly produced infectious virus and their stability, as assessed by determining virus titers immediately after treatment or upon storage of the virus at room temperature or frozen."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9111,"details":{"paperId":"b4ffab54dcabf4c06bf785fe812548eb15ec53aa","externalIds":{"MAG":"3137716030","DOI":"10.31989/FFHD.V11I3.780","CorpusId":"233629614"},"title":"Cholesterol in virus entry into host cell: diet, phytosterols and statins","abstract":"Cholesterol has been reported in a number of studies to play an essential role in the effectiveness of viral infection in mammal cells.

Even though some vaccines are currently available, their efficacy is lower in the developing world, as compared to developed countries. Therefore, alternative or complementary treatment options are needed in the developing countries where the disease burden is the largest. The effect of Lactobacillus in promoting health and its use as a vehicle for delivery of protein and antibody fragments was previously shown. In this study, we have developed co-expression vectors enabling Lactobacillus paracasei BL23 to produce two VHH fragments against rotavirus (referred to as anti-rotavirus proteins 1 and 3, ARP1 and ARP3) as secreted and/or surface displayed products. ARP1 and ARP3 fragments were successfully co-expressed as shown by Western blot and flow cytometry. In addition, engineered Lactobacillus produced VHH antibody fragments were shown to bind to a broad range of rotavirus serotypes (including the human rotavirus strains 69M, Va70, F45, DS1, Wa and ST3 and simian rotavirus strains including RRV and SA11), by flow cytometry and ELISA. Hereby, we have demonstrated for the first time that when RRV was captured by one VHH displayed on the surface of co-expressor Lactobacillus, targeting other epitope was possible with another VHH secreted from the same bacterium. Therefore, Lactobacillus producing two VHH antibody fragments may potentially serve as treatment against rotavirus with a reduced risk of development of escape mutants.

Stable transfectants of baby hamster kidney (BHK) epithelial cells expressing either one or both of the chimeric envelope glycoproteins of HCV on the cell surface were generated.

Further studies suggested that that the E1-G/E2-G or E2-G pseudotype was more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of heparin than the E1-G pseudotype. Treatment of the E1-G/E2-G pseudotype with a negatively charged sulfated sialyl lipid (NMSO3) displayed a ∼4-fold-higher sensitivity to neutralization than pseudotypes with either of the two individual glycoproteins.

Here, we find that the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-associated commensal bacteria, Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB), promotes early protection against the bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, independently of CD4+ T cells. Global analyses demonstrated that SFB induced histone modifications in IECs at sites enriched for the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) motif. Interestingly, SFB-colonized mice exhibited greater expression of RAR targets during infection relative to germ-free mice, suggesting SFB may enhance defense through retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Consistent with this, supplementing germ-free mice with RA decreased pathogen levels. Further, mice with impaired RA-responsiveness in IECs displayed increased susceptibility to C. rodentium infection. RA was elevated in the intestine of mice colonized with SFB, indicating that the presence of commensal bacteria can modulate intestinal RA levels. However, this regulation by SFB was not dependent on mammalian RA production. Sequence analyses suggested that RA-generating enzymes are expressed by a subset of commensal bacteria. Remarkably, RA was produced by intestinal bacteria including SFB, and inhibiting RA signaling blocked SFB-induced protection against C. rodentium infection.

To understand how the conformation of the capsid affects the efficiency of transcriptional events in the viral core, we carried out a series of comparative structural and biochemical studies to characterize four different structural forms of the virus exhibiting differing transcriptional behavior. Two of these were virus-antibody complexes having contrasting transcriptional capabilities, and two were variant structural forms of the virus that exist during the life cycle and also exhibit contrasting transcriptional behavior. Three-dimensional structural studies using electron cryomicroscopy showed that the binding of one Fab (8H2/G5) does not affect the conformation of the capsid, and the efficiency of mRNA production is similar to that of the native subviral particle.

Ninety were positive by immunochromatography and 51 were genotyped by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by nested-multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with type-specific primers. Six G9 strains and four G1 strains were sequenced by MACROGEN Korea. The phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA 6.0. The 940 bp were aligned using CLUSTALW and the tree was inferred using the UPGMA method. The antigenic dominants of VP7, 7-1a, 7-1b, and 7-2 were studied using BioEdit, 7.2.5.

The relatively new semisynthetic α-glucosyl hesperitin (GH), and the natural plant product epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) are unique among most flavonoids, as these flavonoids are highly soluble. The antiviral activity of these plant metabolites were investigated using the rotavirus as a model enteric virus system. Direct loss of virus structural integrity in cell-free suspension and titration of amplified RTV in host cell cultures was measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (qEIA). After 30 min. 100 × 103 μg/ml GH reduced RTV antigen levels by ca. 90%. The same compound reduced infectivity (replication in cell culture) by a similar order of magnitude 3 to 4 days post inoculation.

SP-D is known to interact with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the closely-related M. bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis. We speculated that due to the overall similarities between conglutinin and SP-D, conglutinin is likely to have a protective influence in bovine tuberculosis. We set out to investigate the role of conglutinin in host-pathogen interaction during mycobacterial infection. We show here that a recombinant truncated form of conglutinin (rfBC), composed of the neck and C-type lectin domains, binds specifically and in a dose-dependent manner to the model organism Mycobacterium bovis BCG. rfBC showed a significant direct bacteriostatic effect on the growth of M. bovis BCG in culture. In addition, rfBC inhibited the uptake of M. bovis BCG by THP-1 macrophages (human monocyte lineage cell line) and suppressed the subsequent pro-inflammatory response. Conglutinin is well-known as a binder of the complement activation product, iC3b. rfBC was also able to inhibit the uptake of complement-coated M. bovis BCG by THP-1 macrophages, whilst modulating the pro-inflammatory response. It is likely that rfBC inhibits the phagocytosis of mycobacteria by two distinct mechanisms: firstly, rfBC interferes with mannose receptor-mediated uptake by masking lipoarabinomannan (LAM) on the mycobacterial surface. Secondly, since conglutinin binds iC3b, it can interfere with complement receptor-mediated uptake via CR3 and CR4, by masking interactions with iC3b deposited on the mycobacterial surface. rfBC was also able to modulate the downstream pro-inflammatory response in THP-1 cells, which is important for mobilizing the adaptive immune response, facilitating containment of mycobacterial infection. In conclusion, we show that conglutinin possesses complement-dependent and complement-independent anti-mycobacterial activities, interfering with both known mechanisms of mycobacterial uptake by macrophages. As mycobacteria are specialized intracellular pathogens, conglutinin may inhibit M. bovis and M. tuberculosis from establishing an intracellular niche within macrophages, and thus, negatively affect the long-term survival of the pathogen in the host.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that a recombinant truncated form of conglutinin (rfBC), composed of the neck and C-type lectin domains, binds specifically and in a dose-dependent manner to the model organism Mycobacterium bovis BCG, interfering with both known mechanisms of mycobacterial uptake by macrophages."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7369,"details":{"paperId":"dc75bd16543159e4029de0f58a91edf8f4597ea9","externalIds":{"MAG":"2063732949","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.75.11.5335-5342.2001","CorpusId":"14194880","PubMed":"11333914"},"title":"Complete In Vitro Assembly of the Reovirus Outer Capsid Produces Highly Infectious Particles Suitable for Genetic Studies of the Receptor-Binding Protein","abstract":"ABSTRACT Mammalian reoviruses, prototype members of theReoviridae family of nonenveloped double-stranded RNA viruses, use at least three proteins—ς1, μ1, and ς3—to enter host cells. ς1, a major determinant of cell tropism, mediates viral attachment to cellular receptors.

As such, MFGM materials have been isolated and characterized as valuable ingredients for incorporation into new food products. However, MFGM are also sensitive to modification during isolation and processing, and care should be taken to standardize the composition and characteristics of the membrane to maintain its unique properties during application in food products.

However, the effects appear to be variable and dependent on physiological (animal) factors, and much remains to be learned about the phenomena on a molecular level.","publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9392,"details":{"paperId":"f1dba8d81090d761d156cf2f9c149aaeb82ae645","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"6232911","MAG":"2898335287","DOI":"10.3389/fped.2018.00313","CorpusId":"53040688","PubMed":"30460213"},"title":"Compositional Dynamics of the Milk Fat Globule and Its Role in Infant Development","abstract":"Human milk is uniquely optimized for the needs of the developing infant. Its composition is complex and dynamic, driven primarily by maternal genetics, and to a lesser extent by diet and environment. One important component that is gaining attention is the milk fat globule (MFG). The MFG is composed of a triglyceride-rich core surrounded by a tri-layer membrane, also known as the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) that originates from mammary gland epithelia. The MFGM is enriched with glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol, and proteins, some of which are glycosylated, and are known to exert numerous biological roles. Mounting evidence suggests that the structure of the MFG and bioactive components of the MFGM may benefit the infant by aiding in the structural and functional maturation of the gut through the provision of essential nutrients and/or regulating various cellular events during infant growth and immune education. Further, antimicrobial peptides and surface carbohydrate moieties surrounding the MFG might have a pivotal role in shaping gut microbial populations, which in turn may promote protection against immune and inflammatory diseases early in life. This review seeks to: (1) understand the components of the MFG, as well as maternal factors including genetic and lifestyle factors that influence its characteristics; (2) examine the potential role of this milk component on the intestinal immune system; and (3) delineate the mechanistic roles of the MFG in infant intestinal maturation and establishment of the microbiota in the alimentary canal.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The structure of the MFG and bioactive components of the MFGM may benefit the infant by aiding in the structural and functional maturation of the gut through the provision of essential nutrients and/or regulating various cellular events during infant growth and immune education."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":184,"details":{"paperId":"8568ba93fff8c6829f3d440b7398fb45c636224c","externalIds":{"MAG":"2887309043","DOI":"10.1002/cpps.75","CorpusId":"51976463","PubMed":"30106511"},"title":"Computational Prediction of Carbohydrate‐Binding Proteins and Binding Sites","abstract":"Protein‐carbohydrate interaction is essential for biological systems, and carbohydrate‐binding proteins (CBPs) are important targets when designing antiviral and anticancer drugs. Due to the high cost and difficulty associated with experimental approaches, many computational methods have been developed as complementary approaches to predict CBPs or carbohydrate‐binding sites. However, most of these computational methods are not publicly available. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of related studies and demonstrate our two recently developed bioinformatics methods. The method SPOT‐CBP is a template‐based method for detecting CBPs based on structure through structural homology search combined with a knowledge‐based scoring function. This method can yield model complex structure in addition to accurate prediction of CBPs. Furthermore, it has been observed that similarly accurate predictions can be made using structures from homology modeling, which has significantly expanded its applicability. The other method, SPRINT‐CBH, is a de novo approach that predicts binding residues directly from protein sequences by using sequence information and predicted structural properties. This approach does not need structurally similar templates and thus is not limited by the current database of known protein‐carbohydrate complex structures.

Methods: A whey-based EHF (Test formula) containing 2′fucosyl-lactose (2′FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) was assessed for clinical hypoallergenicity and safety. The Control formula was a currently marketed EHF without HMO.

The application of controlled human challenge models of infection and disease at the appropriate stages of development could accelerate development of candidate vaccines and, in fact, has done so successfully in some limited cases.

We prepared this report to motivate fellow scientists to exploit the potential capacity of controlled human challenge experiments to advance vaccine development. In this review, we considered available challenge models for 17 infectious diseases in the context of the public health importance of each disease, the diversity and pathogenesis of the causative organisms, the vaccine candidates under development, and each model’s capacity to evaluate them and identify correlates of protective immunity.

In spite of such a huge disease burden, still no effective antivirals are available against rotavirus. Cordycepin (3’-deoxyadenosine), an adenosine analogue, has been reported to modulate cell proliferation, platelet aggregation and provide protection against HIV infection. Herein, attempts were made to analyze efficacy of cordycepin for protection against rotavirus and underlying mechanism. \nMethods \nCordycepin’s anti-rotaviral activity was elucidated against simian rotavirus strain SA11 (H96), rhesus strain RRV, human strain Wa (in vitro) and murine strain EW (in BALB/c). Plaque assay, qPCR for viral transcripts and immunoblotting of viral proteins were done to examine viral abundance. Effect of cordycepin on Interferon pathway was analyzed by immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation and molecular docking. \nResults \nCordycepin was found to reduce propagation of different rotavirus strains such as SA11, RRV, Wa at 64μM with minimal cytotoxicity in vitro and EW in BALB/c mice. Protection was obtained upto 24 hours, after virus infection at both low and high multiplicity of infection. Sensitivity of rotavirus infection to Interferons has been documented. In cordycepin treated cells increased induction of Interferon and downstream antiviral proteins were observed. Cordycepin treatment leads to RIGI-MAVS interaction, IRF3 activation, and Interferon induction. By using different software probable docking sites and orientation of cordycepin and RIG-I were predicted. Cordycepin was found to have relatively higher binding probability for ATP binding domain than other domains. In Vero cells,deficient in Interferon signalling, cordycepin failed to protect against rotavirus.

Induction of full immune restoration in chronically infected individuals, including HIV-specific helper T cell responses, is considered a priority, particularly if immunological control of HIV is to be achieved. Regimens containing dual protease inhibitors (PIs) have provided greater suppression of viremia than single-PI regimens. We therefore conducted a prospective analysis of factors associated with immune restoration after 3 years of therapy in two cohorts of acutely and chronically HIV-infected patients, comparing dual- versus single-PI regimens. Earlier and more durable returns of p24-specific proliferation were demonstrated in patients receiving dual-PI compared with single-PI regimens. Individuals with restored p24 responses had larger reductions in total HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) associated with stronger viral suppression, but Gag-specific CTLs remained higher, demonstrating that Gag-specific helper T cell responses were a critical component of functional immune restoration. On examination of clinical factors associated with immune restoration, we demonstrated that decreasing activation of CD8+ T cells (%CD8+ CD38+) and increasing proportions of CD4+ T cells were independently associated with restoration of p24 responses. Minimal immune activation, resulting from maximal suppression of viral replication, was required for long-term restoration and maintenance of Gag-specific T cell responses.

In this study, using a novel FACS assay, we have directly studied the phenotype of B cells that express surface RV-specific Ig during the in vivo RV immune response. During primary infection, RV-specific B cells first appear as large IgD−B220lowα4β7− and α4β7+ cells (presumptive extrafollicular, Ab-secreting B cells), and then as large and small IgD−B220highα4β7− cells (presumptive germinal center B cells). The appearance of B cells with the phenotype of large IgD−B220lowα4β7+ cells in PP and most notably in mesenteric lymph nodes coincides with the emergence of RV-specific Ab-secreting cells (ASC) in the ILP. Thus, these B lymphocytes are good candidates for the migratory population giving rise to the RV-specific ASC in the ILP. RV-specific long-term memory B cells preferentially accumulate in PP and express α4β7. Nine months after infection most RV-specific IgA ASC are found in PP and ILP and at lower frequency in bone marrow and spleen. This study is the first to follow changes in tissue-specific homing receptor expression during Ag-specific B cell development in response to a natural host, tissue-specific pathogen. These results show that α4β7 is tightly regulated during the Ag-specific B cell response to RV and is expressed concurrently with the specific migration of memory and effector B cells to intestinal tissues.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results show that α4β7 is tightly regulated during the Ag-specific B cell response to RV and is expressed concurrently with the specific migration of memory and effector B cells to intestinal tissues."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3210,"details":{"paperId":"8699ff92b8ad53254f07d14243d2e2166795480b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8631456","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.075","CorpusId":"243842039","PubMed":"34753614"},"title":"Cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in the Philippines: A modeling study","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Both Rotavac and Rotasiil are likely to be cost-effective options in the Philippines, but it is not possible to say definitively which product should be preferred."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8275,"details":{"paperId":"8748e9fa724c6d3e34073af5bce7206c6adae662","externalIds":{"MAG":"1992709878","PubMedCentral":"3967954","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0002758","CorpusId":"28041833","PubMed":"24675990"},"title":"Could Nitazoxanide Be Added to Other Essential Medicines for Integrated Neglected Tropical Disease Control and Elimination?","abstract":"In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) determined that more than 700 million people were treated with at least one essential medicine for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) under the auspices of a global preventive chemotherapy initiative [1,2]. However, a total of at least 1.9 billion people require annual preventive chemotherapy [1,2], so these efforts will need to be greatly expanded in order to meet NTD control and elimination targets as outlined in the 2012 London Declaration and the 2013 World Health Assembly resolution for these diseases [3]. The original ‘‘rapid-impact’’ package of NTD interventions targeted up to seven NTDs highly endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, including the three soil-transmitted helminthiases, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma, and was comprised of up to four essential NTD medicines that could include a benzimidazole anthelminthic drug (i.e., mebendazole or albendazole), ivermectin, praziquantel, and/or azithromycin [4,5]. However, it was quickly noted that either the entire rapid-impact package or some component thereof had applicability outside of Africa (with modifications depending on the specific NTDs being targeted) [6]. By controlling or eliminating the seven major NTDs, this approach could potentially effect a global disease burden reduction almost as important as HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria control [7,8]. As global preventive chemotherapy efforts expanded, it also became apparent that they could produce important collateral public health benefits that were not originally anticipated, including overall reductions in child mortality from the azithromycin component [9] and coverage for additional NTDs such as food-borne trematodiases, scabies, and yaws [3,10,11]. There are equally important efforts underway to broaden the interventions to include water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) initiatives [12]. Thus, in the decade since rapid impact was originally proposed, there are new uses and approaches for preventive chemotherapy. In the last year, two important studies were published that could alter how we think about current preventive chemotherapy approaches. The first, known as the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) for diarrheal diseases, made the surprising finding that cryptosporidiosis is one of the most important causes of infectious diarrhea in children in developing countries [13]. The second is the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), which found that, together, cryptosporidiosis and amoebiasis exceed the disease burden–as measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) or in deaths—of any helminth infection now currently being targeted for preventive chemotherapy (Table 1) [14,15]. Although there are important disagreements in the NTD community about whether the DALYs for helminth infections (and other NTDs) were underestimated [16], both GEMS and GBD 2010 provide important information to our community that we need to consider in deciding whether it is possible to add coverage for cryptosporidiosis and amoebiasis as part of global preventive chemotherapy efforts. A potential candidate drug for use in mass drug administration programs to target intestinal protozoa is the nitrothiazole benzamide drug, nitazoxanide (Figure 1) [17]. The development program for nitazoxanide was led by Jean Francois Rossignol in the 1970s, initially as a veterinary anthelminthic agent, but the drug was subsequently shown to be active against intestinal protozoa and some human helminths, as well as anaerobic bacteria [17]. It was approved in 2002 by the United States Food and Drug Administration, initially as an oral suspension for pediatric use (100 mg/5 ml) against cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, and subsequently as 500 mg tablets for adults [17]. According to The Medical Letter, the recommended therapeutic dosage is administered over three days [18]. Although the initial indication for nitazoxanide was for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, subsequent investigative research has revealed that the drug is effective for amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica and could be used to treat both invasive intestinal amoebiasis and colonization with E. histolytica [19].

The self-assembly of the coat protein mutants of TBSV resulted in two types of nanoparticles: small (60 subunit) and the regular size (180 subunit) capsids. These protein shells (capsids) can be used for the display of 60-180 copies of peptides/proteins of the pathogens of concern. Previously, it has been shown that antibodies raised against various cytotoxins (e.g., ricin and Shiga toxin) render protection against the potential toxin attack. The proposed polyvalent reagents, which display various peptide/protein fragments of ricin would act as prophylactic vaccines of the ricin toxin.

This article covers a comprehensive review of different synthesis approaches of ZnO-NPs including physical, chemical, biochemical, and green synthesis techniques, and also emphasizes their biopotency through antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiviral, wound healing, and cardioprotective activity. Green synthesis from plants, bacteria, and fungus is given special attention, with a particular emphasis on extraction techniques, precursors used for the synthesis and reaction conditions, characterization techniques, and surface morphology of the particles.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This article covers a comprehensive review of different synthesis approaches of ZnO-NPs including physical, chemical, biochemical, and green synthesis techniques, and emphasizes their biopotency through antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiviral, wound healing, and cardioprotective activity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":868,"details":{"paperId":"d318a179a5fa36a7085ee028a676a209e6757b80","externalIds":{"MAG":"170819478","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-007-6214-5_10","CorpusId":"82224941"},"title":"Current Status and Biomedical Applications of Ribosome-Inactivating Proteins","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This chapter will mainly focus on plant RIPs with the aim to report some of the most promising biomedical applications currently under investigation and further discuss their future perspectives."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9579,"details":{"paperId":"bc82a5c194c674a2a9498668670e133356448399","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8399003","DOI":"10.3390/microorganisms9081599","CorpusId":"237327983","PubMed":"34442677"},"title":"Current and Future Antiviral Strategies to Tackle Gastrointestinal Viral Infections","abstract":"Acute gastroenteritis caused by virus has a major impact on public health worldwide in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic burden.

Currently, there is no specific drug available against rotavirus, largely due to the lack of an ideal target molecule which has hampered drug development. Our previous studies have revealed that cyclosporin A (CsA) might be potentially useful as an anti-RV drug. We therefore used both cellular and mouse models to study the immunological safety and effectiveness of CsA as an anti-RV drug. We found that CsA treatment of HT-29 cells before, during, and after viral infection efficiently inhibited Wa strain RV replication and restored IFN-β expression in a HT-29 cell line model. Exploring the underlying mechanisms showed that CsA promoted Interferon Regulatory Factor-5 (IRF-5) expression (a key positive regulator of the type I IFN signaling pathway), but not IRF-1, IRF-3, or IRF-7. Additionally, CsA inhibited SOCS-1 expression (the key negative regulator of IFN-α/β), but not SOCS-2 or SOCS-3. The antiviral effect of CsA was confirmed in an RV-infected neonatal mouse model by evaluation of antigen clearance and assessment of changes in intestinal tissue pathology. Also, no differences in T cell frequency or proliferation between the CsA- and vehicle-treated groups were observed. Thus, both our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that CsA, through modulating the expression of key regulators in IFN signaling pathway, promote type I IFN-based intracellular innate immunity in RV host cells. These findings suggest that CsA may be a useful candidate to develop a new anti-RV strategy, although further evaluation and characterization of CsA on RV-induced diarrhea are warranted.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Both in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that CsA, through modulating the expression of key regulators in IFN signaling pathway, promote type I IFN-based intracellular innate immunity in RV host cells."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":643,"details":{"paperId":"36dac84728b170ec67c040089e15084c7a202b5e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2788781190","DOI":"10.1007/164_2018_103","CorpusId":"4923720","PubMed":"29460152"},"title":"Cystic Fibrosis, Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator and Drugs: Insights from Cellular Trafficking.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An understanding of cellular protein/lipid trafficking pathways has opened up strategies for increasing drug bioavailability and approaches to enhance endosomal exit have greatly increased the cytosolic bioavailability of drugs and will provide a means of investigating previous drugs that may have been shelved due to their low cytosol concentration."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6361,"details":{"paperId":"fed4c83ff35d66ef4234ea46d2264d66afee87e6","externalIds":{"MAG":"2736430908","DOI":"10.1111/liv.13530","CorpusId":"9363365","PubMed":"28746782"},"title":"Cytoplasmic rods and rings in mycophenolic acid treatment","abstract":"As highlighted in a recent review in Liver International, ribavirin (RBV) retains an important role in the interferon-free era of HCV treatment.

Several studies have shown that rice bran (RB) supplementation provides nutrients and modulates gut inflammation, which may reduce risk for undernutrition. Objective The aim was to evaluate the effect of daily RB dietary supplementation for 6 mo on serum biomarkers in weaning infants and associated changes in serum and stool metabolites. Methods A 6-mo randomized-controlled dietary intervention was conducted in a cohort of weaning 6-mo-old infants in León, Nicaragua. Anthropometric indices were obtained at 6, 8, and 12 mo. Serum and stool ionomics and metabolomics were completed at the end of the 6-mo intervention using inductively coupled plasma MS and ultra-high performance LC–tandem MS. The ɑ1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein, and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) serum EED biomarkers were measured by ELISA. Results Twenty-four infants in the control group and 23 in the RB group successfully completed the 6-mo dietary intervention with 90% dietary compliance. RB participants had higher concentrations of GLP-2 as compared with control participants at 12 mo [median (IQR): 743.53 (380.54) pg/mL vs. 592.50 (223.59) pg/mL; P = 0.04].

ABSTRACT Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are acute viral gastroenteritis pathogens that affect all age groups, yet no approved vaccines and drugs to treat HuNoV infection are available. In this study, we screened an antiviral compound library to identify compound(s) showing anti-HuNoV activity using a human intestinal enteroid (HIE) culture system in which HuNoVs are able to replicate reproducibly.

To accomplish this objective, four probiotic bacterial strains of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were tested. Probiotic extracts were obtained after bacterial growth, cell lysis and centrifugation. Obtained probiotic extracts were used in assays to interfere with adhesion and penetration of a RV strain in the mammal cell line MA104. Furthermore, the interaction between probiotic extracts and MA104 cell receptors was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation assays using anti-ß3-integrins and anti-Hsc70 antibodies. All four probiotic, protein-rich, extracts reduced RV infections in MA104 cells, suggesting a successful antiviral activity mediated by these probiotic extracts. All probiotic extracts significantly exerted thir antiviral activity by interfering with RV adhesion on MA104 cell receptors, with proteins in probiotic extracts competitively interacting with cell surface receptors necessary to RV infection. Co-immunoprecipitation assay results showed that proteins in probiotic extracts were able to bind to ß3-integrinsand Hsc70, which are two cellular receptors required to viral infection. The most significant contribution of this study is an insight into the mechanisms of probiotic antiviral activity, thus expanding current probiotics fundamental knowledge.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An insight is gained into the mechanisms of probiotic antiviral activity, thus expanding current probiotics fundamental knowledge."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2439,"details":{"paperId":"bcab16282692aec3ef75e0e9d155889f9acfd210","externalIds":{"MAG":"2301419760","DOI":"10.1016/J.IDAIRYJ.2016.03.001","CorpusId":"88348134"},"title":"Defatted bovine milk fat globule membrane inhibits association of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 with human HT-29 cells","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A defatted bovine MFGM fraction is generated, rich in proteins and glycoproteins, and demonstrated its ability to prevent the association of several enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 strains with human colonic adenocarcinoma, HT-29 cells."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4638,"details":{"paperId":"db6fe3afc206d4b6c0b150b3fb1dc0385e97cfc7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2002564770","DOI":"10.1056/NEJMp0905091","CorpusId":"205105417","PubMed":"19907040"},"title":"Defeating rotavirus?

As a result, there is growing interest in the synthesis of HMOs mimicking their natural diversity. Most HMOs are fucosylated oligosaccharides. α-l-Fucosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of α-l-fucose from the non-reducing end of a glucan. They fall into the glycoside hydrolase GH29 and GH95 families. The GH29 family fucosidases display a classic retaining mechanism and are good candidates for transfucosidase activity. We recently demonstrated that the α-l-fucosidase from Thermotoga maritima (TmαFuc) from the GH29 family can be evolved into an efficient transfucosidase by directed evolution ( Osanjo et al. 2007). In this work, we developed semi-rational approaches to design an α-l-transfucosidase starting with the α-l-fucosidase from commensal bacteria Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (BiAfcB, Blon_2336). Efficient fucosylation was obtained with enzyme mutants (L321P-BiAfcB and F34I/L321P-BiAfcB) enabling in vitro synthesis of lactodifucotetraose, lacto-N-fucopentaose II, lacto-N-fucopentaose III and lacto-N-difucohexaose I. The enzymes also generated more complex HMOs like fucosylated para-lacto-N-neohexaose (F-p-LNnH) and mono- or difucosylated lacto-N-neohexaose (F-LNnH-I, F-LNnH-II and DF-LNnH). It is worth noting that mutation at these two positions did not result in a strong decrease in the overall activity of the enzyme, which makes these variants interesting candidates for large-scale transfucosylation reactions.

In translational research projects, we have focused on the discovery of lead compounds for three major diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD), breast cancer, and viral infections. In the AD project, we have taken a rational‐design approach and synthesized a new class of tricyclic pyrone (TP) compounds that preserve memory and motor functions in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin‐1 (PS1) mice. TPs could protect neuronal death through several possible mechanisms, including their ability to inhibit the formation of both intraneuronal and extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates, to increase cholesterol efflux, to restore axonal trafficking, and to enhance long‐term potentiation (LTP) and restored LTP following treatment with Aβ oligomers. We have also synthesized a new class of gap‐junction enhancers, based on substituted quinolines, that possess potent inhibitory activities against breast‐cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Although various antiviral drugs are available, the emergence of viral resistance to existing antiviral drugs and various understudied viral infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, emphasizes the demand for the development of new antiviral agents against such infections and others.

We developed a specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent blocking assay to detect antibody to group B rotaviruses that will be useful to assess the role of group B rotavirus infections as a cause of human gastroenteritis. We tested 219 human sera and 18 immunoglobulin pools collected from eight countries for antibodies to both group A and group B rotaviruses. Overall, a low proportion (10 of 237 or 4.2%) of sera contained antibody to group B rotaviruses. Antibody to group B rotavirus was detected in only 1 of 155 serum samples from healthy or hospitalized individuals in the United States, including patients with the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. No antibody was detected in 15 serum samples from Australia and from an outbreak of gastroenteritis on a cruise ship or in nine immunoglobulin pools from Japan and the United Kingdom. Antibody to group B rotaviruses was detected in 8 convalescent-(but not acute-)phase serum samples from Chinese patients with group B gastroenteritis, in five immunoglobulin pools from China, in 1 of 6 serum samples from Chinese students in the United States, and in 1 each of 10 serum samples from Kenya, 20 from Thailand, and 15 from Canada. In contrast, most of these samples (226 of 237 or 95.4%) had antibody to group A rotaviruses.

The functional form of P-gp in its native state is not known. Previous results from radiation target size analysis have suggested that P-gp occurs as dimers in MDR cell plasma membranes [Boscoboinik et al. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1027, 225-228]. In this study, we used sucrose gradient velocity sedimentation to determine if P-gp oligomers could be retrieved from detergent extracts of hamster and human MDR cell lines. The proportion of P-gp recovered as higher order oligomers was dependent on the detergents used for solubilization of the cells. When a detergent such as CHAPS was used, 50% or more of the P-gp sedimented as higher order oligomers. In contrast, in the presence of SDS, only monomers were retrieved, but naturally occurring oligomers could be preserved if the cells were treated with a cross-linker prior to detergent solubilization. The oligomers and monomers were both able to bind the photoactive analog of ATP (8-azido[alpha-32P]ATP) or the drug [3H]azidopine in membrane preparations. P-gp is a phosphoprotein, and its phosphorylated state is thought to be important for function. When MDR cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivo, we observed that the monomer and dimer were more highly phosphorylated than the larger oligomers, suggesting that these different forms of P-gp may be functionally distinct. The assembly of oligomers appears to occur in an early bisynthetic compartment, and asparagine-linked glycosylation is not required for their formation. Our findings indicate that oligomers of P-gp exist in MDR cells and raise the possibility that the dynamics of oligomer formation and dissociation may be important in the mechanism of action of P-gp.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The findings indicate that oligomers of P-gp exist in MDR cells and raise the possibility that the dynamics of oligomer formation and dissociation may be important in the mechanism of action ofP-gp."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1642,"details":{"paperId":"8d7197e83d948cd3ae6ccbb15fa6a1ab1a62628e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2078154622","DOI":"10.1016/0166-0934(89)90012-8","CorpusId":"20115284","PubMed":"2547808"},"title":"Determination of rotavirus serotype-specific antibodies in sera by competitive enhanced enzyme immunoassay.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was developed in which rotavirus serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies against VP7 compete with antibodies in test sera for rotav virus serType-specific antigen bound to a solid phase."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2209,"details":{"paperId":"2e3612037eaed345b093b84be02992ffcfa209d6","externalIds":{"MAG":"2011194210","DOI":"10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2011.09.003","CorpusId":"20709650","PubMed":"21945566"},"title":"Determining the effect of the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into antimicrobial peptides on the interactions with zwitterionic and anionic membrane model systems.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Evidence suggests that as the length of Spacer# 1 increases the mechanism of pore formation also changes and these AMPs are potential candidates for further drug development."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3204,"details":{"paperId":"0c7a0c6014937f7bb61b9c65139bce256ee06151","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8062787","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.033","CorpusId":"232308954","PubMed":"33744044"},"title":"Developing a manufacturing process to deliver a cost effective and stable liquid human rotavirus vaccine","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A low-cost manufacturing process for a neonatal rotavirus vaccine was developed that resulted in a stable liquid vaccine at 2–8 °C with no pretreatment of vaccinees with antacid needed before oral administration."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5186,"details":{"paperId":"6e0797516e274c63e6571b7eb2003d583c5452f3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2549887608","DOI":"10.1089/VIM.2016.0073","CorpusId":"42903900","PubMed":"27860553"},"title":"Developing an Inactivated Rotavirus Vaccine and Evaluating the Immunogenicity Against a Commercially Available Attenuated Rotavirus Vaccine Using a Mice Animal Model.","abstract":"There is a high demand for public immunization against Rotavirus (RV), especially in Africa.

Notably, the combination using compounds 4a/4d and oseltamivir carboxylate or zanamivir displayed synergistic antiviral effects against oseltamivir-resistant strains. Mode-of-action analysis demonstrated that compounds 4a/4d acted at the late phase of the viral infection cycle through inhibiting viral RNA transcription and replication. Further experiments showed that treatment with compounds 4a/4d significantly inhibited influenza virus infection in human lung organoids, suggesting the druggability of the novel thiazolides. In-depth transcriptome analysis revealed a series of upregulated cellular genes that may contribute to the antiviral activities of 4a/4d.

Oral administration of 2 x 10(3) PFU of passage 9 also consistently caused infection of mice 4, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 days of age as determined by viral shedding and seroconversion. Reinoculation of these mice with the same virus preparation at 2, 3, or 4 months after the first inoculation produced no evidence of reinfection. In contrast, infection of neonatal mice with the heterotypic WC3 bovine rotavirus did not prevent reinfection with culture-adapted EDIM. Thus, this strain of EDIM caused consistent infection of previously uninoculated neonatal and adult BALB/c mice and produced homotypic but not heterotypic protection against reinfection.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This strain of mouse rotavirus adapted to grow in culture by multiple passages in MA104 cells caused consistent infection of previously uninoculated neonatal and adult BALB/c mice and produced homotypes but not heterotypic protection against reinfection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1646,"details":{"paperId":"a20be5a917e38acd635321ea6c79e9a54793ca46","externalIds":{"MAG":"2042510009","DOI":"10.1016/0166-0934(91)90013-P","CorpusId":"4008076","PubMed":"1658027"},"title":"Development of an improved method for measuring neutralizing antibody to rotavirus.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An improved assay was developed for measuring neutralizing antibody titers against rotaviruses that was less laborious and the results are obtained by objective rather than subjective methods, and represents an improvement over the FRN assay."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9945,"details":{"paperId":"afe762e0aa2c4dda6c4ca6076d36e0be79c46949","externalIds":{"MAG":"2565446478","DOI":"10.3920/BM2016.0155","CorpusId":"1695268","PubMed":"28042704"},"title":"Development of an in vitro immunobiotic evaluation system against rotavirus infection in bovine intestinal epitheliocytes.","abstract":"The bovine intestinal epithelial cell line (BIE cells) expresses the Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 and is able to mount an antiviral immune response after the stimulation with poly(I:C).

Rat pups were inoculated with IDIR virus (a group B rotavirus) at 10 d of age. Beginning 2 d postinfection, in addition to maternal milk, group CM received a daily gavage of cow milk and group GG received Lactobacillus casei strain GG, a human strain previously shown to survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and temporarily colonize the gut. Group CMGG received a combination of these, and control animals were gavaged with tap water. At 21 d of age, jejunal absorption of intact and degraded horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in Ussing chamber was markedly higher in IDIR virus-infected than in noninfected controls. In the two groups gavaged with cow milk, group CM and group CMGG, the numbers of specific antibody-secreting cells (enumerated by the solid-phase enzyme-linked immunospot assay) against β-lactoglobulin were significantly higher than in the groups that had not received cow milk. In parallel with immune system activation, a statistically significant increase in the absorption of intact HRP (mean and 95% confidence interval, ng × h−1 × cm−2) was detected: group CM, 302 (155, 586); group CMGG, 174 (56, 545); infected controls, 121 (57, 257); and group GG, 44 (8, 254). A decrease in the uptake of intact HRP (F = 3.64, p = 0.06) and degraded HRP (F = 9.50, p = 0.004) was associated with the introduction of L. casei GG to the diet, irrespective of coexposure to cow milk.

Methods: Male 18-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a semipurified diet containing 20% (w/w) fat. The control diet contained triglyceride, reflecting the fat formulation of an existing infant formula. Two experimental diets were formulated by adding sphingomyelin (1% w/w of total fat) or a ganglioside-enriched lipid (0.1% w/w of total fat) to the control diet fat. The ganglioside fraction of ganglioside-enriched lipid diet contained more than 80% GD3.

Results: The ganglioside-enriched lipid diet significantly increased total gangliosides in the intestinal mucosa, plasma and brain compared with the control diet. The ganglioside-enriched lipid diet significantly increased the level of GD3 (7.5% w/w) in the intestine compared with control (3.2% w/w) while decreasing the level of GM3, the major ganglioside in the intestine.

The effects of RB on rotavirus diarrhea and immunogenicity of an attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine were evaluated in gnotobiotic pigs. The four treatment groups studied were RB plus vaccine, vaccine only, RB only, and mock control. Pigs in the RB groups were fed the amount of RB that replaced 10% of the pigs' total daily calorie intake from milk starting from 5 days of age until they were euthanized. Pigs in the vaccine groups were orally inoculated with two doses of the attenuated HRV vaccine. A subset of pigs from each group was orally challenged with the homologous virulent HRV on postinoculation day 28. Diarrhea and virus shedding were monitored daily from postchallenge day 0 to day 7. RB feeding significantly protected against diarrhea upon virulent HRV challenge and enhanced the protective rate of the vaccine against rotavirus diarrhea. Consistent with protection, RB significantly increased gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, RB also increased the number of total IgM- and IgA-secreting cells, total serum IgM, IgG, and IgA titers, and HRV-specific IgA titers in intestinal contents. RB reduced the numbers of intestinal and systemic HRV-specific IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells and reduced serum HRV-specific IgA and IgG antibody titers before the challenge.

These subtle variations in the presentation or accessibility of the RV VP6 capsid layer led to position-specific differences in occupancy for binding of the RV6-25 antibody.

Recently, we demonstrated that breastmilk from mothers in India had significantly higher IgA and neutralizing activity against rotavirus that could reduce the effective titer of rotavirus vaccines reaching the gut when compared with that from mothers in the United States. We extended our study to understand the specific contribution of those nonantibody components in breastmilk to the neutralizing activity against rotavirus vaccine we observed. Methods: Breastmilk samples were collected from mothers of breast-feeding infants aged between 4 and 29 weeks (ie, vaccine eligible age) in India (N = 40), South Africa (N = 50) and the United States (N = 51). We examined breastmilk for lactoferrin, lactadherin, rotavirus-specific IgA and neutralizing activity against 3 rotavirus vaccine strains (Rotarix, RotaTeq G1 and 116E) using enzyme immunoassays, a plaque reduction assay or a microneutralization assay. Results: We observed higher levels of lactoferrin, lactadherin, IgA and neutralizing activity in breastmilk specimens from Indian and South African women than those from American women. We demonstrated positive associations between levels of lactoferrin or IgA and neutralizing activity in Indian and South African specimens, but not in American specimens. We demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of lactoferrin was dose- or species-dependent, as evidenced by greater reduction in titer of Rotarix and 116E by human lactoferrin. Lactadherin also exhibited inhibitory activity to rotavirus vaccines but appeared to be less effective. Conclusions: The lower immunogenicity and efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in developing countries could be explained, in part, by synergistic inhibitory effect of high levels of antibody and nonantibody components in breastmilk consumed by infants at the time of immunization.

Since 2013, the German Standing Committee on vaccination recommended the routine rotavirus vaccination for infants in Germany. While vaccination has significantly decreased RVA cases and worldwide mortality, in some cases, infants can develop acute gastroenteritis as an adverse reaction after immunization with an attenuated live vaccine. Pediatricians, as well as clinicians and diagnostic laboratories, contacted the Consultant Laboratory for Rotaviruses and inquired whether cases of RVA-positive AGE after vaccination were associated with vaccine or with wild-type RVA strains. A testing algorithm based on distinguishing PCRs and confirmative sequencing was designed, tested, and applied. Diagnostic samples from 68 vaccinated children and six cases where horizontal transmission was suspected were investigated in this study. Using a combination of real-time PCR, fragment-length analysis of amplicons from multiplex PCRs and confirmative sequencing, vaccine-like virus was detected in 46 samples and wild-type RVA was detected in 6 samples. Three mixed infections of vaccine and wild-type RVA were detectable, no RVA genome was found in 19 samples. High viral loads (>1.0 × 107 copies/g stool) were measured in most RVA-positive samples. Furthermore, information on co-infections with other AGE pathogens in the vaccinated study population was of interest. A commercial multiplex PCR and in-house PCRs revealed three co-infections of vaccinated infants with bacteria (two samples with Clostridioides difficile and one sample with enteropathogenic E. coli) and six co-infections with norovirus in a subset of the samples.

Human milk also contains a plethora of bioactive molecules, including a large set of human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs). Especially fucosylated hMOs have received attention for their anti-adhesive effects on pathogens by preventing attachment to the intestinal wall. Because hMOs are generally challenging to produce in sufficient quantities to study and ultimately apply in (medical) infant formula, hMO mimics are interesting compounds to produce and evaluate for their biological effects. Methods and results We investigated the digestion, fermentation, and pathogen anti-adhesive capacity of the novel hMO mimic di-fucosyl-β-cyclodextrin (DFβCD). We establish that DFβCD is not digested by α-amylase and also resists fermentation by the microbiota from a 9 month-old infant. In addition, we reveal that DFβCD blocks adhesion of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) to Caco-2 cells, especially when DFβCD is pre-incubated with ETEC prior to addition to the Caco-2 cells.

We conducted active, population-based surveillance for rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalizations in 3 US counties to assess vaccine impact.\n\n\nMETHODS\nChildren <36 months old hospitalized with diarrhea and/or vomiting were enrolled from January through June each year during the period 2006-2009 and tested for rotavirus. Age-stratified rates of hospitalization for rotavirus infection were compared with corresponding vaccination coverage among a control group of children with acute respiratory illness. To assess direct and indirect benefits, vaccination coverage rates in the control group were multiplied by vaccine effectiveness estimates to calculate expected reductions in the rate of hospitalization for rotavirus infection. Rotavirus serotypes were compared across years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with 2006, a significant reduction in rates of hospitalization for rotavirus infection (P < .001) was observed in 2008 among all age groups. There was an 87% reduction in the 6-11-month-old age group (coverage, 77%), a 96% reduction in the 12-23-months-old age group (coverage, 46%), and a 92% reduction in the 24-35-month-old age group (coverage, 1%), which exceeded reductions expected on the basis of coverage and vaccine effectiveness estimates. Age-specific rate reductions were nearly equivalent to those expected on the basis of age-specific vaccine coverage in 2009. Predominant strains varied annually: G1P[8] (91%) in 2006; G1P[8] (45%) and G12P[8] (36%) in 2007; G1P[8] (89%) in 2008; and G3P[8] (43%), G2P[4] (34%), and G9P[8] (27%) in 2009.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRotavirus vaccination has dramatically decreased rates of hospitalization for rotavirus infection among children in these US counties. In 2008, reductions were prominent among both vaccine-eligible age groups and older, largely unvaccinated children; the latter likely resulted from indirect protection. Although rates among age groups eligible for vaccination remained low in 2009, indirect benefits disappeared.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Rotavirus vaccination has dramatically decreased rates of hospitalization for rotavirus infection among children in these US counties in 2008 and although rates among age groups eligible for vaccination remained low in 2009, indirect benefits disappeared."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3183,"details":{"paperId":"6c19e430a7e8046b85e4d32111259880ebd37108","externalIds":{"MAG":"2805271490","PubMedCentral":"6238204","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.04.030","CorpusId":"47010425","PubMed":"29887320"},"title":"Direct and possible indirect effects of vaccination on rotavirus hospitalisations among children in Malawi four years after programmatic introduction","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Prevalence of rotavirus in hospitalised children with AGE has declined significantly and the observed overall effect of the vaccine was 9% greater than expected according to vaccine coverage and efficacy estimates."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2459,"details":{"paperId":"3d46e6443b7e0cf3b429abdaa189311b38a587dd","externalIds":{"MAG":"2980655992","PubMedCentral":"7128205","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.018","CorpusId":"208484152","PubMed":"32081774"},"title":"Discovery and development of safe-in-man broad-spectrum antiviral agents","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2332,"details":{"paperId":"2cb20a915c836fbf3c7a4f47f792be19feba933f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2033947025","DOI":"10.1016/j.drudis.2007.10.023","CorpusId":"5391963","PubMed":"18342803"},"title":"Discovery of tight junction modulators: significance for drug development and delivery.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A variety of chemical and molecular biological tools have been developed, including high throughput cell-based screening of molecular libraries that facilitate discovery of novel peptides and lipids to modulate tight junction function safely and reversibly."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2978,"details":{"paperId":"07370e8230d186969799c179a57bbe9194005996","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.sbi.2008.07.006","CorpusId":"140079685","PubMed":"18706999"},"title":"Disease-associated carbohydrate-recognising proteins and structure-based inhibitor design.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The appearance of H5N1 avian influenza virus has re-stimulated much research on influenza virus haemagglutinin and sialidase, providing new opportunity for the development of Group 1-specific anti-influenza drugs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":972,"details":{"paperId":"d2825cd239ee70e688cb3fb15719a6e06db475ac","externalIds":{"MAG":"2050685570","DOI":"10.1007/BF01314725","CorpusId":"35535575","PubMed":"6816193"},"title":"Disintegration of retroviruses by chelating agents","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Exposurein vitro of various mammalian retroviruses to the chelating agents EDTA or EGTA in millimolar concentrations resulted in partial disintegration of viral membranes as measured by accessibility or even release of reverse transcriptase, an internal viral protein, without any other treatment usually required."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3445,"details":{"paperId":"7aed31395069d9f35836a86317e259a07c21a87e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2995288882","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2019.12.003","CorpusId":"211113668","PubMed":"32056718"},"title":"Disrupting the association of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus Ac93 with cellular ESCRT-III/Vps4 hinders nuclear egress of nucleocapsids and intranuclear microvesicles formation.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study found that Ac93, a baculovirus core protein, contains a conserved MIM1-like motif, and it is proposed that the coordinated action of these viral proteins and ESCRT-III/Vps4 may be involved in remodeling the nuclear membrane."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8519,"details":{"paperId":"d5489d9baff2d42ae55e12c210d0c80a75a67188","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4672896","MAG":"2195485567","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1005321","CorpusId":"16644170","PubMed":"26646790"},"title":"Disruption of Specific RNA-RNA Interactions in a Double-Stranded RNA Virus Inhibits Genome Packaging and Virus Infectivity","abstract":"Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes hemorrhagic disease in economically important livestock. The BTV genome is organized into ten discrete double-stranded RNA molecules (S1-S10) which have been suggested to follow a sequential packaging pathway from smallest to largest segment during virus capsid assembly. To substantiate and extend these studies, we have investigated the RNA sorting and packaging mechanisms with a new experimental approach using inhibitory oligonucleotides. Putative packaging signals present in the 3’untranslated regions of BTV segments were targeted by a number of nuclease resistant oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) and their effects on virus replication in cell culture were assessed. ORNs complementary to the 3’ UTR of BTV RNAs significantly inhibited virus replication without affecting protein synthesis. Same ORNs were found to inhibit complex formation when added to a novel RNA-RNA interaction assay which measured the formation of supramolecular complexes between and among different RNA segments. ORNs targeting the 3’UTR of BTV segment 10, the smallest RNA segment, were shown to be the most potent and deletions or substitution mutations of the targeted sequences diminished the RNA complexes and abolished the recovery of viable viruses using reverse genetics. Cell-free capsid assembly/RNA packaging assay also confirmed that the inhibitory ORNs could interfere with RNA packaging and further substitution mutations within the putative RNA packaging sequence have identified the recognition sequence concerned. Exchange of 3’UTR between segments have further demonstrated that RNA recognition was segment specific, most likely acting as part of the secondary structure of the entire genomic segment. Our data confirm that genome packaging in this segmented dsRNA virus occurs via the formation of supramolecular complexes formed by the interaction of specific sequences located in the 3’ UTRs. Additionally, the inhibition of packaging in-trans with inhibitory ORNs suggests this that interaction is a bona fide target for the design of compounds with antiviral activity.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data confirm that genome packaging in this segmented dsRNA virus occurs via the formation of supramolecular complexes formed by the interaction of specific sequences located in the 3’ UTRs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4760,"details":{"paperId":"7b321c7b32628f74c3691e64e1712bc4a045c2a5","externalIds":{"MAG":"2258018274","DOI":"10.1074/jbc.M100384200","CorpusId":"25363435","PubMed":"11274152"},"title":"Disruption of the Interaction of Mammalian Protein Synthesis Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4B with the Poly(A)-binding Protein by Caspase- and Viral Protease-mediated Cleavages*","abstract":"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4B interacts with several components of the initiation pathway and is targeted for cleavage during apoptosis.

Owing to the complex nature of this cellular process, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this pathway remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we use rotavirus (RV) as a model and identify drebrin as a regulatory protein that restricts the cell entry of multiple viruses. We demonstrate that genetic depletion or chemical inhibition of drebrin leads to enhanced RV infection in vitro and increased diarrhea incidence and virus shedding in vivo. Our current study provides insights into endocytosis regulation in general and highlights the potential broad application of blocking drebrin to augment the uptake of viruses and other dynamin-mediated cargo. Despite the wide administration of several effective vaccines, rotavirus (RV) remains the single most important etiological agent of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide, with an annual mortality of over 200,000 people. RV attachment and internalization into target cells is mediated by its outer capsid protein VP4. To better understand the molecular details of RV entry, we performed tandem affinity purification coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to map the host proteins that interact with VP4. We identified an actin-binding protein, drebrin (DBN1), that coprecipitates and colocalizes with VP4 during RV infection. Importantly, blocking DBN1 function by siRNA silencing, CRISPR knockout (KO), or chemical inhibition significantly increased host cell susceptibility to RV infection. Dbn1 KO mice exhibited higher incidence of diarrhea and more viral antigen shedding in their stool samples compared with the wild-type littermates. In addition, we found that uptake of other dynamin-dependent cargos, including transferrin, cholera toxin, and multiple viruses, was also enhanced in DBN1-deficient cells. Inhibition of cortactin or dynamin-2 abrogated the increased virus entry observed in DBN1-deficient cells, suggesting that DBN1 suppresses dynamin-mediated endocytosis via interaction with cortactin. Our study unveiled an unexpected role of DBN1 in restricting the entry of RV and other viruses into host cells and more broadly to function as a crucial negative regulator of diverse dynamin-dependent endocytic pathways.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that genetic depletion or chemical inhibition of drebrin leads to enhanced RV infection in vitro and increased diarrhea incidence and virus shedding in vivo, and an unexpected role of DBN1 is unveiled in restricting the entry of RV and other viruses into host cells and more broadly to function as a crucial negative regulator of diverse dynamin-dependent endocytic pathways."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9399,"details":{"paperId":"10a0debb13845eb3f7c799569b9e5205a4980a9a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2523230276","PubMedCentral":"5032635","DOI":"10.3389/fphar.2016.00334","CorpusId":"7692842","PubMed":"27713700"},"title":"Drug Discovery via Human-Derived Stem Cell Organoids","abstract":"Patient-derived cell lines and animal models have proven invaluable for the understanding of human intestinal diseases and for drug development although both inherently comprise disadvantages and caveats.

Patient-derived stem cell organoids are new and effective models for the development of novel targeted therapies. With the use of intestinal organoids from patients with inherited diseases, the potency and toxicity of drug candidates can be evaluated better.

Antagonists of the Ca2+-activated-Cl− channel, TMEM16A, offers a new mechanism to bronchodilate airways and block the multiple contractiles operating in severe disease. To identify TMEM16A antagonists we screened a library of ~580,000 compounds. The anthelmintics niclosamide, nitazoxanide and related compounds were identified as potent TMEM16A antagonists that blocked airway smooth muscle depolarization and contraction. To evaluate whether TMEM16A antagonists resist use- and inflammatory-desensitization pathways limiting β-agonist action, we tested their efficacy under harsh conditions using maximally contracted airways or airways pretreated with a cytokine cocktail. Stunningly, TMEM16A antagonists fully bronchodilated airways, while the β-agonist isoproterenol showed only partial effects. Thus, antagonists of TMEM16A and repositioning of niclosamide and nitazoxanide represent an important additional treatment for patients with severe asthma and COPD that is poorly controlled with existing therapies. It is of note that drug repurposing has also attracted wide interest in niclosamide and nitazoxanide as a new treatment for cancer and infectious disease.

The discovery that mosquitos were responsible for transmission and that the disease was preventable by vector control, as well as the development of an efficacious vaccine (in the 1930s) have reduced its public health impact. However, underutilization of vaccination and discontinuation of vector control measures have led to yellow fever outbreaks, affecting thousands of people in Africa and South America, and is a continued threat to people who travel to endemic regions without vaccination. An additional concern is that the vaccine has important contraindications, and the currently available doses are insufficient to immunize the populations under risk of contracting yellow fever. Specific antiviral chemotherapy would be an alternative to vaccination, however there is none yet available. Drug repurposing is one strategy that can speed up drug discovery and development and has been underexplored for yellow fever. Methods A high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-yellow fever compounds was developed and used to screen a library of pharmacologically compounds, which includes approved drugs and covers most signalling pathways and all major drug target classes. The same library was screened against cells infected with a serotype 2 of the dengue virus. Results and conclusion From 1280 compounds screened, 88 compounds (6,9% of the library) were found to reduce yellow fever virus (YFV) infection in 50% or more. Interestingly, the number of compounds that presented similar activity against dengue (DENV) infection was considerably lower (18 compounds, 1,4%). Among these, 12 compounds were active against both viruses, highlighting the potential of finding compounds with broad antiviral activity in diversity libraries. The top 27 anti-YFV compounds were selected for further activity determination in dose-response. Five compounds (Gant61, benztropine mesylate, brequinar sodium salt hydrate, PF-429242 dihydrochloride and U-73343) presented selective activity against YFV infection in a human cell line, but only two of them, brequinar and U-73343, were also active against DENV.

ABSTRACT Group A rotaviruses, an important cause of severe diarrhea in children and young animals, initiate infection via interactions of the VP8* domain of the VP4 spike protein with cell surface sialic acids (SAs) or histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Although the bovine G6P[5] WC3 strain is an important animal pathogen and is also used in the bovine-human reassortant RotaTeq vaccine, the receptor(s) for the VP8* domain of WC3 and its reassortant strains have not yet been identified. In the present study, HBGA- and saliva-binding assays showed that both G6P[5] WC3 and mono-reassortant G4P[5] strains recognized the αGal HBGA. The infectivity of both P[5]-bearing strains was significantly reduced in αGal-free MA-104 cells by pretreatment with a broadly specific neuraminidase or by coincubation with the α2,6-linked SA-specific Sambucus nigra lectin, but not by the α2,3-linked specific sialidase or by Maackia amurensis lectin. Free NeuAc and the αGal trisaccharide also prevented the infectivity of both strains. This indicated that both P[5]-bearing strains utilize α2,6-linked SA as a ligand on MA104 cells. However, the two strains replicated in differentiated bovine small intestinal enteroids and in their human counterparts that lack α2,6-linked SA or αGal HBGA, suggesting that additional or alternative receptors such as integrins, hsp70, and tight-junction proteins bound directly to the VP5* domain can be used by the P[5]-bearing strains to initiate the infection of human cells. In addition, these data also suggested that P[5]-bearing strains have potential for cross-species transmission.

Upon recognition, RIG-I triggers a series of signalling molecules such as interferon-β (IFN-β) promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) leading to the expression of type I interferons (IFN-β). Active 25D3 that was generated by PRV-infected IPEC-J2 cells led to an increased expression of toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3), RIG-I, IPS-1, IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes 15 (ISG15) with important innate immune functions. Inhibiting CYP27B1 also failed to increase RIG-I, IPS-1, IFN-β and ISG15 mRNA expression. These observations suggest that 25D3 can directly inhibit PRV in IPEC-J2 cells, which requires this active form of vitamin D. The anti-rotavirus effect of 25D3 is mediated at least in part by RIG-I signalling pathways in IPEC-J2 cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"25D3 can directly inhibit PRV in IPEC-J2 cells, which requires this active form of vitamin D, and observations suggest that the anti-rotavirus effect of 25D3 is mediated at least in part by RIG-I signalling pathways."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2216,"details":{"paperId":"365c820a1cd1630150a49d0103bac8f5ba483c94","externalIds":{"MAG":"2887302674","DOI":"10.1016/j.chom.2018.07.005","CorpusId":"51953868","PubMed":"30092197"},"title":"Effect of Antibiotic-Mediated Microbiome Modulation on Rotavirus Vaccine Immunogenicity: A Human, Randomized-Control Proof-of-Concept Trial.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that microbiota modification alters the immune response to RVV and supports further exploration of microbiome manipulation to improve RVV immunogenicity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9445,"details":{"paperId":"c79777b40eb20a3f9301f244ba0aea140a05eb91","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9495109","DOI":"10.3390/ani12182336","CorpusId":"252174020","PubMed":"36139196"},"title":"Effect of Dietary Lactose Supplementation on Growth Performance and Intestinal Epithelium Functions in Weaned Pigs Challenged by Rotavirus","abstract":"Simple Summary Lactose is a kind of carbohydrate that exists in mammal milk. It has some physiological functions, such as providing energy, regulating gut microbiota, and affecting immunity. Rotavirus (RV) is the main pathogen that induces severe diarrhea in piglets, which impairs their growth and development. In this study, we investigated whether different levels (4% and 6%) of dietary lactose supplementation alleviates RV-induced diarrhea in weaned piglets. The results showed that lactose administration relieved the negative effect of RV on growth, which was derived from the improvement of nutrient utilization, gut barrier function, and immunity. Moreover, supplementing 6% lactose in the diets had a tendency to alleviate diarrhea in RV-infected piglets. Thus, we suggest that the diet of weaned piglets should be supplemented with more than 4% lactose (especially in the early period of weaning) if the cost of feed can be afforded. Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dietary lactose supplementation relieves rotavirus (RV)-induced diarrhea and gut dysfunction. Thirty-six crossbred weaned piglets were randomly allocated into three groups and fed diets containing 0, 4%, and 6% lactose for 20 days. On Day 15, half of the piglets in each group were orally infused with RV. RV infection impaired growth performance; induced severe diarrhea; decreased serum D-xylose concentration and morphology and sIgA level of jejunal mucosa; downregulated MUC1, MUC2, occludin, Bcl-2, IL-4, pBD3, pBD2, and pBD1 mRNA expression of jejunal mucosa and/or mesenteric lymph nodes; upregulated Bax, caspase-3, IL-2, IFN-γ, and IFN-β mRNA expression of jejunal mucosa and/or mesenteric lymph nodes; and damaged microbiota and metabolites of cecal digesta in weaned piglets (p < 0.05). Dietary lactose supplementation improved nutrient digestibility and growth performance and relieved the negative influence of RV challenge on intestinal barrier function, mRNA expression of cytokines, and host defense peptides of jejunal mucosa and/or mesenteric lymph nodes in weaned piglets (p < 0.05).

However, little is known about how sanitizer efficacy varies with respect to the chemical surface properties of produce. To answer this question, the disinfection efficacies of an oxidant-based sanitizer and a new surfactant-based sanitizer for porcine rotavirus (PRV) strain OSU were examined. PRV was attached to the leaf surfaces of two kale cultivars with high epicuticular wax contents and one cultivar of endive with a low epicuticular wax content and then treated with each sanitizer. The efficacy of the oxidant-based sanitizer correlated with leaf wax content as evidenced by the 1-log10 PRV disinfection on endive surfaces (low wax content) and 3-log10 disinfection of the cultivars with higher wax contents. In contrast, the surfactant-based sanitizer showed similar PRV disinfection efficacies (up to 3 log10) that were independent of leaf wax content. A statistical difference was observed with the disinfection efficacies of the oxidant-based sanitizer for suspended and attached PRV, while the surfactant-based sanitizer showed similar PRV disinfection efficacies. Significant reductions in the entry and replication of PRV were observed after treatment with either disinfectant. Moreover, the oxidant-based-sanitizer-treated PRV showed sialic acid-specific binding to the host cells, whereas the surfactant-based sanitizer increased the nonspecific binding of PRV to the host cells. These findings suggest that the surface properties of fresh produce may affect the efficacy of virus disinfection, implying that food sanitizers should be carefully selected for the different surface characteristics of fresh produce. IMPORTANCE Food sanitizer efficacies are affected by the surface properties of vegetables. This study evaluated the disinfection efficacies of two food sanitizers, an oxidant-based sanitizer and a surfactant-based sanitizer, on porcine rotavirus strain OSU adhering to the leaf epicuticular surfaces of high- and low-wax-content cultivars. The disinfection efficacy of the oxidant-based sanitizer was affected by the surface properties of the vegetables, while the surfactant-based sanitizer was effective for both high- and low-wax leafy vegetable cultivars.

A total of 40 rats were randomly divided into normal group, LPS group, LPS + Lianshu group, LPS + berberine group (n = 10 in each group). Their intestinal mucosal barrier and frequency of diarrhea were observed. Levels of glucose, serum Na(+), K(+), Cl(-) and hematocrit, plasma nitrogen monoxide (NO), diamine oxidase (DAO), and D (-)-lactate were measured. The number of IgA+ plasma cells in small intestine was detected and SIgA levels in the intestinal fluid were measured. The antipyretic activity of Lianshu preparation in rats was evaluated using Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia (10 mL/kg of 20% aqueous suspension). Acetaminophen (250 mg/kg, intragastric administration, bid) was used as a standard drug for comparison. Temperature was recorded 1 h before and 6 h after Brewer's yeast injection. Finally, small intestinal transmission in mice treated with Lianshu was detected after intraperitoneal injection of methyl prostigmin (2 mg/kg). Atropine (10 g/kg) was used as a control.

Because of concerns about variation in rotavirus vaccine efficacy by socioeconomic status, we compared reductions in diarrhea mortality in the lesser developed southern region versus the more developed northern and central regions of Mexico. METHODS: We obtained data from national vital statistics on diarrhea deaths among children aged <5 years from 2002 through 2011. We compared region-specific diarrhea mortality before (2003–2006) and after (2009–2011) vaccine introduction. Regional vaccine coverage was estimated from administrative data, and socioeconomic status was assessed by using the Human Development Index. RESULTS: In northern, central, and southern Mexico, the 2007 Human Development Index was 0.84, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively, and by 2010 an estimated 99%, 84%, and 89% of children aged <12 months had completed rotavirus vaccination. Diarrhea mortality among children <5 years old declined from 8.3, 17.9, and 28.5 deaths per 100 000 children during 2003–2006 to 4.5, 8.1, and 16.2 in 2009–2011 in northern, central, and southern Mexico, respectively, corresponding to rate reductions of 45%, 55%, and 43%. No significant differences were observed in rate reductions between regions (P > .8). CONCLUSIONS: After introduction of rotavirus vaccination, marked and sustained declines in diarrhea deaths were seen among children in all regions of Mexico, including in the least developed southern region with the highest baseline diarrhea mortality.

The maturation process is unique not only because it involves translocation of subviral particles across the ER membrane, but also because mature virus is thought to be retained in the ER until cell lysis. Brefeldin A (BFA) is a compound that blocks protein export from the ER to the Golgi complex and causes disruption of the Golgi complex with relocation of resident Golgi proteins to the ER. We found that BFA had a pronounced effect on rotavirus assembly and oligosaccharide processing. Single-step growth experiments demonstrated that BFA reduced infectious progeny rotavirus yield by 99.9%. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies showed that all examined VP4, VP6, VP7, and NS28 epitopes remained unaffected by BFA. A novel observation from pulse-chase experiments was that BFA-treatment rapidly increased the molecular weight of the ER-associated VP7 followed by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) resistance. A novel observation was also that the trans-ER NS28 protein remained endo H sensitive through the course of BFA-treatment, but that the molecular weight varied during chase.

Lower vaccine effectiveness has however been noted in low-middle income countries, but little is known about the role of maternal components found in breast milk. This study assessed the effect of lactoferrin, lactadherin, and tenascin-c on rotavirus vaccine seroconversion. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 128 infants who had been fully immunized with Rotarix™. Serum samples were collected from the infant at baseline and one month after second rotavirus vaccine dose. Breast milk samples were collected from mothers at baseline. Standard ELISA was used to determine titres of rotavirus-specific immunologlobulin G and A in breast milk and serum as well as concentrations of lactoferrin, lactadherin, and tenascin-c. Poisson regression model with robust standard error was used to estimate the effect of breast milk components on seroconversion. The components were modelled on log base 2 so that the effect would be interpreted as a doubling of the concentration. Results In a multivariable analysis adjusting for maternal age, maternal HIV status, seropositivity at baseline, sex, age of child at vaccination as well as breast milk IgA and IgG, we found evidence of independent effect of LA (Adjusted IRR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.91–0.99; P = 0.019) on seroconversion while there was no evidence for TNC (Adjusted IRR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.85–1.17; P = 0.967) and LF (Adjusted RR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.96–1.05); P = 0.802).

To determine the effectiveness of tormentil root extract (TRE) for treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in children. Background. Rotavirus, one of the most widely spread pathogens of acute, dehydrating diarrhea in children, is estimated to cause >800 000 annual deaths of young children in developing countries. Currently no rotavirus vaccine is available. Management involves rehydration therapy. Available antiperistaltic or antisecretory drugs to reduce the severity of diarrhea can cause serious side effects in children. Methods. A randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Children’s Hospital for Infectious Diseases #3, St. Petersburg, Russia in 40 children ranging in age from 3 months to 7 years with rotavirus diarrhea. We constructed 2 groups for comparison: a treatment group that consisted of 20 children treated with tormentil root extract; and a control group of 20 children who received a placebo. All patients received 3 drops of tormentil root extract or placebo per year of life, three times daily until discontinuation of diarrhea, or a maximum of 5 days. An objective method was used to evaluate diarrhea, and physical examination was used to assess degree of dehydration in children. Results. The duration of diarrhea in the tormentil root extract treatment group was 3 days, compared with 5 days in the control group (P < 0.0001). In the treatment group 8 of 20 (40%) children were diarrhea-free 48 h after admission to the hospital, compared with 1 of 20 (5%) in the control group (P < 0.0001). Subjects in the treatment group received smaller volumes of parenteral fluids than subjects in the control group. Conclusions.

[1] describe inhibition of both rotavirus replication and nonstructural protein NSP4 glycosylation as well as decrease in viral protein VP4 and VP7 levels due to prostaglandin A1 (PGA1). Ultrastructural analysis of SA11 rotavirus morphogenesis showed that despite budding of particles into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), virus maturation was impaired in PGA1-treated cells, with most of the virus particles remaining in “enveloped” particles. Similar morphologic observations have been shown for cells treated with tunicamycin (N-linked glycosylation inhibitor), although tunicamycin inhibits glycosylation of both VP7 and NSP4 [2–5]. Rotaviruses have a unique morphogenesis in which particles obtain a transient membrane envelope that is formed by the budding of subvirus particles into the ER [5]. This transient membrane is lost, and the mature, double-shelled virus particles acquire the two outer capsid proteins (VP4 and VP7) in the ER lumen. The authors considered that in PGA1-treated cells, virus maturation from enveloped particles to double-shelled particles was impaired. However, another interpretation is possible. Recently, we proposed a novel pathway of virus maturation by an exocytosis-like process, probably by a fusion-like mechanism, so that during double-shelled particle assembly, subvirus particles (possibly single-shelled particles) acquire the outer capsid protein during their transport across the ER membrane [6, 7]. The envelope that is formed by the budding process subsequently swells and is ruptured, and single-shelled particles are released later during cytolysis. Thus the budding process may simply serve as a vehicle to transport single-shelled particles from the cytoplasm to the ER lumen. On the basis of our observations and the finding for tunicamycin-treated cells [2–5], it is conceivable that glycosylation of NSP4 is indispensable for double-shelled particle assembly and regulation of transport of single-shelled particles through the ER membrane [6, 7]. Therefore, inhibition of NSP4 glycosylation in PGA1-treated cells, as in the case with tunicamycin, could be responsible for not only the increase in enveloped particles through the budding process, but also the reduction in double-shelled particles through the exocytosis-like process. We agree with the proposal of Superti et al. [1] that PGA1 inhibits rotavirus replication and offers new perspectives in the search for effective therapeutic agents for rotavirus gastroenteritis.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is agreed that PGA1 inhibits rotavirus replication and offers new perspectives in the search for effective therapeutic agents for rotaviruses and glycosylation of NSP4 is indispensable for double- shelled particle assembly and regulation of transport of single-shelled particles through the ER membrane."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":440,"details":{"paperId":"4e4eed9c6843cc2df01a76cb2885c8124f39139e","externalIds":{"MAG":"3177191045","DOI":"10.1002/rmv.2259","CorpusId":"237882803"},"title":"Effect of rotavirus genetic diversity on vaccine impact","abstract":"Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are the leading cause of gastroenteritis, causing 0.2 million deaths and several million hospitalisations globally each year.

The results obtained were as follows; at pH 6.6, distribution of cPGN particle size did not show any difference between physical and enzymatic treatment, while average particle size of physical and enzymatic treatment showed 1.26 ′ 0.17 and 1.35′0.21, respectively. And then, no differences in the distribution of particle size of bifidobacterial cPGN depending upon Bifidobacterium strains tested were shown. Also, increasing effect of bifidobacterial adherence to Caco-2 cell was shown only to cPGN with enzymatic treatment. As bifidobacterial cPGN concentration increased, adherence ability of bifidobacteria to Caco-2 cell also increased. Nevertheless, no promoting effect was shown to bifidobacteria which possessed low adherence ability, and adherence of E. coli 0157:H7 to Caco-2 cell remained unchanged. Subsequently, it was shown that promoting effect of bifidobacterial cPGN on adherence of bifidobacteria to Caco-2 cell reduced adherence percentage of E. coli O157:H7 relatively. In order to investigate the inhibitory effects of bifidobacteria-derived materials on rotavirus infection, effect of bifidobacterial cPGN was assessed by CPE observation and AEC staining method using MA-104 cell. Accordingly, dead cell mass (DCM) and cPGN had positive effectiveness on inhibition of rotavirus infection. Considering adherence ability of Bifidobacterium infantis MAEIL-K9 to MA-104 cell and percentage of rotavirus infection, the higher adherence ability increased, the lower rotavirus infection decreased. Additionally, when Bif. infantis MAEIL-K9 and cPGN were reacted with MA-104 cell simultaneously, adherence percentage of Bif. infantis MAEIL-K9 increased with cPGN added, followed inhibitory effect of bifidobacteria on rotavirus infection also increased. Consequently, even though cPGN derived from bifidobacteria did not show inhibitory effect on E. coli O157:H7, it was proven that adherence of E. coli O157:H7 to Caco-2 cell was relatively inhibited by competition against adherence site, according to increment of adherence percentage of bifidobacteria. Moreover, bifidobacteria-derived cPGN and adherence percentage of bifidobacteria appeared to be protective against human and bovine rotavirus infection. In conclusion, relying upon increment of bifidobacterial viable cell counts, its adherence ability, and adherence-promoting materials to Caco-2 cell, inhibitory effects of bifidobacteria on E. coli O157:H7 and rotavirus infection seemed to be much higher.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8115,"details":{"paperId":"8990837ccac57b0b808ed3d39b928eb763b2baa1","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"5154029","MAG":"2567377793","DOI":"10.1186/s13099-016-0148-7","CorpusId":"17352029","PubMed":"27999620"},"title":"Effects of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and Ciprofloxacin on small intestinal epithelial cell mRNA expression in the neonatal piglet model of human rotavirus infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["CaseReport"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"EcN protects the intestinal epithelium from damage by increasing the gene expression of enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells, maintaining the absorptive function and, consequently, decreasing the severity of diarrhea in HRV infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":10165,"details":{"paperId":"246fbf93394b5d2cf7a76cb2efcef0da24720b9a","externalIds":{"MAG":"811417773","DOI":"10.5187/JAST.2002.44.6.809","CorpusId":"82086599"},"title":"Effects of Heat Treatment of Chitooligosaccharide and Water-Soluble Chitosan on the Changes in Oligosaccharide Content and Anti-Rotaviral Activity","abstract":"Chitosan is the deacetylated product of chitin.

Here, we describe the use of simple viscogens, glycerol and sucrose, to examine their effects on RNA transcription inside MRV core particles. Transcription inside MRV cores was strongly inhibited by these agents and to a greater extent than either predicted by theory or exhibited by a nonencapsidated transcriptase, suggesting that RNA transcription inside MRV cores is unusually sensitive to viscogen effects. The elongation phase of transcription was found to be a primary target of this inhibition. Similar results were obtained with particles of a second dsRNA virus, rhesus rotavirus, from a divergent taxonomic subfamily. Polymeric viscogens such as polyethylene glycol also inhibited RNA transcription inside MRV cores, but in a size-limited manner, suggesting that diffusion through channels in the MRV core is required for their activity. Modeling of the data suggested that the inherent intracapsid viscosity of both reo- and rotavirus is indeed high, two to three times the viscosity of water.

So far, we have analyzed 10 different housekeeping genes belonging to different functional and abundance classes in various tissues and cells. We clearly observed that no gene is really constantly expressed and multiple housekeeping genes are required for an accurate normalization (Vandesompele et al., submitted for publication). One-step RT-PCR reactions are often preferred over two-step reactions, because of a presumed minimization of experimental variation, as all enzymatic steps occur in the same tube under controlled thermocycler conditions. To address the issue of reproducibility, we determined the interassay variation of our established two-step RT-PCR protocol. We have therefore subjected nine different RNA samples to two parallel rounds of DNase treatment and cDNA synthesis and quantified the relative expression levels of each of four housekeeping genes (HMBS, UBC, ACTB, and HPRT1) in all samples using the comparative Ct method. The two-step protocol is highly reproducible with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.974 to 0.988 between the expression levels of the two parallel series of cDNA samples for the four tested genes, of which one is shown in Fig. 3. The interassay variation was calculated as the median coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the arithmetic mean) for the paired relative quantities obtained in the two parallel series for the four genes and amount to 7.7%. This figure is only slightly higher than the observed median intraassay variation of 5.8% (reflecting the variation between duplicated reactions in the same PCR run; based on 25 different genes tested on 30 samples, data not shown) and demonstrates the reproducibility of the two-step approach. To summarize, SYBR green I is the detection format of choice for accurate and reproducible real-time transcript abundance measurements of a large series of genes.

In this study, LDB and antibiotic diets were fed to the LDB and antibiotic groups of female growing-finishing pigs, respectively. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to identify different microbiota. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics approaches were used to identify different metabolites. The co-occurrence network of the fecal microbiota and metabolite was analyzed. The results contain information on pig growth performance, microbiota data, metabolite data and co-occurrence networks, supporting the possibility of LDB as an antibiotics replacement in pig production. Abstract Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LDB) is an approved feed additive on the Chinese ‘Approved Feed Additives’ list. However, the possibility of LDB as an antibiotic replacement remains unclear. Particularly, the effect of LDB on microbiota and metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) requires further explanation. This study aimed to identify the microbiota and metabolites present in fecal samples and investigate the relationship between the microbiota and metabolites to evaluate the potential of LDB as an antibiotic replacement in pig production. A total of 42 female growing-finishing pigs were randomly allocated into the antibiotic group (basal diet + 75 mg/kg aureomycin) and LDB (basal diet + 3.0 × 109 cfu/kg LDB) groups. Fecal samples were collected on days 0 and 30. Growth performance was recorded and assessed. 16S rRNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics approaches were used to analyze the differences in microbiota and metabolites. Associations between the differences were calculated using Spearman correlations with the Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment. The LDB diet had no adverse effect on feed efficiency but slightly enhanced the average daily weight gain and average daily feed intake (p > 0.05). The diet supplemented with LDB increased Lactobacillus abundance and decreased that of Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group spp. Dietary-supplemented LDB enhanced the concentrations of pyridoxine, tyramine, D-(+)-pyroglutamic acid, hypoxanthine, putrescine and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid and decreased the lithocholic acid concentration. The Lactobacillus networks (Lactobacillus, Peptococcus, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-004, Escherichia-Shigella, acetophenone, tyramine, putrescine, N-methylisopelletierine, N1-acetylspermine) and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group networks (Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Treponema_2, monolaurin, penciclovir, N-(5-acetamidopentyl)acetamide, glycerol 3-phosphate) were the most important in the LDB effect on pig GIT health in our study. These findings indicate that LDB may regulate GIT function through the Lactobacillus and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group networks.

At the age of 5 and 6 d the pups received oral rotavirus (RV) SA-11 strain. The pups were sacrificed at the age of 7 or 8 d by decapitation.

Infection is inhibited by the α2β1 ligand Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala (DGEA) and the αxβ2 ligand Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP), and virus-α2β1 binding is increased by α2β1 activation. In this study, we analyzed the effects of monomers and polymers containing DGEA-, GPRP-, and DGEA-related peptides on rotavirus binding and infection in intestinal (Caco-2) and kidney (MA104) cells and virus binding to recombinant α2β1. Blockade of rotavirus-cell binding and infection by peptides and anti-α2 antibody showed that Caco-2 cell entry is dependent on virus binding to α2β1 and interaction with αxβ2. At up to 0.5 mM, monomeric DGEA and DGAA inhibited binding to α2β1 and infection. At higher concentrations, DGEA and DGAA showed a reduced ability to inhibit virus-cell binding and infection that depended on virus binding to α2β1 but occurred without alteration in cell surface expression of α2, β2, or αvβ3 integrin. This loss of DGEA activity was abolished by genistein treatment and so was dependent on tyrosine kinase signaling. It is proposed that this signaling activated existing cell surface α2β1 to increase virus-cell attachment and entry. Polymeric peptides containing DGEA and GPRP or GPRP only were inhibitory to SA11 infection at approximately 10-fold lower concentrations than peptide monomers. As polymerization can improve peptide inhibition of virus-receptor interactions, this approach could be useful in the development of inhibitors of receptor recognition by other viruses.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Blockade of rotavirus-cell binding and infection by peptides and anti-α2 antibody showed that Caco-2 cell entry is dependent on virus binding to α2β1 and interaction with αxβ2."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8891,"details":{"paperId":"3b9761b02f23f307ba3dee1d85964df54d8f0ba4","externalIds":{"MAG":"2788647564","DOI":"10.21767/2573-0282.100060","CorpusId":"44080026"},"title":"Efficacy and Effectiveness of Rotavirus Vaccine on Incidence of Diarrhoea among Children: A Meta-analysis","abstract":"Background: Introduction of rotavirus vaccines has resulted in a decrease in rotavirus related mortality and morbidity.

We evaluated the efficacy of a gentamicin-intercalated smectite hybrid (S-GM)-based treatment, and analyzed fecal microbiome composition in H. pylori-infected mice. Methodology To evaluate anti-H. pylori efficacy, mice were divided into eight groups, and H. pylori eradication was assessed by Campylobacter-like organism (CLO) test and PCR assay of H. pylori in gastric mucosa. One week after H. pylori eradication, proinflammatory cytokine levels and atrophic changes in gastric mucosa were examined. Stool specimens were collected and analyzed for microbiome changes. The S-GM-based triple regimen decreased bacterial burden in vivo, compared with that in untreated mice or mice treated with other regimens. The therapeutic reactions in the CLO test from gastric mucosa were both 90% in standard triple therapy and S-GM therapy group, respectively. Those of H. pylori PCR in mouse gastric mucosa were significantly lower in standard triple therapy and S-GM therapy groups than in non-treatment group. Toxicity test results showed that S-GM therapy reduced IL-8 level and atrophic changes in gastric mucosa. Stool microbiome analysis revealed that compared with mice treated with the standard triple therapy, mice treated with the S-GM therapy showed microbiome diversity and abundant microorganisms at the phylum level. Conclusion Our results suggested that S-GM is a promising and effective therapeutic agent against H. pylori infection. Author summary The eradication rate on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) showed decreasing trend due to antibiotic resistance, especially clarithromycin. Therefore, we made a smectite hybrid as a drug delivery system using aminoglycosides antibiotic-gentamicin, and applied it to the mouse stomach wall to confirm the localized therapeutic effect, and set the different treatment duration to verify the effect. As a result, it was confirmed that the therapeutic efficacy of gentamicin (GM)-intercalated smectite hybrid (S-GM) was not inferior to the existing standard triple therapy, based on amoxicillin and clarithromycin, and preserved the diversity of gut microbiome composition.

METHODS We conducted a randomized, placebo‐controlled trial in Niger to evaluate the efficacy of a live, oral bovine rotavirus pentavalent vaccine (BRV‐PV, Serum Institute of India) to prevent severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy infants received three doses of the vaccine or placebo at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Episodes of gastroenteritis were assessed through active and passive surveillance and were graded on the basis of the score on the Vesikari scale (which ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating more severe disease). The primary end point was the efficacy of three doses of vaccine as compared with placebo against a first episode of laboratory‐confirmed severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (Vesikari score, ≥11) beginning 28 days after dose 3. RESULTS Among the 3508 infants who were included in the per‐protocol efficacy analysis, there were 31 cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in the vaccine group and 87 cases in the placebo group (2.14 and 6.44 cases per 100 person‐years, respectively), for a vaccine efficacy of 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.9 to 77.9). Similar efficacy was seen in the intention‐to‐treat analyses, which showed a vaccine efficacy of 69.1% (95% CI, 55.0 to 78.7).

Because this approach has shown limited efficacy, a modified Jennerian approach was developed with the goal of achieving broader antigenic coverage.

The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms of action underlying the anti-emetic effect of electroacupuncture (EA). Design Forty-eight rats received saline (n=12) or 6 mg/kg cisplatin (n=36) to establish a chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting model. EA was performed at CV12 (n=12), bilateral PC6 (n=12), or sham points (n=12) 3 days before and 1–2 days after cisplatin administration (4–5 times in total), at 0.5–1 mA intensity and 2/15 Hz frequency for 10 min. Kaolin intake, food intake and bodyweight change were evaluated as markers of nausea and vomiting severity. Concentrations of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the duodenum and c-Fos expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were measured using high performance liquid chromatography and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results Cisplatin administration led to increased kaolin intake and reduced food intake and bodyweight over the following 2 days. EA at CV12 significantly reversed the cisplatin-induced change in kaolin intake (on days 1 and 2) and food intake and bodyweight (on day 1). EA at CV12 also attenuated the cisplatin-induced increase in 5-HT in the duodenum and suppressed c-Fos expression in the NTS. EA at PC6 influenced kaolin intake (on day 1 only) and c-Fos expression, but had no statistically significant effect on food intake, bodyweight or 5-HT expression.

Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis among infants, children, and at-risk adults. Infections are more severe in developing countries where access to health care, clean food, and water is limited. Passive immunization using orally administered egg yolk antibodies (chicken IgY) is proven for prophylaxis and therapy of viral diarrhea, owing to the stability of avian IgY in the harsh gut environment. Since preservation of viral antigenicity is critical for successful antibody production, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the effective use of electron beam irradiation as a method of pathogen inactivation to produce rotavirus-specific neutralizing egg yolk antibodies. White leghorn hens were immunized with the eBeam-inactivated viruses every 2 weeks until serum antibody titers peaked. The relative antigenicity of eBeam-inactivated Wa G1P[8] human rotavirus (HRV) was compared to live virus, thermally, and chemically inactivated virus preparations. Using a sandwich ELISA (with antibodies against recombinant VP8 for capture and detection of HRV), the live virus was as expected, most immunoreactive. The eBeam-inactivated HRV’s antigenicity was better preserved when compared to thermally and chemically inactivated viruses. Additionally, both egg yolk antibodies and serum-derived IgY were effective at neutralizing HRV in vitro.

The recent development of a reverse genetics system for RVs has delivered the possibility of engineering chimeric viruses expressing heterologous peptides from other virus species to generate polyvalent vaccines. We tested the feasibility of this using two approaches. Firstly, we inserted short SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides into the hypervariable region of the simian SA11 RV strain viral protein (VP) 4. Secondly, we fused the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or the shorter receptor binding motif (RBM) nested within the RBD, to the C-terminus of non-structural protein (NSP) 3 of the bovine RF strain RV, with or without an intervening T2A peptide. Mutating the hypervariable region of SA11 VP4 impeded viral replication, and for these mutants no cross-reactivity with spike antibodies was detected. To rescue NSP3 mutants, we established a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for the bovine RF strain. Except for the RBD mutant, all NSP3 mutants delivered endpoint titres and replication kinetics comparable to that of the WT virus. In ELISAs, cell lysates of an NSP3 mutant expressing the RBD peptide showed cross reactivity with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody. 3D bovine gut enteroids were susceptible to infection by all NSP3 mutants but only RBM mutant showed cross reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody. The tolerability of large peptide insertions in the NSP3 segment highlights the potential for this approach in the development of vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously. IMPORTANCE We explored the use of rotaviruses (RVs) to express heterologous peptides, using SARS-CoV-2 as an exemplar. Small SARS-CoV-2 peptide insertion (<34 amino acids) into the hypervariable region of the viral protein 4 (VP4) of RV SA11 strain resulted in reduced viral titre and replication, thus limiting its use as a potential vaccine expression platform. To test RF strain for its tolerance for peptide insertions, we constructed a reverse genetics system. NSP3 was C-terminally tagged with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides of up to 193 amino acids. With a T2A-separated 193 amino acid tag on NSP3, there was little effect on the viral rescue efficiency, titre and replication. Tagged NSP3 elicited cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in ELISA. This is the first report describing epitope tagging of VP4, and of a reverse genetics system for the RF strain. We highlight the potential for development of RV vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This is the first report describing epitope tagging of VP4, and of a reverse genetics system for the RF strain, and the tolerability of large peptide insertions in the NSP3 segment highlights the potential for this approach in the development of vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8092,"details":{"paperId":"70f0a1682e5151ddd51361bdad30ad9144b73bb3","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1186/s12985-015-0436-8","CorpusId":"255958307"},"title":"Engineering and expression of a human rotavirus candidate vaccine in Nicotiana benthamiana","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that theRotavirus proteins produced in N. benthamiana are candidates for a subunit vaccine specifically for the G9P[6] rotavirus strain, which could be more effective in developing countries, thereby possibly providing a higher overall efficacy for the existing vaccines."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2949,"details":{"paperId":"0b708c01611b327736d8ea686d9802e02f75fb99","externalIds":{"MAG":"2922368729","DOI":"10.1016/j.phytochem.2019.03.006","CorpusId":"81975333","PubMed":"30877900"},"title":"Engineering partial resistance to cucumber mosaic virus in tobacco using intrabodies specific for the viral polymerase.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work describes for the first time the use of intrabodies against the RdRp of CMV to obtain plants that reduce infection of a pandemic virus, showing that the selected scFvs can modulate virus infection and induce premature recovery in tobacco plants."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1306,"details":{"paperId":"b0aef79830a053e4581a34281a4f4bfc893be7cf","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s10719-012-9404-3","CorpusId":"254501053"},"title":"Enhanced N-glycosylation site exploitation of sialoglycopeptides by peptide IPG-IEF assisted TiO2 chromatography","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This paper developed a new strategy, peptide immobilized pH gradient isoelectric focusing (IPG-IEF) assisted TiO2 chromatography (PIAT), for the highly efficient enrichment of sialoglycopeptides, and represents one of the most comprehensive sialglycoproteomic analyses in general and exhibits the largest database of sIALoglycoproteome in rat liver currently."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2533,"details":{"paperId":"b79c0c7bbfbc5f0a820a7933eb99b2fd9ae50e12","externalIds":{"MAG":"2019629829","DOI":"10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.02.012","CorpusId":"5251713","PubMed":"25668771"},"title":"Enhanced glutathione PEGylated liposomal brain delivery of an anti-amyloid single domain antibody fragment in a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Evidence is provided that GSH-PEG liposomes may be suitable for specific delivery of single domain antibody fragments over the BBB into the brain."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4442,"details":{"paperId":"2548dd52d6179d0b757c184bf041eabd4ce64b57","externalIds":{"MAG":"2315283185","DOI":"10.1038/sj.gt.3300748","CorpusId":"7864227","PubMed":"9930347"},"title":"Enhancement by polylysine of transient, but not stable, expression of genes carried into cells by polyoma VP1 pseudocapsids","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The presence of pseudocapsids, in complexes with DNA with or without polylysine, allowed for stable and persistent gene expression, and was found to increase the efficiency of short-term expression both in in vitro and in vivo experiments."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7311,"details":{"paperId":"5462a62cb6dc4ed586c9d3806405038c355ead95","externalIds":{"MAG":"1585763419","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.72.4.3387-3389.1998","CorpusId":"32904362","PubMed":"9525667"},"title":"Enhancement of Aquareovirus Infectivity by Treatment with Proteases: Mechanism of Action","abstract":"ABSTRACT The effects of protease digestion on the polypeptide composition and on the infectivity of striped bass virus, an aquareovirus, were examined.

Results: Cells carrying mutations of the α1 subunit with enhanced collagen binding show increased ERK activation and increased collagen down-regulation. Conclusion: Enhancing the affinity of the α1 subunit to collagen potentiates integrin α1β1-mediated outside-in signaling. Significance: These findings have major implications for pathological conditions such as fibrotic diseases. Integrin α1β1 binding to collagen IV, which is mediated by the α1-inserted (I) domain, down-regulates collagen synthesis. When unligated, a salt bridge between Arg287 and Glu317 is thought to keep this domain in a low affinity conformation. Ligand binding opens the salt bridge leading to a high-affinity conformation. How modulating integrin α1β1 affinity alters collagen homeostasis is unknown. To address this question, we utilized a thermolysin-derived product of the α1α2α1 network of collagen IV (α1α2α1(IV) truncated protomer) that selectively binds integrin α1β1. We show that an E317A substitution enhanced binding to the truncated protomer, consistent with a previous finding that this substitution eliminates the salt bridge. Surprisingly, we show that an R287A substitution did not alter binding, whereas R287E/E317R substitutions enhanced binding to the truncated protomer. NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling suggested that eliminating the Glu317 negative charge is sufficient to induce a conformational change toward the open state. Thus, the role played by Glu317 is largely independent of the salt bridge. We further show that cells expressing E317A or R287E/E317R substitutions have enhanced down-regulation of collagen IV synthesis, which is mediated by the ERK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that modulating the affinity of the extracellular α1 I domain to collagen IV enhances outside-in signaling by potentiating ERK activation and enhancing the down-regulation of collagen synthesis.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Modulating the affinity of the extracellular α1 I domain to collagen IV enhances outside-in signaling by potentiating ERK activation and enhancing the down-regulation of collagen synthesis."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9933,"details":{"paperId":"cd55c4a6dd39804dd0da91c1ed51f9e7077e2860","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3573750","MAG":"2041465954","DOI":"10.3892/ijmm.2012.1044","CorpusId":"13642808","PubMed":"22751701"},"title":"Enhancing apoptotic cell clearance mitigates bacterial translocation and promotes tissue repair after gut ischemia-reperfusion injury","abstract":"A key aspect of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the increased occurrence of apoptotic cell death in the gut. Insufficient clearance of apoptotic cells leads to increased inflammation and impaired tissue repair. Our recent studies have shown that administration of milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor 8 (MFG-E8), a crucial molecule for apoptotic cell clearance, reduces apoptosis and inflammation under various disease conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MFG-E8 reduces bacterial translocation and promotes tissue repair in a mouse model of gut I/R. Gut ischemia was induced by placing a microvascular clip across the superior mesenteric artery for 90 min in male adult mice. After removing the clip, recombinant murine MFG-E8 (rmMFG-E8) (0.4 μg/20 g BW) or normal saline (Vehicle) was intraperitoneally injected. At 4 h after reperfusion, apoptosis in the gut was measured by TUNEL staining. The mesenteric lymph node (MLN) complex was homogenized and plated on chocolate agar plates for bacterial culture. Neutrophil infiltration was assessed by examining myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the gut. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the gut, an indicator of tissue repair, were measured by western blotting. Out results showed that TUNEL-positive staining in the gut increased significantly in gut I/R vehicle-treated mice. Treatment with rmMFG-E8 markedly suppressed the number of apoptotic cells. Bacterial translocation to the MLN was minimal in sham mice, but was extensive in gut I/R vehicle-treated mice. rmMFG-E8 treatment significantly reduced bacterial translocation to the MLN. Similarly, gut I/R induced a significant increase in intestinal MPO activities in vehicle-treated mice. rmMFG-E8 treatment markedly reduced the increase in intestinal MPO activities after gut I/R. Intestinal levels of VEGF decreased significantly at 4 h after gut I/R. rmMFG-E8 treatment significantly increased intestinal VEGF levels. Thus, enhancing apoptotic cell clearance by rmMFG-E8 mitigates bacterial translocation, inhibits neutrophil infiltration and promotes tissue repair after gut I/R. Enhancing apoptotic cell clearance can be a novel concept in the treatment of gut I/R injury.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Enhancing apoptotic cell clearance by rmMFG-E8 mitigates bacterial translocation, inhibits neutrophil infiltration and promotes tissue repair after gut I/R injury."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2228,"details":{"paperId":"e246ea36a9d96f2468e51349b48acb7859e01f19","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.chom.2021.12.002","CorpusId":"245385358","PubMed":"34932985"},"title":"Enteric virome negatively affects seroconversion following oral rotavirus vaccination in a longitudinally sampled cohort of Ghanaian infants.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Analysis of the enteric microbiota in a longitudinal cohort of 122 Ghanaian infants evaluated over the course of 3 Rotarix vaccinations suggests that virome-RVV interference is an underappreciated cause of poor vaccine performance in LMICs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6020,"details":{"paperId":"70b6da726328a3e5f8e9b58cc3c817e78c87ec17","externalIds":{"MAG":"3094304613","DOI":"10.1101/2020.10.20.347286","CorpusId":"225056965"},"title":"Enteric viruses evoke broad host immune responses resembling bacterial microbiome","abstract":"Contributions of the viral component of the microbiome, the virome, to the development of innate and adaptive immunity are largely unknown.

Focusing on SFB-driven responses, we describe the expression pattern of MHCII and the associated antigen processing machinery among IEC subpopulations along with the cellular network that regulates MHCII induction. Furthermore, we show that SFB induce the accumulation of SFB-specific intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) that originate from conventional CD4+ T-cells.

The use of antibiotics exacerbates intestinal microbial imbalance and results in the persistence of RV-induced diarrhea. ABSTRACT Human rotavirus (HRV) infection is a major cause of gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Broad-spectrum antibiotic-induced intestinal microbial imbalance and the ensuing immune-metabolic dysregulation contribute to the persistence of HRV diarrhea. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a Gram-negative probiotic, was shown to be a potent immunostimulant and alleviated HRV-induced diarrhea in monocolonized gnotobiotic (Gn) piglets. Our goal was to determine how EcN modulates immune responses in ciprofloxacin (Cipro)-treated Gn piglets colonized with a defined commensal microbiota (DM) and challenged with virulent HRV (VirHRV). Cipro given in therapeutic doses for a short term reduced serum and intestinal total and HRV-specific antibody titers, while EcN treatment alleviated this effect. Similarly, EcN treatment increased the numbers of total immunoglobulin-secreting cells, HRV-specific antibody-secreting cells, activated antibody-forming cells, resting/memory antibody-forming B cells, and naive antibody-forming B cells in systemic and/or intestinal tissues. Decreased levels of proinflammatory but increased levels of immunoregulatory cytokines and increased frequencies of Toll-like receptor-expressing cells were evident in the EcN-treated VirHRV-challenged group. Moreover, EcN treatment increased the frequencies of T helper and T cytotoxic cells in systemic and/or intestinal tissues pre-VirHRV challenge and the frequencies of T helper cells, T cytotoxic cells, effector T cells, and T regulatory cells in systemic and/or intestinal tissues postchallenge. Moreover, EcN treatment increased the frequencies of systemic and mucosal conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, respectively, and the frequencies of systemic natural killer cells. Our findings demonstrated that Cipro use altered immune responses of DM-colonized neonatal Gn pigs, while EcN supplementation rescued these immune parameters partially or completely. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus (RV) is a primary cause of malabsorptive diarrhea in children and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. The use of antibiotics exacerbates intestinal microbial imbalance and results in the persistence of RV-induced diarrhea. Probiotics are now being used to treat enteric infections and ulcerative colitis. We showed previously that probiotics partially protected gnotobiotic (Gn) piglets against human RV (HRV) infection and decreased the severity of diarrhea by modulating immune responses. However, the interactions between antibiotic and probiotic treatments and HRV infection in the context of an established gut microbiota are poorly understood. In this study, we developed a Gn pig model to study antibiotic-probiotic-HRV interactions in the context of a defined commensal microbiota (DM) that mimics aspects of the infant gut microbiota. Our results provide valuable information that will contribute to the treatment of antibiotic- and/or HRV-induced diarrhea and may be applicable to other enteric infections in children.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A Gn pig model was developed to study antibiotic-probiotic-HRV interactions in the context of a defined commensal microbiota (DM) that mimics aspects of the infant gut microbiota and demonstrated that Cipro use altered immune responses of DM-colonized neonatal Gn pigs, while EcN supplementation rescued these immune parameters partially or completely."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5025,"details":{"paperId":"c08de13c6f651837db78a4a1124ec60f6ebd4c00","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8920198","DOI":"10.1080/21645515.2020.1870395","CorpusId":"231965063","PubMed":"33605839"},"title":"Established and new rotavirus vaccines: a comprehensive review for healthcare professionals","abstract":"ABSTRACT Robust scientific evidence related to two rotavirus (RV) vaccines available worldwide demonstrates their significant impact on RV disease burden. Improving RV vaccination coverage may result in better RV disease control. To make RV vaccination accessible to all eligible children worldwide and improve vaccine effectiveness in high-mortality settings, research into new RV vaccines continues. Although current and in-development RV vaccines differ in vaccine design, their common goal is the reduction of RV disease risk in children <5 years old for whom disease burden is the most significant. Given the range of RV vaccines available, informed decision-making is essential regarding the choice of vaccine for immunization. This review aims to describe the landscape of current and new RV vaccines, providing context for the assessment of their similarities and differences.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY The disease Rotaviruses are a leading cause of acute diarrhea, also called gastroenterities, among young children. They can lead to servere dehydration, hospitilization, and even death. Several vaccines against rotavirus disease have been developed. Their design is based on: weakened human rotavirus that mimic natural infection without causing disease, such as Rotarix, Rotavin-M1, Rotavac and RV3-BB (not yet marketed) non-infective animal viruses such as RotaTeq, Rotasiil or LLR . new concepts, such as inactivated vaccines What is new? We reviewed the current, recently launched and soon-to-be-launched rotavirus vaccines and found that: Rotarix and RotaTeq have been used globally for more than a decade with demonstrated impact and favourable safety profile Limited data on the impact and safety profile are available to date for: Rotavin-M1 and LLR vaccines , locally marketed in Vietnam and China, respectively Rotavac and Rotasiil , licensed in india New vaccine concepts have been mainly investigated animal models with encouraging results What is the impact? Despite their different designs, the current rotavirus vaccines demonstrate effectiveness in protecting against rotairus gastroenterits. Data for most recent vacciness are currently limited, for which additional data are needed to demonstrate how they will perform on a larger scale, their added value in a real setting and ther safety profile.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The landscape of current and new RV vaccines is described, providing context for the assessment of their similarities and differences, and it is found that despite their different designs, the current rotavirus vaccines demonstrate effectiveness in protecting against rotairus gastroenterits."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2102,"details":{"paperId":"1410855021cd74912a7771be71950c71d654e969","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112398","CorpusId":"244088300","PubMed":"34781142"},"title":"Establishment of a rotavirus-infected zebrafish model and its application in drug screening.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A RV-infected zebrafish model with formulated relevant indicators both larvae and adult fish is established, which might be served as a high throughput platform for antiviral drug screening."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2071,"details":{"paperId":"f7f6b16cd50c3d667689bb64f2406814ae0f6cc6","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.bej.2022.108580","CorpusId":"251416684"},"title":"Establishment of a soluble expression and rapid purification system for self-assembling protein nanoparticle and characterization of its physiochemical properties","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4952,"details":{"paperId":"8d78ea00a9f326c674f549bae6b9bcc5b8b54551","externalIds":{"MAG":"2793166791","DOI":"10.1080/14760584.2018.1443008","CorpusId":"3502114","PubMed":"29463143"},"title":"Estimated impact of rotavirus vaccine on hospitalizations and deaths from rotavirus diarrhea among children <5 in Asia","abstract":"ABSTRACT Background: Of the 215,000 global deaths from rotavirus estimated in 2013, 41% occur in Asian countries.

To help policy makers assess the potential value of vaccination, we projected the reduction in rotavirus hospitalizations and deaths following a hypothetical national introduction of rotavirus vaccines in all countries in Asia using data on national-level rotavirus mortality, <5 population, rotavirus hospitalizations rates, routine vaccination coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. Methods: To quantify uncertainty, we generated 1,000 simulations of these inputs. Results: Our model predicted 710,000 fewer rotavirus hospitalizations, a 49% decrease from the 1,452,000 baseline hospitalizations and 35,000 fewer rotavirus deaths, a 40% decrease from the 88,000 baseline deaths if all 43 Asian countries had introduced rotavirus vaccine.

In this work, we used human enteroids, for the first time, as a model system to evaluate a plasmid-stabilized S. sonnei live attenuated vaccine strain, CVD 1233-SP, and a multivalent derivative, CVD 1233-SP::CS2-CS3, which expresses antigens from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The strains were also tested for immunogenicity and protective capacity in the guinea pig model, demonstrating their ability to elicit serum and mucosal antibody responses as well as protection against challenge with wild-type S. sonnei. These promising results highlight the utility of enteroids as an innovative preclinical model to evaluate Shigella vaccine candidates, constituting a significant advance for the development of preventative strategies against this important human pathogen.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Promising results highlight the utility of enteroids as an innovative preclinical model to evaluate Shigella vaccine candidates, constituting a significant advance for the development of preventative strategies against this important human pathogen."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":379,"details":{"paperId":"97ecfd7ef639ff7dc8b7fbfb0bf13b836c8a71c2","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1002/jmv.27809","CorpusId":"248404141","PubMed":"35474320"},"title":"Evaluation of a bivalent recombinant vaccine candidate targeting norovirus and rotavirus: Antibodies to rotavirus NSP4 exert antidiarrheal effects without virus neutralization","abstract":"We previously found that when tandemly expressed with SR69A‐VP8*, nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) of the rotavirus Wa strain exerts a minor effect on elevating the antibody responses targeting the rotavirus antigen VP8* of the 60‐valent nanoparticle SR69A‐VP8* but could fully protect mice from diarrhea induced by the rotavirus strain Wa.

In the present work we have analyzed the mechanism used by CD8+ T cells to clear rotavirus infection. We first determined that perforin knockout (perforin -/-) mice and lpr (fas-deficient) mice clear rotavirus infection with the same kinetics as control mice. When perforin -/- or perforin +/+ mice were depleted of CD8+ T cells by administration of an anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody, they showed a delay of 1 to 2 days in the clearance of rotavirus infection compared to the clearance time for untreated control mice, indicating that CD8+ T cells in both groups of mice participate in the resolution of primary rotavirus infection. In addition, passively transferred CD8+ T cells from rotavirus-infected perforin +/+ and perforin -/- mice were able to mediate viral clearance in Rag 2 knockout (Rag 2 -/-) mice chronically infected with rotavirus with similar kinetics, suggesting that CD8+ T cells from perforin -/- mice are as efficient as CD8+ T cells from perforin +/+ mice in clearing a rotavirus infection. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) was also shown to be unnecessary for the antirotavirus effect of CD8+ T cells: IFN-gamma knockout (IFN-gamma -/-) mice and JHD -/-, perforin -/-, and perforin +/+ mice depleted of IFN-gamma by administration of an anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody cleared rotavirus infection with the same kinetics as those for control mice.

In FMDV, virion protein 1 (VP1) is a major target of protective antibodies and is responsible for viral attachment to permissive cells via an RGD motif located in a distal surface loop. Although both viruses share considerable sequence identity, ERAV VP1 does not contain an RGD motif. To investigate antibody and receptor-binding properties of ERAV VP1, we have expressed full-length ERAV VP1 in Escherichia coli as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein (GST-VP1). GST-VP1 reacted specifically with antibodies present in serum from a rabbit immunized with purified ERAV virions and also in convalescent-phase sera from horses experimentally infected with ERAV. An antiserum raised in rabbits to GST-VP1 reacted strongly with viral VP1 and effectively neutralized ERAV infection in vitro. Using a flow cytometry-based binding assay, we found that GST-VP1, but not other GST fusion proteins, bound to cell surface receptors. This binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of purified ERAV virions, demonstrating the specificity of this interaction. A separate cell-binding assay also implicated GST-VP1 in receptor binding. Importantly, anti-GST-VP1 antibodies inhibited the binding of ERAV virions to Vero cells, suggesting that these antibodies exert their neutralizing effect by blocking viral attachment. Thus ERAV VP1, like its counterpart in FMDV, appears to be both a target of protective antibodies and involved directly in receptor binding. This study reveals the potential of recombinant VP1 molecules to serve as vaccines and diagnostic reagents for the control of ERAV infections.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"ERAV VP1 appears to be both a target of protective antibodies and involved directly in receptor binding, like its counterpart in FMDV, and the potential of recombinant VP1 molecules to serve as vaccines and diagnostic reagents for the control of ERAV infections is revealed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9069,"details":{"paperId":"df10d38e4ee89c4bb273c22494506fc7d064f9e2","externalIds":{"MAG":"3037936561","DOI":"10.31274/etd-20200624-34","CorpusId":"226651437"},"title":"Examination of viral infection and host response to define therapeutic potential of oncolytic mammalian orthoreovirus","abstract":"The International Agency for Research on Cancer estimates that 9.6 million people died of cancer in 2018. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, and is the most common in men within the United States. Development of new cancer therapies has helped many PCa patients experience remission, but far too many die due to tumor resistance toward therapy. Tumors are heterogeneous collections of aberrant cells growing uncontrollably, and as they progress, they evolve becoming more genetically and metabolically diverse throughout the tissue. Within the tumor, microenvironments form that differ dramatically from one region to another. One tumor microenvironment of particular interest is tumor hypoxia, an area of low oxygen that is increasingly resistant to cancer therapy. Within these hypoxic regions, the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF-1α) accumulates, enters the nucleus, and enhances transcription of genes involved in growth, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis, resulting in increased tumor aggressiveness. When patients have high amounts of HIF-1α accumulation within the blood serum, they typically have much poorer prognosis as compared to those without elevated HIF-1α. Novel HIF-1α inhibitors are being investigated for safety and efficacy to inhibit these effects, as well as to sensitize hypoxic tumors to current cancer therapies.

However, the relationship between MUC1 expression and tumor prognosis and its role in tumor immunity is still worth exploring. Methods: MUC1 expression was analyzed via GTEx database and TCGA database. We used the Kaplan-Meier survival estimation method to evaluate the influence of MUC1 on tumor prognosis through the survival information from TGCA database. The correlations between MUC1 and immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment were investigated through TIMER algorithm and ESTIMATE. In addition, we used Spearman correlation test to examine the correlation between MUC1 and TMB, MSI. Spearman correlation test was also designed to predict the correlation between MUC1 and immune checkpoint genes, four methyltransferases. Further, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to explore the potential mechanism of MUC1 in Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Results: Our study reported that MUC1 is highly expressed in most tumors, differing between cancer types. In most cancers, high expression of MUC1 means poor prognosis indicators, such as overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DSS), disease free survival (DFS) and progression free survival (PFS). MUC1 was positively correlated with infiltrating levels of B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils in LIHC, Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and Thyroid carcinoma (THCA). Besides, we reported that the expression of MUC1 correlated significantly with immune checkpoint gene, TMB and MSI and in most tumors. However, we found that MUC1 is negatively correlated with most immunotherapy-related indicators in BRCA and LUAD. The relationship between MUC1 and tumor neoantigens and DNA methylase is different in different tumors.In ACC and LIHC, MUC1 can promote the metabolism of many substances. MUC1 can inhibit amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, DNA replication, base excision repair, proteasome in ACC. Similarly, MUC1 inhibits axon guidance, the interaction of cytokine and cytokine receptor, focal adhesion, and endocytosis in LIHC. Conclusions: Our research demonstrates that MUC1 is correlated with prognosis and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including those of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils in different tumors. In addition, MUC1 is related to immune checkpoint gene, neoantigen, and some prognostic indicators of immunotherapy such as TMB and MSI, suggesting that MUC1 can also be invoked as a target and prognostic biomarker of immunotherapy. By analyzing the relationship between the expression of MUC1 and methyltransferase, we found that MUC1 regulates DNA methylation. Finally, we used GSEA to study the function of MUC1 in ACC and LIHC. Briefly, our study highlights the significance of MUC1 in the study of tumor immunity from the perspective of pan-cancer.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The research demonstrates that MUC1 is correlated with prognosis and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including those of B cells, CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils in different tumors, and negatively correlated with most immunotherapy-related indicators in BRCA and LUAD."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7213,"details":{"paperId":"ceaad724b8305bf20e1994194d58c78aee35d2d0","externalIds":{"MAG":"2607429781","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.66.11.6527-6532.1992","CorpusId":"37594382","PubMed":"1328679"},"title":"Expression, self-assembly, and antigenicity of the Norwalk virus capsid protein","abstract":"Norwalk virus capsid protein was produced by expression of the second and third open reading frames of the Norwalk virus genome, using a cell-free translation system and baculovirus recombinants.

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-HCMV activity of human preterm colostrum and clarify the role of colostrum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Preterm colostrum samples were collected and the EVs were purified and characterized. The in vitro anti-HCMV activity of both colostrum and EVs was tested against HCMV, and the viral replication step inhibited by colostrum-purified EVs was examined. We investigated the putative role EV surface proteins play in impairing HCMV infection using shaving experiments and proteomic analysis. The obtained results confirmed the antiviral action of colostrum against HCMV and demonstrated a remarkable antiviral activity of colostrum-derived EVs.

Previous studies indicate the p10 HP shares operational features with the fusion peptide motifs found within the enveloped virus membrane fusion proteins.

The p10 cystine loop may therefore function as a cystine noose, where fusion peptide activity is dependent on structural constraints within the noose that force solvent exposure of key hydrophobic residues. Moreover, inhibitors of cell surface thioreductase activity indicate that disruption of the disulfide bridge is important for p10-mediated membrane fusion.

However, implementation of RV vaccination has led to significant reductions in RV mortality, compared to the pre-vaccination era. This review presents 15 years of real-world experience with the oral live-attenuated human RV vaccine (HRV; Rotarix). HRV is currently introduced in ≥80 national immunization programs (NIPs), as 2 doses starting from 6 weeks of age. Areas covered The clinical development of HRV and post-marketing experience indicating the impact of HRV vaccination on RV disease was reviewed. Expert opinion In clinical trials, HRV displayed an acceptable safety profile and efficacy against RV-gastroenteritis, providing broad protection against heterotypic RV strains by reducing the consequences of severe RV disease in infants. Real-world evidence shows substantial, rapid reduction in the number of RV infections and associated hospitalizations following introduction of HRV in NIPs, regardless of economic setting. Indirect effects against RV disease are also observed, such as herd protection, decrease in nosocomial infections incidence, and a reduction of disease-related societal/healthcare costs. However, not all countries have implemented RV vaccination. Coverage remains suboptimal and should be improved to maximize the benefits of RV vaccination. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the context? Rotaviruses are a leading cause of diarrheal diseases worldwide. They account for substantial morbidity and mortality among young children under 5 years, with developing countries showing a higher disease burden. Although rotavirus vaccines have contributed to reductions in disease burden, they have not substantially averted deaths from rotavirus infection in the regions with the highest burden due to low coverage What is new? We reviewed almost 15 years of data from national immunization programs and private use settings to summarize the global experience with the rotavirus vaccine Rotarix (GSK). We showed that vaccination with Rotarix: Has a long term and substantial impact on disease burden in diverse geographic and socio-economic settings Significantly reduces diarrhea-related hospitalizations and death rates Provides indirect benefits such as herd protection to children who are too old or too young to be vaccinated; the reduction of hospital-acquired infections; and significant cost savings for healthcare systems, households and society. Why is this important? Despite promising real-world data and a favorable benefit-risk profile, the overall uptake of Rotarix is still suboptimal Increasing awareness of the high disease burden and significant vaccine impact is critical for motivating healthcare professionals to advocate for rotavirus vaccination and convincing policymakers to implement national rotavirus immunization","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Real-world evidence shows substantial, rapid reduction in the number of RV infections and associated hospitalizations following introduction of HRV in NIPs, regardless of economic setting."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4537,"details":{"paperId":"03d39fbcf3374cc8689e3a411b68b337a7393d5f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2016258999","DOI":"10.1042/BJ20021969","CorpusId":"38306027","PubMed":"12901721"},"title":"Fine mapping of sequential neutralization epitopes on the subunit protein VP8 of human rotavirus.","abstract":"The epitopes of the HRV (human rotavirus), especially those involved in virus neutralization, have not been determined in their entirety, and would have significant implications for HRV vaccine development.

To investigate these events, we generated a quadruple baculovirus recombinant that simultaneously expresses in Sf9 cells the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M1), and M2 proteins of influenza virus A/Udorn/72 (H3N2). Using this quadruple recombinant, we have been able to demonstrate by double-labeling immunofluorescence that matrix protein (M1) localizes in nuclei as well as at discrete areas of the plasma membrane where HA and NA colocalize at the cell surface. Western blot analysis of cell supernatant showed that M1, HA, and NA were secreted into the culture medium. Furthermore, these proteins comigrated in similar fractions when concentrated supernatant was subjected to differential centrifugation. Electron microscopic examination (EM) of these fractions revealed influenza VLPs bearing surface projections that closely resemble those of wild-type influenza virus. Immunogold labeling and EM demonstrated that the HA and NA were present on the surface of the VLPs. We further investigated the minimal number of structural proteins necessary for VLP assembly and release using single-gene baculovirus recombinants. Expression of M1 protein alone led to the release of vesicular particles, which in gradient centrifugation analysis migrated in a similar pattern to that of the VLPs. Immunoprecipitation of M1 protein from purified M1 vesicles, VLPs, or influenza virus showed that the relative amount of M1 protein associated with M1 vesicles or VLPs was higher than that associated with virions, suggesting that particle formation and budding is a very frequent event. Finally, the HA gene within the quadruple recombinant was replaced either by a gene encoding the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus or by a hybrid gene containing the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain of the HA and the ectodomain of the G protein. Each of these constructs was able to drive the assembly and release of VLPs, although enhanced recruitment of the G glycoprotein onto the surface of the particle was observed with the recombinant carrying a G/HA chimeric gene.

It gives rise to malnutrition and even death in children even though there were rotavirus vaccines. However, there is no effective anti-virus drugs for rotavirus, supporting treatments are used in the clinics. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been treating diarrhea for many years. Gegen Huangqin Huanglian Decoction (GHHD)is a classic prescription for diarrhea in TCM. With the development of clinical trials and basic studies, GHHD has been proved that a good curative effect on diarrhea. Therefore, a systematic review is necessary to improve available evidence for GHHD in therapy of children under 5 years old with rotavirus enteritis. Methods: Different studies from various databases will be involved in this study.

Reovirus replication and assembly occur within distinct structures called viral inclusions, which form in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Viral nonstructural proteins μNS and σNS and core protein μ2 play key roles in forming viral inclusions and recruiting other viral proteins and RNA to these structures for replication and assembly. However, the precise functions of these proteins in viral replication are poorly defined. Therefore, to better understand the functions of reovirus proteins associated with formation of viral inclusions, we used plasmid-based vectors to establish 293T cell lines stably expressing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for transcripts encoding the μ2, μNS, and σNS proteins of strain type 3 Dearing (T3D). Infectivity assays revealed that yields of T3D, but not those of strain type 1 Lang, were significantly decreased in 293T cells stably expressing μ2, μNS, or σNS siRNA. Stable expression of siRNAs specific for any one of these proteins substantially diminished viral dsRNA, protein synthesis, and inclusion formation, indicating that each is a critical component of the viral replication machinery. Using cell lines stably expressing μNS siRNA, we developed a complementation system to rescue viral replication by transient transfection with recombinant T3D μNS in which silent mutations were introduced into the sequence targeted by the μNS siRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that μNSC, which lacks the first 40 amino residues of μNS, is incapable of restoring reovirus growth in the complementation system.

ABSTRACT Rotavirus is a segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus that causes severe gastroenteritis in young children. We have established an efficient simplified rotavirus reverse genetics (RG) system that uses 11 T7 plasmids, each expressing a unique simian SA11 (+)RNA, and a cytomegalovirus support plasmid for the African swine fever virus NP868R capping enzyme. With the NP868R-based system, we generated recombinant rotavirus (rSA11/NSP3-FL-UnaG) with a genetically modified 1.5-kb segment 7 dsRNA encoding full-length nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3) fused to UnaG, a 139-amino-acid green fluorescent protein (FP). Analysis of rSA11/NSP3-FL-UnaG showed that the virus replicated efficiently and was genetically stable over 10 rounds of serial passaging. The NSP3-UnaG fusion product was well expressed in rSA11/NSP3-FL-UnaG-infected cells, reaching levels similar to NSP3 levels in wild-type recombinant SA11-infected cells. Moreover, the NSP3-UnaG protein, like functional wild-type NSP3, formed dimers in vivo. Notably, the NSP3-UnaG protein was readily detected in infected cells via live-cell imaging, with intensity levels ∼3-fold greater than those of the NSP1-UnaG fusion product of rSA11/NSP1-FL-UnaG. Our results indicate that FP-expressing recombinant rotaviruses can be made through manipulation of the segment 7 dsRNA without deletion or interruption of any of the 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of the virus. Because NSP3 is expressed at higher levels than NSP1 in infected cells, rotaviruses expressing NSP3-based FPs may be more sensitive tools for studying rotavirus biology than rotaviruses expressing NSP1-based FPs. This is the first report of a recombinant rotavirus containing a genetically engineered segment 7 dsRNA.

The broad use of two vaccines, which are based on RVA strains from Europe and North America, significantly reduced rotavirus disease burden worldwide. However, a lower vaccine effectiveness is recorded in some regions of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where diverse RVA strains are circulating. Here, a plasmid-based reverse genetics system was used to generate simian RVA reassortants with VP4 and VP7 proteins derived from African human RVA strains not previously adapted to cell culture. We were able to rescue 1/3 VP4 mono-reassortants, 3/3 VP7 mono-reassortants, but no VP4/VP7 double reassortant. Electron microscopy showed typical triple-layered virus particles for the rescued reassortants. All reassortants stably replicated in MA-104 cells; however, the VP4 reassortant showed significantly slower growth compared to the simian RVA or the VP7 reassortants. The results indicate that, at least in cell culture, human VP7 has a high reassortment potential, while reassortment of human VP4 from unadapted human RVA strains with simian RVA seems to be limited.

Mundt and V. N. Vakharia, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:11131–11136, 1996). To study the function of the 17-kDa nonstructural (NS) protein in viral growth and pathogenesis, we constructed a cDNA clone of IBDV segment A in which the first and only initiation codon (ATG) of NS protein was mutated to a stop codon (TAG). Transfection of Vero cells with combined transcripts of either modified or unmodified segment A, and with segment B, generated viable IBDV progeny. When chicken embryo fibroblast cells infected with transfectant viruses were analyzed by immunofluorescence assays using NS-specific antiserum, the mutant virus did not yield a fluorescence signal, indicating a lack of NS protein expression. Furthermore, replication kinetics and cytotoxic effects of the mutant virus were compared with those of the parental attenuated vaccine strain of IBDV (D78) in vitro. The mutant virus grew to slightly lower titers than D78 virus and exhibited decreased cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in cell culture. To evaluate the characteristics of the recovered viruses in vivo, we inoculated 3-week-old chickens with D78 or mutant virus and analyzed their bursa for histopathological lesions. The recovered D78 virus caused microscopic lesions and atrophy of the bursa, while the mutant virus failed to induce any pathological lesions or clinical signs of disease. In both instances, the virus was recovered from the bursa, and the presence or absence of mutation in these viruses was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of NS gene. Although the mutant virus exhibited a delay in replication in vivo, it induced levels of IBDV neutralizing antibodies that were similar to those of D78 virus. In addition, no reversion of mutation was detected in the mutant virus recovered from inoculated chickens. These results demonstrate that NS protein is dispensable for viral replication in vitro and in vivo and that it plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. Thus, generation of such NS protein-deficient virus will facilitate the study of immunosuppression and aid in the development of live-attenuated vaccines for IBDV.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Generation of such NS protein-deficient virus will facilitate the study of immunosuppression and aid in the development of live-attenuated vaccines for IBDV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2064,"details":{"paperId":"af68337f75694413e342c4a91c7fee33ebf49476","externalIds":{"MAG":"3110264290","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.007","CorpusId":"227235684","PubMed":"33250174"},"title":"Generation of recombinant rotaviruses encoding a split NanoLuc peptide tag.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"These findings demonstrate that the HiBiT reporter RV systems are powerful tools for studying the viral life cycle and pathogenesis, and a robust platform for developing novel antiviral drugs."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5864,"details":{"paperId":"27c2574a1abe462dfea3975d4077a6f21db5def5","externalIds":{"MAG":"2982573830","DOI":"10.1099/jgv.0.001322","CorpusId":"204973798","PubMed":"31665098"},"title":"Generation of simian rotavirus reassortants with diverse VP4 genes using reverse genetics.","abstract":"Species A rotaviruses (RVAs) are a major cause of gastroenteritis in animals and humans.

Myracrodruon urundeuva Allemão (Anacardiaceae) is widely used Brazilian folk medicine to treat inflammations and infections of the female genital tract, conditions of the stomach and throat, and to heal wounds on the skin and mucous membranes. Several pharmacological properties of extracts and compounds isolated from M. urundeuva are found in the literature, corroborating its uses as antiulcer and gastroprotective, anti‐inflammatory and analgesic, as well as antimicrobial. Despite these many uses in traditional herbal medicine, there are few reports of its toxic‐genetic effect. This work aimed to investigate the genotoxic and mutagenic potential in vivo of the dry decoction of M. urundeuva leaves on somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, through the Comet assay and somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART). Six concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 mg/mL) were studied after feeding individuals for 24 hr in culture medium hydrated with extracts of M. urundeuva. In the Comet assay, all concentrations showed a genotoxic effect significantly higher than the negative control group, treated with distilled water. The two highest concentrations were also superior to the positive control group, treated with cyclophosphamide (1 mg/mL). In the SMART, there was a mutagenic effect at all concentrations tested, with a clear dose‐dependent relationship. Both recombination and mutation account for these mutagenic effects.

Not only does human milk provide an excellent source of nutrition, it also contains components that protect against infection from a wide range of pathogens. Some of the protective properties of human milk can be attributed to the immunoglobulins. Yet, there is another level of defense provided by the \"sweet\" protective agents that human milk contains, including free oligosaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids. Sugar epitopes in human milk are similar to the glycan receptors that serve as pathogen adhesion sites in the human gastrointestinal tract and other epithelial cell surfaces; hence, the milk glycans can competitively bind to and remove the disease-causing microorganisms before they cause infection. The protective value of free oligosaccharides in human milk has been well researched and documented.

The use of GuHCl thereby allows for the spatiotemporal separation of poliovirus gene expression and RNA replication and provides a powerful tool to synchronize the initiation of negative-sense RNA synthesis during in vitro replication reactions. In the present study, we examined the effect of GuHCl on mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus from the family Reoviridae. MRV growth in murine L929 cells was reversibly inhibited by 15 mM GuHCl. Furthermore, 15 mM GuHCl provided specific inhibition of viral dsRNA synthesis while sparing both positive-sense RNA synthesis and viral mRNA translation. By using GuHCl to provide temporal separation of MRV gene expression and genome replication, we obtained evidence that MRV primary transcripts support sufficient protein synthesis to assemble morphologically normal viral factories containing functional replicase complexes. In addition, the coordinated use of GuHCl and cycloheximide allowed us to demonstrate that MRV dsRNA synthesis can occur in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis, although to only a limited extent.

In preparation for a potential AIV pandemic, multiple vaccine candidates are under development. In the case of H5N1 AIV, a clear shift in transmission from clade 1 to clade 2 viruses occurred in recent years. The virus-like particle (VLP) represents an economical approach to pandemic vaccine development. In the current study, we evaluated the humoral immune response in humans vaccinated with H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 (clade 2.1) VLP vaccine manufactured in Sf9 insect cells. The VLPs were comprised of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix 1 (M1) proteins. In an FDA-approved phase I/II human clinical study, two doses of H5N1 VLPs at 15, 45, or 90 μg HA/dose resulted in seroconversion and production of functional antibodies. Moreover, cross-reactivity against other clade 2 subtypes was demonstrated using virus neutralization assays. H5N1 whole-genome fragment phage display libraries (GFPDL) were used to elucidate the antibody epitope repertoire in postvaccination human sera. Diverse epitopes in HA1/HA2 and NA were recognized by postvaccination sera from the two high-dose groups, including large segments spanning the HA1 receptor binding domain. Importantly, the vaccine elicited sera that preferentially bound to an oligomeric form of recombinant HA1 compared with monomeric HA1. The oligomeric/monomeric HA1 binding ratios of the sera correlated with the virus neutralizing titers. Additionally, the two high-dose VLP vaccine groups generated NA-inhibiting antibodies that were associated with binding to a C-terminal epitope close to the sialic acid binding site.

Adult NK cells eliminated rotavirus-infected cholangiocytes shortly after infection, which prevented persistent rotavirus infection in bile ducts.

The goal of this study was to investigate whether Hsc70 could be an anti-HBV drug target. Our results showed that introducing Hsc70 increased HBV replication in HBV+ human hepatocytes (HepG2.2.15 cells). The coiled-coil region on Hsc70 (nucleotides 1533 to 1608; amino acids 511 to 536) was the key sequence for HBV replication. Knockdown of Hsc70 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) largely inhibited HBV replication with no cytotoxicity to the host. Using an Hsc70 mRNA screening assay, the natural compound oxymatrine (OMTR) was found to be a selective inhibitor for Hsc70 expression. Then, OMTR was used to investigate the potential of Hsc70 as an anti-HBV drug target. OMTR inhibited Hsc70 mRNA expression by 80% and HBV DNA replication by over 60% without causing cytotoxicity. The anti-HBV effect of OMTR appeared to be mediated by destabilizing Hsc70 mRNA. The half-life (T1/2) of Hsc70 mRNA decreased by 50% in OMTR-treated hepatocytes. The Hsc70 mRNA 3′-untranslated-region (UTR) sequence was the element responsible for OMTR's destabilization activity. OMTR suppressed HBV de novo synthesis at the reverse transcription stage from pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) to DNA and was active against either wild-type HBV or strains resistant to lamivudine, adefovir, and entecavir. Therefore, host Hsc70 could be a novel drug target against HBV, and OMTR appears to inhibit HBV replication by destabilizing Hsc70 mRNA.

Based on this premise, current live attenuated reassortant rotavirus vaccines include the four predominant serotypes of virus. We are evaluating subunit rotavirus vaccines, 2/6/7-VLPs and 2/4/6/7-VLPs, that contain only a single VP7 of serotype G1 or G3. In mice immunized parenterally twice, G3 virus-like particles (VLPs) induced a homotypic, whereas G1 VLPs induced a homotypic and heterotypic (G3) serum neutralizing immune response. Administration of three doses of G1 or G3 VLPs induced serum antibodies that neutralized five of seven different serotype test viruses. The inclusion of VP4 in the VLPs was not essential for the induction of heterotypic neutralizing antibody in mice. To confirm these results in another species, rabbits were immunized parenterally with two doses of 2/4/6/7-VLPs containing a G3 or G1 VP7, sequentially with G3 VLPs followed by G1 (G3/G1) VLPs, or with live or psoralen-inactivated SA11.

Nevertheless, to date, few data are available about the impact of pasteurization methods other than Holder on the antiviral activity of human milk. The present study was aimed at evaluating the antiviral activity of human milk against a panel of viral pathogens common in newborns and children (i.e., herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, and rhinovirus), and at assessing the effect of Holder and HTST pasteurization on milk's antiviral properties. The results indicate that human milk is endowed with antiviral activity against all viruses tested, although to a different extent. Unlike the Holder pasteurization, HTST preserved the inhibitory activity against cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus and herpes simplex virus type 2. By contrast, both methods reduced significantly the antiviral activities against rhinovirus and herpes simplex virus type 1.

In the crystals, a surface cleft on each DS-1 VP8* core binds N-terminal residues from a neighboring molecule. This cleft may function as a ligand binding site during rotavirus replication. We also report an escape mutant analysis, which allows the mapping of heterotypic neutralizing epitopes recognized by human monoclonal antibodies onto the surface of the VP8* core.

Currently, there are no established, high-throughput assays for the screening libraries of free (unmodified) HMOs against lectins. The present work describes a rapid and label- and immobilization-free assay, based on catch-and-release electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CaR-ESI-MS), capable of simultaneously screening mixtures of free HMOs of known concentration for binding to lectins in vitro. Ligand identification relies on the molecular weights (MWs), ion mobility separation arrival times, and collision-induced dissociation fingerprints of HMO anions released from the target protein in the gas phase. To establish the reliability of the assay, a library of 31 free HMOs, ranging in size from tri- to octasaccharide, was screened against three human galectin (hGal) proteins (a stable mutant of hGal1 (hGal-1), a C-terminal fragment of hGal-3 (hGal-3C) and hGal-7), with known HMO affinities. When implemented using an equimolar concentration library, the CaR-ESI-MS assay identified 100% of ligands with affinities >500 M-1 and ≥93% of all HMO ligands (hGal-1-31 of 31 ligands; hGal-3C-25 of 25; hGal-7-28 of 30); no false positives were detected. The assay also successfully identified the majority of the highest affinity HMO ligands (or isomer sets that contain the highest affinity ligands) in the library for each of the three hGal.

Nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) is responsible for the enterotoxic activity of these viruses in the villus epithelial cells. Amino acids 114-135 of NSP4 are known to form the diarrhea-inducing region of this viral enterotoxin. Therefore, developing an NSP4 lacking the enterotoxin domain could result in the introduction of a new subunit vaccine against rotaviruses in both humans and animals.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this study is the evaluation of rotavirus A NSP4 expression in E. coli expression system before and after removal of the diarrhea-inducing domain, which is the first step towards further immunological studies of the resulting protein.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSplicing by overlap extension (SOEing) PCR was used to remove the diarrhea-inducing sequence from the NSP4 cDNA. Both the full-length (FL-NSP4) and the spliced (S-NSP4) cDNA amplicons were cloned into pET-32c and pGEX-6P-2. Expression levels of the recombinant proteins were evaluated in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by Western blot analysis. In addition, the toxicity of pET plasmids bearing the S-NSP4 and FL-NSP4 fragments was investigated by plasmid stability test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor FL-NSP4, protein expression was detected for the strain containing the pGEX:FL-NSP4 plasmid, but not for the strain carrying pET:FL-NSP4.

We isolated an enteric bacterium strain (SENG-6), closely related to Enterobacter cloacae, bearing HBGA-like substances from a fecal sample of a healthy individual by using a biopanning technique with anti-HBGA antibodies. The binding capacities of four genotypes of norovirus-like particles (NoVLPs) to Enterobacter sp. SENG-6 cells were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that NoVLPs bound mainly to extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of Enterobacter sp. SENG-6, where the HBGA-like substances were localized.

The free glycans from pooled milk samples of donors with mixed Lewis and Secretor phenotypes were labeled with a fluorescent tag and separated via multidimensional HPLC to generate a tagged glycan library containing 247 HMG targets that were printed to generate the HMG shotgun glycan microarray (SGM). To investigate the potential role of HMGs as decoy receptors for rotavirus (RV), a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in children, we interrogated the HMG SGM with recombinant forms of VP8* domains of the RV outer capsid spike protein VP4 from human neonatal strains N155(G10P[11]) and RV3(G3P[6]) and a bovine strain, B223(G10P[11]).

These complementary structural approaches resulted in the identification of 32 glycans based on RV VP8* binding, many of which are novel HMGs, whose detailed structural assignments by MSn are described in a companion report.

Exposure to DON significantly reduced vaccine-specific immune responses and the percentages of Tbet+ Th1 cells and B cells in the spleen.

They can also act as immune modulators and as colonic maturation stimulators in breast-fed infants. These functions could be mediated by biological interaction between a variety of HMOs and lectins including galectins, selectins and siglecs. There are more than 100 HMOs; they have structural units such as H type 1: Fucα1-2Galβ1-3GlcNAc, Lewis a: Galβ1-3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAc, Lewis b: Fucα1-2Galβ1-3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAc, Lewis x: Galβ1-4(Fuc α1-3)GlcNAc, sialyl Lewis a: Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAc, and sialyl Lewis x: Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc. It can be expected that these units may be utilized as tools for studies on the sugar-binding specificities of lectins including galectins, monoclonal antibodies, virus capsid proteins and bacterial toxins. This mini-review presents the dataset of comprehensive HMO structures, including recently clarified ones, in tabular form, for its utilization in such studies, including those of carbohydratebinding specificity of galectins. In addition, this review introduces recent in vivo and clinical studies, which may be relevant to the biological functions and future utilization of HMOs. A. Introduction Human milk contains around 60 g/L of lactose (Galβ1-4Glc), as well as 12–13 g/L of a variety of milk oligosaccharides in mature milk and 22–24 g/L in colostrum. Whereas human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) comprise several monosaccharide components, such as glucose (Glc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose (Gal), fucose (Fuc) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), they always have a lactose unit at their reducing ends. Although by 2009 the structures of about 115 HMOs had been characterized and clarified based on 13 core series (1, 2), a comprehensive database, including large novel structures, had not been described. When breast-fed infants consume their mother’s milk, the majority of the HMOs are not digested and absorbed within the small intestine and therefore reach the infant’s colon. It has been suggested from in vitro studies that the HMOs function as prebiotics and decoy receptors, inhibiting the attachment of certain types of pathogenic microorganisms to the colonic mucosa, and as modulators of colonic epithelial maturation (1, 3–5). It has been also shown that some strains of Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum ssp. infantis, and B. breve are able to grow in medium containing HMOs as the only carbon source (6–8). It has been also clarified that B. bifidum is characterized by a unique metabolic pathway in which HMOs are digested by several extracellular and intracellular glycosidases (7). Notably, low concentrations of some HMOs are detected in plasma from venous blood after the consumption of breast milk (9, 10). Thus, it appears that a minor part of HMOs is absorbed within the small intestine and enters the circulation. It is possible that those HMOs have immune modulation effects such as anti-inflammation, as suggested by in vitro studies using blood leukocytes (11), platelets and endothelial cells (12). It can be assumed that the recognition of those HMOs by some endogenous lectins including galectins, selectins and siglecs is related to those biological activities of HMOs. Therefore, studies on the interaction between HMOs and lectins may generate useful information relating to the utilization of HMOs in therapy, such as immunomodulation and inhibition of the establishment of infection. Notably, as some HMOs have been recently produced on an industrial scale (13), these studies combined with advances in the industrial production of HMOs may in near future open up the possibility of the utilization of HMOs for the treatment and/or prevention of human diseases. HMOs consist of more than 100 individual molecules. They have been so far utilized as tools for studies on the sugar binding MINIREVIEW doi: 10.4052/tigg.1734.1SE (Article for special issue on Galectins)","publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This mini-review presents the dataset of comprehensive HMO structures, including recently clarified ones, in tabular form, for its utilization in such studies, including those of carbohydratebinding specificity of galectins."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9597,"details":{"paperId":"020392c9300e15edcf5dd66706fc62f1fea42b65","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"6164445","MAG":"2883610225","DOI":"10.3390/nu10091161","CorpusId":"52100458","PubMed":"30149573"},"title":"Human Milk Oligosaccharides: 2′-Fucosyllactose (2′-FL) and Lacto-N-Neotetraose (LNnT) in Infant Formula","abstract":"The authors reviewed the published evidence on the presence of oligosaccharides in human milk (HMO) and their benefits in in vitro and in vivo studies.

PubMed was searched from January 1990 to April 2018. The amount of HMOs in mother’s milk is a dynamic process as it changes over time. Many factors, such as duration of lactation, environmental, and genetic factors, influence the amount of HMOs. HMOs may support immune function development and provide protection against infectious diseases directly through the interaction of the gut epithelial cells or indirectly through the modulation of the gut microbiota, including the stimulation of the bifidobacteria. The limited clinical data suggest that the addition of HMOs to infant formula seems to be safe and well tolerated, inducing a normal growth and suggesting a trend towards health benefits. HMOs are one of the major differences between cow’s milk and human milk, and available evidence indicates that these components do have a health promoting benefit.

To address this global health challenge, 2 oral vaccines [Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) and RotaTeq (Merck & Co., Inc.)] were licensed in 2006; as of March 2017, 92 countries are using them in their immunization programs. However, many children in the developing world remain at high risk of rotavirus infection, and in 2013, rotavirus infections still accounted for 38% of all cases of diarrhea (2) and were responsible for the deaths of 215,000 children <5 y of age and hospitalizations for hundreds of thousands more (1). There are several reasons underlying this disparity. First, only half of the 10 countries with the greatest number of rotavirus-related deaths have introduced rotavirus vaccines nationally (3). Second, although rotavirus vaccines in highand middle-income countries are highly effective (90–95% protection against diarrhea) and have reduced rotavirus gastroenteritis (4), rotavirus vaccines are less efficacious (<50% protection) in developing countries, which have the greatest burden of disease (5). Last, in places where people live in close proximity with their animals, reassortment of rotavirus strains between species (6) as well as interspecies transmission of nonreassorted rotavirus (7) have been shown, resulting in exposure to novel strains of rotavirus. Thus, identifying approaches for preventing or reducing the severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis remains a priority. Breastfed infants have a lower incidence of rotavirus infection than do formula-fed infants (8), which has been attributed to the presence of immunoglobulins (9) and other bioactive components in human milk, including non-immunoglobulin proteins and milk-fat globule membrane (10, 11). Until recently, less attention had been paid to human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), although they are obvious candidates given that interaction with cellular glycans is a critical initial step in the pathogenesis of many infectious agents and the structural similarity of HMOs to glycans that serve as pathogen-binding sites on cell membranes (12, 13). For animal rotavirus strains, sialic acid (SA) is the key cellular glycan, whereas many human rotavirus strains bind nonsialylated glycoconjugates, called histoblood group antigens, in a strain-specific manner (13). Our laboratory previously studied the ability of HMOs to reduce infectivity of an SA-dependent porcine rotavirus strain [Ohio State University strain P9(7), G5]. Two SA-containing HMOs [3#sialyllactose (3#SL) and 6#-sialyllactose (6#SL)] inhibited rotavirus infectivity in vitro (14); and both lacto-N-neotetraose, a neutral HMO, and the sialylated HMOs reduced rotavirus infectivity in piglet ileal loops in situ (14). In the piglet, a mixture of HMOs reduced the duration of rotavirus diarrhea and modulated the microbiome and both mucosal (15) and systemic (16) immunity. However, how HMOs affect infectivity of human rotavirus strains was unknown. In this issue of the Journal, Laucirica et al. (17) screened 4 oligosaccharides [2#fucosyllactose (2#FL), 3#SL, 6#SL, and galacto-oligosaccharides] for their ability to inhibit infectivity of 2 human rotavirus strains. The G1P[8] strains are the most predominant cause of rotavirus diarrhea worldwide and are a component of the RotaTeq and Rotarix vaccines (18). The authors observed rotavirus strain– and oligosaccharide-specific and dosedependent effects: 1) the G2P[4] strain was more sensitive than G1P[8] to all of the oligosaccharides, showing, on average, a reduction of$50% compared with a 25–50% reduction in infectivity, respectively; 2) 2#FLwasmore inhibitory againstG1P[8] and sialylated HMOs were more effective against G2P[4]; 3) for G2P[4], 3#SL+6#SL at the ratio in human milk was more effective than 3#SL or 6#SL alone; and 4) oligosaccharides exerted their effects by interacting with the rotavirus, not the cell. In summary, fucosylated and sialylated HMOs and galactooligosaccharides, a common prebiotic addition to infant formula (19), reduced infectivity of human rotavirus strains in vitro. Although this is a first step, our work in the piglet model with a porcine-specific rotavirus strain showed that HMOs that inhibited rotavirus in vitro (14) also were effective in situ (14) and in vivo (15), suggesting that HMOs could reduce rotavirus infectivity in human infants. This work is timely due to the recent addition of 2#FL (20) or 2#FL+lacto-N-neotetraose (21) to infant formulas. Neither 3#SL nor 6#SL has been added to formula, which, on the basis of the findings of the current study, should be considered to more closely approximate the benefits of human milk.","publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are screened for their ability to inhibit infectivity of 2 human rotavirus strains and reassortment of rotav virus strains between species as well as interspecies transmission of nonreassorted rotvirus strains have been shown."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9453,"details":{"paperId":"308b65c28d7c5cc97fa3d3b00778a7de1e53974c","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8961778","DOI":"10.3390/biomedicines10020346","CorpusId":"246551803","PubMed":"35203555"},"title":"Human Milk Oligosaccharides: Potential Applications in COVID-19","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health crisis with more than four million deaths worldwide.

Several components in breast milk may be responsible for these different outcomes, but bioactive proteins/peptides likely play a major role. Some proteins in breast milk are comparatively resistant towards digestion and may therefore exert their functions in the gastrointestinal tract in intact form or as larger fragments. Other milk proteins may be partially digested in the upper small intestine and the resulting peptides may exert functions in the lower small intestine. Lactoferrin, lysozyme and secretory IgA have been found intact in the stool of breastfed infants and are therefore examples of proteins that are resistant against proteolytic degradation in the gut. Together, these proteins serve protective roles against infection and support immune function in the immature infant. α-lactalbumin, β-casein, κ-casein and osteopontin are examples of proteins that are partially digested in the upper small intestine, and the resulting peptides influence functions in the gut.

This had been attributed primarily to the secretory antibodies and prebiotic factors in human milk. Oligosaccharides are the third largest component of human milk. They were initially considered to be functionless by-products of glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis during milk production. However, in the past few decades it has become apparent that the human milk oligosaccharides are composed of thousands of components, at least some of which protect against pathogens. Oligosaccharide protection against infectious agents may result in part from their prebiotic characteristics, but is thought to be primarily due to their inhibition of pathogen binding to host cell ligands. Most human milk oligosaccharides are fucosylated, and their production depends on enzymes encoded by the genes associated with expression of the Lewis blood group system. The expression of specific fucosylated oligosaccharides in milk thus varies in relation to maternal Lewis blood group type, and is significantly associated with the risk of infectious disease in breastfed infants. Specific fucosylated moieties of oligosaccharides and related glycoconjugates (glycans) are able to inhibit binding and disease by specific pathogens. This review presents the argument that specific glycans, especially the oligosaccharides, are the major constituent of an innate immune system of human milk whereby the mother protects her infant from enteric and other pathogens through breastfeeding. The large input of energy expended by the mother in the synthesis of milk oligosaccharides is consistent with the human reproductive strategy of large parental input into rearing relatively few offspring through a prolonged period of maturation.

Herein, the anti-RV activity of oligosaccharides was tested in an established in vitro system for assessing cellular binding and viral infectivity/replication, and also tested in a newly developed, acute RV infection, in situ piglet model. For the in vitro work, crude HMO isolated from pooled HM, neutral HMO (lacto-N-neotetraose, LNnT; 2'-fucosyllactose) and acidic HMO (aHMO, '-sialyllactose, 3'-SL; -sialyllactose, -SL) were tested against the porcine OSU strain and human RV Wa strain. The RV Wa strain was not inhibited by any oligosaccharides. However, the RV OSU strain infectivity was dose-dependently inhibited by sialic acid (SA)-containing HMO. 3'-SL and 6'-SL concordantly inhibited (125)I-radiolabelled RV cellular binding and infectivity/replication. For the in situ study, a midline laparotomy was performed on 21-d-old formula-fed piglets and six 10 cm loops of ileum were isolated in situ.

Methods We conducted a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in Indonesia to evaluate the efficacy of an oral human neonatal rotavirus vaccine (RV3‐BB) in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy newborns received three doses of RV3‐BB, administered according to a neonatal schedule (0 to 5 days, 8 weeks, and 14 weeks of age) or an infant schedule (8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 18 weeks of age), or placebo. The primary analysis was conducted in the per‐protocol population, which included only participants who received all four doses of vaccine or placebo within the visit windows, with secondary analyses performed in the intention‐to‐treat population, which included all participants who underwent randomization. Results Among the 1513 participants in the per‐protocol population, severe rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred up to the age of 18 months in 5.6% of the participants in the placebo group (28 of 504 babies), in 1.4% in the neonatal‐schedule vaccine group (7 of 498), and in 2.7% in the infant‐schedule vaccine group (14 of 511). This resulted in a vaccine efficacy of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 91) in the neonatal‐schedule group (P<0.001), 51% (95% CI, 7 to 76) in the infant‐schedule group (P=0.03), and 63% (95% CI, 34 to 80) in the neonatal‐schedule and infant‐schedule groups combined (combined vaccine group) (P<0.001). Similar results were observed in the intention‐to‐treat analysis (1649 participants); the vaccine efficacy was 68% (95% CI, 35 to 86) in the neonatal‐schedule group (P=0.001), 52% (95% CI, 11 to 76) in the infant‐schedule group (P=0.02), and 60% (95% CI, 31 to 76) in the combined vaccine group (P<0.001). Vaccine response, as evidenced by serum immune response or shedding of RV3‐BB in the stool, occurred in 78 of 83 participants (94%) in the neonatal‐schedule group and in 83 of 84 participants (99%) in the infant‐schedule group. The incidence of adverse events was similar across the groups. No episodes of intussusception occurred within the 21‐day risk period after administration of any dose of vaccine or placebo, and one episode of intussusception occurred 114 days after the third dose of vaccine in the infant‐schedule group. Conclusions RV3‐BB was efficacious in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis when administered according to a neonatal or an infant schedule in Indonesia.

From this viewpoint, the effectiveness of STD NMR, Tr-NOESY, and STD-TOCSY has been utilized to evaluate the binding potential of the natural extract of Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, used as a herbal medicine in Brazil, towards human serum albumin. Moreover, 1D-DOSY experiments have also been carried out for the discriminations of different molecular weight compounds present in this extract. Following the STD, Tr-NOESY, and TOCSY analysis, a hyphenated system comprising LC-SPE-NMR was utilized to see the complete structural assignments through 2D spectra. The combined results from NMR spectroscopy and separation methods provided myricetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside (1), quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside (2), quercetin-3-O-xylopyranoside (3), and quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside (4) as the active site blockers. Moreover, epitope results and additional Tr-NOESY cross peaks suggested the presence of the flattened conformations of these ligands within the ligand–HSA complex through the edge protons. Similarly, STD competition studies with the ligand–HSA complex were demonstrated by varying the concentration of spy molecule that selectively binds with Sudlow's site II. Finally, docking simulations targeting both Sudlow sites (I and II) were performed, which interestingly mimic the STD competition results and showed that these compounds (1–4) are more prone towards binding site-1 inhibition.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the immunoglobulin G immune response to baculovirus-expressed full-length RRV VP4, full-length VP8*, and the amino-terminal polypeptide of VP5* called VP5*(1) (amino acids 248 to 474).

All three recombinant proteins were antigenically conserved, since they reacted with a library of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed at VP4. There was a high percentage of seroresponders to VP4 (61%) or to VP8* (52%), but fewer infants seroresponded to VP5*(1) (11%).

Oxysterols, defined as oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, include endogenous (naturally occurring) cholesterol metabolites as well as semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives. We have previously studied the use of semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives as drug candidates for inhibition of cancer, fibrosis, and bone regeneration. In this study, we have screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, using a cell culture infection assay. We show that the natural oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, substantially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cultured cells. Among semi-synthetic oxysterols, Oxy186 displayed antiviral activity comparable to natural oxysterols. In addition, related oxysterol analogues Oxy210 and Oxy232 displayed more robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, reducing viral replication more than 90% at 10 μM and 99% at 15 μM, respectively. When orally administered in mice, peak plasma concentrations of Oxy210 fall into a therapeutically relevant range (19 μM), based on the dose-dependent curve for antiviral activity in our cell culture infection assay.

To better define these responses, we used a shotgun glycomics approach in which N-glycans from schistosome egg glycoproteins were prepared, derivatized, separated, and used to generate an egg shotgun glycan microarray. This array was interrogated with sera from infected mice, rhesus monkeys, and humans and with glycan-binding proteins and antibodies to gather information about the structures of antigenic glycans, which also were analyzed by mass spectrometry. A major glycan antigen targeted by IgG from different infected species is the FLDNF epitope [Fucα3GalNAcβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAc-R], which is also recognized by the IgG monoclonal antibody F2D2. The FLDNF antigen is expressed by all life stages of the parasite in mammalian hosts, and F2D2 can kill schistosomula in vitro in a complement-dependent manner. Different antisera also recognized other glycan determinants, including core β-xylose and highly fucosylated glycans.

Results: A 20-aa peptide (namely pDGE-RGD) derived from equine lactahderin inhibits human rotavirus infectivity. Conclusion: pDGE-RGD interacts specifically with α2β1 integrin, thus hindering the rotavirus-cell attachment process. Significance: The discovery of the pDGE-RGD peptide may prove useful in the development of inhibitors of receptor recognition by rotavirus or other integrin-using viruses. Human rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and children under the age of 5 years in both developed and developing countries. Human lactadherin, a milk fat globule membrane glycoprotein, inhibits human rotavirus infection in vitro, whereas bovine lactadherin is not active. Moreover, it protects breastfed infants against symptomatic rotavirus infections. To explore the potential antiviral activity of lactadherin sourced by equines, we undertook a proteomic analysis of milk fat globule membrane proteins from donkey milk and elucidated its amino acid sequence. Alignment of the human, bovine, and donkey lactadherin sequences revealed the presence of an Asp-Gly-Glu (DGE) α2β1 integrin-binding motif in the N-terminal domain of donkey sequence only. Because integrin α2β1 plays a critical role during early steps of rotavirus host cell adhesion, we tested a minilibrary of donkey lactadherin-derived peptides containing DGE sequence for anti-rotavirus activity. A 20-amino acid peptide containing both DGE and RGD motifs (named pDGE-RGD) showed the greatest activity, and its mechanism of antiviral action was characterized; pDGE-RGD binds to integrin α2β1 by means of the DGE motif and inhibits rotavirus attachment to the cell surface.

Currently, there are no specific antiviral therapies available. RV is a nonenveloped virus with a segmented double-stranded RNA genome. Viral genome replication and assembly of transcriptionally active double-layered particles (DLPs) take place in cytoplasmic viral structures called viroplasms. In this study, we describe strong impairment of the early stages of RV replication induced by a small molecule known as an RNA polymerase III inhibitor, ML-60218 (ML). This compound was found to disrupt already assembled viroplasms and to hamper the formation of new ones without the need for de novo transcription of cellular RNAs. This phenotype was correlated with a reduction in accumulated viral proteins and newly made viral genome segments, disappearance of the hyperphosphorylated isoforms of the viroplasm-resident protein NSP5, and inhibition of infectious progeny virus production. In in vitro transcription assays with purified DLPs, ML showed dose-dependent inhibitory activity, indicating the viral nature of its target. ML was found to interfere with the formation of higher-order structures of VP6, the protein forming the DLP outer layer, without compromising its ability to trimerize. Electron microscopy of ML-treated DLPs showed dose-dependent structural damage. Our data suggest that interactions between VP6 trimers are essential, not only for DLP stability, but also for the structural integrity of viroplasms in infected cells. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus gastroenteritis is responsible for a large number of infant deaths in developing countries. Unfortunately, in the countries where effective vaccines are urgently needed, the efficacy of the available vaccines is particularly low. Therefore, the development of antivirals is an important goal, as they might complement the available vaccines or represent an alternative option. Moreover, they may be decisive in fighting the acute phase of infection. This work describes the inhibitory effect on rotavirus replication of a small molecule initially reported as an RNA polymerase III inhibitor. The molecule is the first chemical compound identified that is able to disrupt viroplasms, the viral replication machinery, and to compromise the stability of DLPs by targeting the viral protein VP6. This molecule thus represents a starting point in the development of more potent and less cytotoxic compounds against rotavirus infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The inhibitory effect on rotavirus replication of a small molecule initially reported as an RNA polymerase III inhibitor, ML-60218 (ML), is described, which is the first chemical compound identified that is able to disrupt viroplasms, the viral replication machinery, and to compromise the stability of DLPs by targeting the viral protein VP6."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7285,"details":{"paperId":"310157712d62e67ed59fe454df4def6d963710d1","externalIds":{"MAG":"1518848617","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.71.1.419-426.1997","CorpusId":"30358997","PubMed":"8985366"},"title":"Identification of a T-helper cell epitope on the rotavirus VP6 protein","abstract":"In this work, we have studied the T-helper (Th)-cell response against rotavirus, in a mouse model.

However, oral administration is intrinsically challenging for pharmacologically interesting drug classes, in particular pharmaceutical peptides, due to the biological barriers associated with the gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we start by summarizing the pharmacological performance of several clinically relevant orally administrated therapeutic peptides, highlighting their low bioavailabilities. Thus, there is a strong need to increase the transport of peptide drugs across the intestinal barrier to realize future treatment needs and further development in the field. Currently, progress is hampered by a lack of understanding of transport mechanisms that govern intestinal absorption and transport of peptide drugs, including the effects of the permeability enhancers commonly used to mediate uptake. We describe how, for the past decades, mechanistic insights have predominantly been gained using functional assays with end-point read-out capabilities, which only allow indirect study of peptide transport mechanisms. We then focus on fluorescence imaging that, on the other hand, provides opportunities to directly visualize and thus follow peptide transport at high spatiotemporal resolution. Consequently, it may provide new and detailed mechanistic understanding of the interplay between the physicochemical properties of peptides and cellular processes; an interplay that determines the efficiency of transport.

In the present study systemic and mucosal IgG and IgA responses were induced by immunizing BALB/c mice intranasally with a combination of recombinant RV VP6 protein (subgroup II [SGII]) and norovirus (NoV) virus-like particles (VLPs) used in a candidate vaccine.

RV disease accounts for more than one-third of all diarrhea-related hospitalizations and 500,000–600,000 deaths per year [2–4]; most deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia [3, 4]. Direct medical and indirect annual costs associated with RV disease are estimated to be €400 million in Europe [5–7] and to exceed US$ 1 billion in the United States [8]. \n \nRV strains form a genus of the Reoviridae family and possess a genome of 11 segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA, encoding 6 structural viral proteins (VPs) and 6 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). The infectious particle (ie, virion) consists of 3 layers: the inner layer (core) contains the viral genome, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, VP1), the capping enzyme (VP3), and the scaffolding protein (VP2); the core is surrounded by a middle layer (VP6), and the outer layer consists of VP7 and VP4 [9]. \n \nRV infects mature enterocytes in the small intestine. Viral replication leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ level (effected by NSP4), increased Cl- secretion, and shut-off of host cell protein synthesis (effected by NSP3), resulting in acute osmotic and secretory diarrhea (described in [9]). Various RV genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AGE [10]. After RV infection, a viremic stage of, at present, unclear significance has been identified in humans and experimental animals [11–13]. \n \nThe RV-encoded NSP1 blocks interferon (IFN) production by various pathways [14–17]. RV infection down-regulates the IFN- and pro-inflammatory cytokine–associated pathways in calves [18]. \n \nRV strains have a high genomic and antigenic diversity and are classified into at least 7 different groups (A–G), distinguished by different VP6. Most human RV infections are caused by group A RV strains, which are further subdivided into at least 2 subgroups (I, II), 23 G types (determined by VP7, a glycoprotein), and 31 P types (determined by VP4, a protease-sensitive protein) [9, 19–21]. \n \nRV strains with different G and P types cocirculate and change in geographical regions over time [22–25]. In temperate climate regions, most cocirculating RV strains are types G1–G4 and G9 (typically G1P1A[8], G2P1B[4], G3P1A[8], G4P1A[8], and G9P1A[8]), but other G types (G5, G8, G10, and G12), in combination with various P types, may be most prevalent in tropical areas [21, 23, 24]. \n \nNonspecific (innate) and acquired virus-specific humoral and cellular immune responses are elicited by RV infection [26, 27] or RV vaccination [28–33]. Although currently licensed vaccines are highly efficacious in protecting children from severe RV AGE, the molecular mechanisms of protection are not fully understood.

In this study, the nontoxic B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) was employed as intra-molecular adjuvant to improve the immunogenicity of VP8-1. Both, the N-terminal and C-terminal fusion proteins, were purified to homogeneity, at which stage they formed pentamers, and showed significantly higher immunogenicity and protective efficacy than a VP8-1/aluminum hydroxide mixture in a mouse model. Compared to VP8-1-CTB, CTB-VP8-1 showed higher binding activity to both, GM1 and the conformation sensitive neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific to VP8. More importantly, CTB-VP8-1 elicited higher titers of neutralizing antibodies and conferred higher protective efficacy than VP8-1-CTB.

Identifying an immunological correlate of protection in the course of field trials of efficacy, animal models (when available), or human challenge studies is also invaluable. In industrialized country populations, live attenuated vaccines (e.g. polio, typhoid, and rotavirus) mimic natural infection and generate robust protective immune responses. In contrast, a major challenge is to understand and overcome the barriers responsible for the diminished immunogenicity and efficacy of the same enteric vaccines in underprivileged populations in developing countries. Success in developing vaccines against some enteric pathogens has heretofore been elusive (e.g. Shigella). Different types of oral vaccines can selectively or inclusively elicit mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A and serum immunoglobulin G antibodies and a variety of cell‐mediated immune responses. Areas of research that require acceleration include interaction between the gut innate immune system and the stimulation of adaptive immunity, development of safe yet effective mucosal adjuvants, better understanding of homing to the mucosa of immunologically relevant cells, and elicitation of mucosal immunologic memory.

Early life forms a critical window predisposing for health or disease. Therefore, this can also be a window of opportunity for allergy prevention. Postnatally the gut needs to mature, and the microbiome is built which further drives the training of infant's immune system. Immunomodulatory components in breastmilk protect the infant in this crucial period by; providing nutrients that contain substrates for the microbiome, supporting intestinal barrier function, protecting against pathogenic infections, enhancing immune development and facilitating immune tolerance. The presence of a diverse human milk oligosaccharide (HMOS) mixture, containing several types of functional groups, points to engagement in several mechanisms related to immune and microbiome maturation in the infant's gastrointestinal tract. In recent years, several pathways impacted by HMOS have been elucidated, including their capacity to; fortify the microbiome composition, enhance production of short chain fatty acids, bind directly to pathogens and interact directly with the intestinal epithelium and immune cells. The exact mechanisms underlying the immune protective effects have not been fully elucidated yet. We hypothesize that HMOS may be involved in and can be utilized to provide protection from developing allergic diseases at a young age. In this review, we highlight several pathways involved in the immunomodulatory effects of HMOS and the potential role in prevention of allergic diseases. Recent studies have proposed possible mechanisms through which HMOS may contribute, either directly or indirectly, via microbiome modification, to induce oral tolerance. Future research should focus on the identification of specific pathways by which individual HMOS structures exert protective actions and thereby contribute to the capacity of the authentic HMOS mixture in early life allergy prevention.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is hypothesized that HMOS may be involved in and can be utilized to provide protection from developing allergic diseases at a young age and the potential role in prevention of allergic diseases is highlighted."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9454,"details":{"paperId":"df82a041fd1ab77e5bb867228f64764668ac2437","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9219990","DOI":"10.3390/biomedicines10061219","CorpusId":"249073934","PubMed":"35740242"},"title":"Immunomodulatory Properties of Human Breast Milk: MicroRNA Contents and Potential Epigenetic Effects","abstract":"Infants who are exclusively breastfed in the first six months of age receive adequate nutrients, achieving optimal immune protection and growth. In addition to the known nutritional components of human breast milk (HBM), i.e., water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins, it is also a rich source of microRNAs, which impact epigenetic mechanisms. This comprehensive work presents an up-to-date overview of the immunomodulatory constituents of HBM, highlighting its content of circulating microRNAs. The epigenetic effects of HBM are discussed, especially those regulated by miRNAs. HBM contains more than 1400 microRNAs. The majority of these microRNAs originate from the lactating gland and are based on the remodeling of cells in the gland during breastfeeding. These miRNAs can affect epigenetic patterns by several mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA regulation, which could ultimately result in alterations in gene expressions. Therefore, the unique microRNA profile of HBM, including exosomal microRNAs, is implicated in the regulation of the genes responsible for a variety of immunological and physiological functions, such as FTO, INS, IGF1, NRF2, GLUT1 and FOXP3 genes. Hence, studying the HBM miRNA composition is important for improving the nutritional approaches for pregnancy and infant’s early life and preventing diseases that could occur in the future.

These factors could diminish the immunogenicity of oral rotavirus vaccines, particularly if breastfeeding occurs close to the time of vaccine administration. Methods Between April 2011 and November 2012, we conducted an open label, randomized trial to compare the immunogenicity of Rotarix (RV1) in infants whose breastfeeding was withheld one hour before through one hour after vaccination with that in infants breastfed at the time of vaccination. The trial was conducted in the peri-urban area of Ibrahim Hyderi in Karachi, Pakistan. Both groups received three doses of RV1 at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. Seroconversion (anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies ≥20 U/mL in subjects seronegative at 6 weeks of age) following three vaccine doses (6, 10 and 14 weeks) was determined at 18 weeks of age (primary objective) and seroconversion following two doses (6 and 10 weeks) was determined at 14 weeks of age (secondary objective). Results Four hundred eligible infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio between the withholding breastfeeding and immediate breastfeeding arms. Overall, 353 (88.3%) infants completed the study according to protocol; 181 in the withholding breastfeeding group and 172 in the immediate breastfeeding group. After three RV1 doses, anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion was 28.2% (95% CI: 22.1; 35.1) in the withholding arm and 37.8% (95% CI: 30.9; 45.2) in the immediate breastfeeding arm (difference: -9.6% [95% CI: -19.2; 0.2] p=0.07). After two doses of RV1, seroconversion was 16.6% (95% CI: 11.9; 22.7) in the withholding arm and 29.1% (95% CI: 22.8, 36.3) in the immediate breastfeeding arm (difference: -12.5% [95% CI: -21.2,-3.8] p=0.005). Conclusions Withholding breastfeeding around the time of RV1 vaccine administration did not lead to increased anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion compared with that seen with a breastfeed at the time of vaccination. On the contrary, IgA seroconversion in infants immediately breastfed tended to be higher than in those withheld from a feeding.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), a surface-anchored trimeric class-I fusion glycoprotein essential for entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing vaccines and therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 spike variants that facilitate virus spread and may affect the efficacy of recently developed vaccines, creates great concern and highlights the importance of identifying antiviral drugs to reduce SARS-CoV-2-related morbidity and mortality. Nitazoxanide, a thiazolide originally developed as an antiprotozoal agent with recognized broad-spectrum antiviral activity in-vitro and in clinical studies, was recently shown to be effective against several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays, we now demonstrate that nitazoxanide interferes with the SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis, hampering its maturation at an endoglycosidase H-sensitive stage, and hindering its fusion activity in human cells. Besides membrane fusion during virus entry, SARS-CoV-2 S-proteins in infected cells can also trigger receptor-dependent formation of syncytia, observed in-vitro and in COVID-19 patients tissues, facilitating viral dissemination between cells and possibly promoting immune evasion. Utilizing two different quantitative cell-cell fusion assays, we show that nitazoxanide is effective in inhibiting syncytia formation mediated by different SARS-CoV-2 spike variants in human lung, liver and intestinal cells.

Approximately half the dose is absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract within minutes of administration, limiting disease-site uptake and contributing to toxicity. Here, we investigated the role of enteric ion channels and their modulation for improved therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects. Methods: Using primary human duodenal organoids (enteroids) as in vitro models of the functional gastrointestinal epithelium, we found that amiloride (epithelial sodium ion channel blocker) and NS-1619 (K+ channel activator) presented significant effects in 223Ra membranal transport. Radioactive drug distribution was evaluated for lead combinations in vivo and in osteosarcoma and prostate cancer models.

Drugs and vaccines against the rotavirus are handicapped, as in all viral diseases, by the rapid mutational changes that take place in the DNA and protein sequences rendering most of these ineffective. As of now only two vaccines are licensed and approved by the WHO (World Health Organization), but display reduced efficiencies in the underdeveloped countries where the disease is more prevalent. We approached this issue by trying to identify regions of surface exposed conserved segments on the surface glycoproteins of the virion, which may then be targeted by specific peptide vaccines. We had developed a bioinformatics protocol for these kinds of problems with reference to the influenza neuraminidase protein, which we have refined and expanded to analyze the rotavirus issue. Results Our analysis of 433 VP7 (Viral Protein 7 from rotavirus) surface protein sequences across 17 subtypes encompassing mammalian hosts using a 20D Graphical Representation and Numerical Characterization method, identified four possible highly conserved peptide segments. Solvent accessibility prediction servers were used to identify that these are predominantly surface situated. These regions analyzed through selected epitope prediction servers for their epitopic properties towards possible T-cell and B-cell activation showed good results as epitopic candidates (only dry lab confirmation). Conclusions The main reasons for the development of alternative vaccine strategies for the rotavirus are the failure of current vaccines and high production costs that inhibit their application in developing countries.

In this regard, in silico vaccine design for rotavirus could be a promising alternative for developing countries due to its efficiency in shortening valuable time and cost. The present study described an epitope-based peptide vaccine design against rotavirus, using a combination of T-cell and B-cell epitope predictions and molecular docking approach. To perform this, sequences of rotavirus VP7 and VP4 proteins were retrieved from the NCBI database and subjected to different bioinformatics tools to predict most immunogenic T-cell and B-cell epitopes.

Materials and Methods The dried and powdered flowers of Achillea kellalensis were extracted with hot water and ethanol 50% (v/v). The cell viability and toxicity of the extracts were evaluated on MA-104 cells using four methods; trypan blue dye, NR, crystal violet and MTT assay. The in vitro anti-rotavirus properties were determined via four different assays, in order to evaluate the direct inhibition and/or the inhibition of viral replication.

This body of work endeavors to illustrate how these two components influence the efficiency of virus infection in in vitro and in vivo systems with an emphasis on characterizing the transduction capacity of a novel entry-targeting glycoprotein. In previous work, the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope glycoprotein (Env) was modified to generate the Sst-RBS glycoprotein. This glycoprotein was created by replacing the wild type (WT) receptor binding site (RBS), located on the surface subunit (SU) of the Env, with the somatostatin peptide hormone sequence SST-14. The modifications resulted in abrogating transduction via the natural MLV receptor and redirecting transduction to a family of five somatostatin receptors (SSTR). I demonstrate that structural characteristics of the Sst-RBS glycoprotein and the intracellular fate of the SSTR receptor influence the infection efficiency of pseudotyped MLV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) based lentiviral (LV) particles. Infection and western blot assays indicate that Sst-RBS retains the structural requirements for mediating levels of transduction that are comparable to WT and approach within 5-fold that of transduction mediated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein when each envelope protein is pseudotyped on MLV particles. To address the contribution of receptor characteristics on infection efficiency, HEK 293 cell lines stably expressing comparable cell surface levels of SSTR-2, SSTR-3 and SSTR-5; which have natural differences in intracellular trafficking; were generated. Infection assays revealed that distinctive SSTR subtype-specific destinations correlated with observable differences in the level of Sst-RBS MLV and LV transduction. Taken together the results of virus binding, internalization kinetics, pH-neutralizing agents, protease inhibitor and penetration assays support that SSTR-5 allows a greater level of transduction because viruses internalized by this subtype are exposed to more permissive intracellular compartments. Specifically, SSTR-5-associated virions are directed to compartments that are more favorable to cytosolic penetration of viral cores than the compartment(s) to which virions bound to subtypes 2 and 3 are directed; possibly due to a more beneficial complement of host cell proteases. These data suggested that receptor characteristics such as the intracellular fate of internalized virusreceptor complexes exert a strong influence on the efficiency of infection. Surprisingly, even though the difference in the in vitro transduction capacity of Sst-RBS and VSV G pseudotyped LV particles was greater than that of the MLV pseudotypes, the difference did not translate to a reduction in in vivo transduction capacity. A pilot study examining the feasibility of in vivo transduction demonstrated proof of principle and identified regions of the murine brain with endogenous surface expression of SSTRs that were as efficiently transduced by Sst-RBS LV as by VSV G LV.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results of virus binding, internalization kinetics, pH-neutralizing agents, protease inhibitor and penetration assays support that SSTR-5 allows a greater level of transduction because viruses internalized by this subtype are exposed to more permissive intracellular compartments."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8230,"details":{"paperId":"dadb34f1819f9b74a438f50b148f81c744fdc963","externalIds":{"MAG":"1967522523","DOI":"10.1271/bbb.90862","CorpusId":"1087715","PubMed":"20208370"},"title":"In Vitro and in Vivo Evaluation of the Efficacy of Bovine Colostrum against Human Rotavirus Infection","abstract":"We found that skimmed and concentrated bovine late colostrum (SCBLC) obtained from normal cows at 6–7 d after parturition exhibited high potency in inhibiting replication of human rotavirus (HRV) in vitro.

We highlight the opportunities for further research in this field to help provide tangible nutrition solutions to support one’s immune system and fight against infections.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review aims to summarize the literature around human milk and infant nutrition inspired ingredients for support against viral infections and the immune system more broadly and believes that the application of these ingredients can span across all life stages and thus apply to both pediatric and adult nutrition."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9398,"details":{"paperId":"80bbcf652e94ce84548963e6d63f072e50d62133","externalIds":{"MAG":"2533743534","PubMedCentral":"5020101","DOI":"10.3389/fphar.2016.00308","CorpusId":"18036162","PubMed":"27679574"},"title":"In vitro Antiviral Activity of Rubia cordifolia Aerial Part Extract against Rotavirus","abstract":"The root of Rubia cordifolia has been used traditionally as a hemostatic agent, while the aerial part of the plant consisting of leaf and stem is known to exhibit anti-diarrheal properties and has been widely used as a remedy in many parts of China. As rotavirus is one of the most commonly associated diarrhea-causing pathogen, this study aims to investigate the anti-rotaviral effect of R. cordifolia aerial part (RCAP). The cytotoxicity of RCAP toward MA-104 cells was evaluated using the WST-8 assay. Colloidal gold method and real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay were used to confirm the findings of the antiviral assay. Then, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining method was subsequently used to investigate the mode of death among the cells. And the representative components of aqueous extract were isolated and identified. It was shown that both the viability of MA-104 cells and the viral load were reduced with increasing concentration of the extract. DAPI staining showed that virus-induced apoptosis was the cause of the low cell viability and viral load, an effect which was accelerated with incubation in the aqueous herbal extract. The major compounds postulated to exhibit this activity were isolated from the aqueous herbal extract and identified to be compounds Xanthopurpurin and Vanillic Acid. This study showed that RCAP extract effectively inhibited rotavirus multiplication by promoting virus-induced apoptosis in MA-104 cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"DAPI staining showed that virus-induced apoptosis was the cause of the low cell viability and viral load, an effect which was accelerated with incubation in the aqueous herbal extract."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8073,"details":{"paperId":"3808d1aaae3a84cf92ab4b7ba7635c63adcbe09b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2986342855","PubMedCentral":"6836419","DOI":"10.1186/s12906-019-2695-1","CorpusId":"207890326","PubMed":"31694638"},"title":"In vitro and in silico anti-dengue activity of compounds obtained from Psidium guajava through bioprospecting","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In vitro evaluation of these compounds showed that three of them (gallic acid, quercetin, and catechin) were promising antivirals as they inhibit the production of infectious viral particles via different experimental strategies, with the best antiviral being cateschin."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3509,"details":{"paperId":"bd66ae419339724911e564029a7505aaffa0f86f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2092028271","DOI":"10.1016/j.virusres.2012.03.004","CorpusId":"5072420","PubMed":"22445690"},"title":"In vitro and in vivo activity of AS101 against West Nile virus (WNV).","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study suggests that AS101 has a potential preventive and therapeutic effect against WNV infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4959,"details":{"paperId":"ac2d5e4667d7521da9796e488bdc8cbeda197073","externalIds":{"MAG":"2963772191","DOI":"10.1080/14786419.2019.1644505","CorpusId":"198497434","PubMed":"31343270"},"title":"In vitro anti-enteroviral activity of stilbenoids isolated from the leaves of Macaranga barteri","abstract":"Abstract The anti-enteroviral activity of three stilbenoids isolated from the leaves of Macaranga barteri was investigated using the cytopathic effect reduction assay.

The evaluation of the cytotoxicity and potential antiviral activity of these extracts were performed by using MTT assay. Results were expressed as 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) and 50% effective (EC50) concentrations, respectively, in order to calculate the selectivity indices (SI=CC50/EC50) of each extract. From the 40 sponge extracts tested, 17 extracts showed antiviral action in different degrees. The results concerning the antiviral activity were obtained by using three different strategies: (1) simultaneous assay, when sponge extracts were added to the cells at the same time of the viruses; (2) pre treatment assay, when sponge extracts were added to the cells 15 h prior to the viruses infection; and (3) post treatment assay, when the viruses were added to the cells and remained during 2 h prior to the addition of sponge extracts. The antiviral assays with HSV-1/KOS and AdV-5 showed more promising results when the pre treatment test was employed. In relation to the RV-SA11 virus, only the simultaneous assay showed antiviral activity.

It is not known whether immunisation can be used to prevent H pylori infection in humans. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of the human immune response on adherence of H pylori to gastric cells. METHODS: Human milk from a woman infected with H pylori and milk from a non-infected woman were each fractionated by chromatography on DEAE cellulose. Bacteria were incubated with either serum, human milk, human milk fractions, or secretory IgA before incubation with Kato III cells (cells from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line). Bacterial adherence to the cells was assessed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Serum from both the H pylori infected and non-infected women killed H pylori. This resulted from the action of complement as heating the serum to 56 degrees C for 30 minutes abolished the bactericidal activity. Immunoglobulin fractions from serum of both infected and non-infected women did not inhibit H pylori adherence to Kato III cells. Human milk from the woman infected with H pylori and from the non-infected woman inhibited binding of H pylori to Kato III cells by 50 to 70%. Secretory IgA isolated from human milk had minimal inhibitory effect on adherence and this was notably less than the inhibitory effect of whole human milk. CONCLUSIONS: Human milk inhibits adherence of H pylori to Kato III cells and this inhibition is independent of whether or not the donor is infected with H pylori.

Breastmilk has been implicated among factors contributing to this lowered oral vaccine efficacy. We conducted in-vitro experiments to investigate the inhibitory effects of maternal antibody and other non-antibody components in breastmilk on rotavirus vaccine strain (Rotarix) multiplication in MA104 cell culture system and assessed associations with in-vivo vaccine seroconversion in vaccinated infants. Methods Breastmilk samples were collected from mothers before routine rotavirus vaccination of their infant at 6 weeks of age. For each sample, whole breastmilk, purified IgA, purified IgG and IgG and IgA depleted breastmilk samples were prepared as exposure preparations. A 96 well microtitre plate was set up for each sample including a control in which only MA104 cells were grown as well as a virus control with MA104 cells and virus only. The outcome of interest was 50% inhibition dilution of each of the exposure preparations calculated as the titer at which 50% of virus dilution was achieved. Samples from 30 women were tested and correlated to vaccine seroconversion status of the infant. HIV status was also correlated to antiviral breastmilk proteins. Results The mean 50% inhibitory dilution titer when whole breastmilk was added to virus infected MA104 cells was 14.3 (95% CI: 7.1, 22.7). Incubation with purified IgG resulted in a mean 50% inhibitory dilution of 5 (95%CI -1.6, 11.6). Incubating with purified IgA resulted in a mean 50% inhibitory dilution of 6.5 (95% CI -0.7, 13.7) and IgG and IgA depleted breastmilk did not yield any inhibition with a titer of 1.06 (95%CI 0.9, 1.2). Higher milk IgA levels contributed to a failure of infants to seroconvert. HIV was also not associated with any antiviral breastmilk proteins. Discussion and conclusion Whole breastmilk and breastmilk purified IgG and IgA fractions showed inhibitory activity against the rotavirus vaccine Rotarix™ whilst IgA and IgG depleted breastmilk with non-antibody breastmilk fraction failed to show any inhibition activity in-vitro. These findings suggest that IgA and IgG may have functional inhibitory properties and indicates a possible mechanism of how mothers in rotavirus endemic areas with high titres of IgA and IgG may inhibit viral multiplication in the infant gut and would potentially contribute to the failure of their infants to serocovert. There was not association of HIV with either lactoferrin, lactadherin or tenascin-C concentrations.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that IgA and IgG may have functional inhibitory properties and indicates a possible mechanism of how mothers in rotavirus endemic areas with high titres of IgG and IgA may inhibit viral multiplication in the infant gut and would potentially contribute to the failure of their infants to serocovert."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":10046,"details":{"paperId":"8780d0aa761c02d180ea580d5a88e9c9fef33cd2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2091817538","DOI":"10.4161/21645515.2014.988553","CorpusId":"207507215","PubMed":"25692974"},"title":"Inactivated human rotavirus vaccine induces heterotypic antibody response: Correction and development of IgG avidity assay","abstract":"To improve lower efficacy among infants in low income countries and the safety (e.g., rare but severe intussusception) of live oral rotavirus vaccines, we have developed CDC-9 strain with G1P[8] specificity as a candidate inactivated rotavirus vaccine (IRV).

These fucosylated glycans are involved in a number of mammalian physiological processes, including adhesion of pathogens and immune responses. ABSTRACT The gastrointestinal microbiota members produce α-l-fucosidases that play key roles in mucosal, human milk, and dietary oligosaccharide assimilation. Here, 36 open reading frames (ORFs) coding for putative α-l-fucosidases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 29 (GH29) were identified through metagenome analysis of breast-fed infant fecal microbiome. Twenty-two of those ORFs showed a complete coding sequence with deduced amino acid sequences displaying the highest degree of identity with α-l-fucosidases from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides caccae, Phocaeicola vulgatus, Phocaeicola dorei, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Streptococcus parasanguinis. Based on sequence homology, 10 α-l-fucosidase genes were selected for substrate specificity characterization. The α-l-fucosidases Fuc18, Fuc19A, Fuc35B, Fuc39, and Fuc1584 showed hydrolytic activity on α1,3/4-linked fucose present in Lewis blood antigens and the human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) 3-fucosyllactose. In addition, Fuc1584 also hydrolyzed fucosyl-α-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (6FN), a component of the core fucosylation of N-glycans. Fuc35A and Fuc193 showed activity on α1,2/3/4/6 linkages from H type-2, Lewis blood antigens, HMOs and 6FN. Fuc30 displayed activity only on α1,6-linked l-fucose, and Fuc5372 showed a preference for α1,2 linkages. Fuc2358 exhibited a broad substrate specificity releasing l-fucose from all the tested free histo-blood group antigens, HMOs, and 6FN. This latest enzyme also displayed activity in glycoconjugates carrying lacto-N-fucopentaose II (Lea) and lacto-N-fucopentaose III (Lex) and in the glycoprotein mucin. Fuc18, Fuc19A, and Fuc39 also removed l-fucose from neoglycoproteins and human α-1 acid glycoprotein. These results give insight into the great diversity of α-l-fucosidases from the infant gut microbiota, thus supporting the hypothesis that fucosylated glycans are crucial for shaping the newborn microbiota composition. IMPORTANCE α-l-Fucosyl residues are frequently present in many relevant glycans, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), and epitopes on cell surface glycoconjugate receptors. These fucosylated glycans are involved in a number of mammalian physiological processes, including adhesion of pathogens and immune responses. The modulation of l-fucose content in such processes may provide new insights and knowledge regarding molecular interactions and may help to devise new therapeutic strategies. Microbial α-l-fucosidases are exoglycosidases that remove α-l-fucosyl residues from free oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates and can be also used in transglycosylation reactions to synthesize oligosaccharides. In this work, α-l-fucosidases from the GH29 family were identified and characterized from the metagenome of fecal samples of breastfed infants. These enzymes showed different substrate specificities toward HMOs, HBGAs, naturally occurring glycoproteins, and neoglycoproteins. These novel glycosidase enzymes from the breast-fed infant gut microbiota, which resulted in a good source of α-l-fucosidases, have great biotechnological potential.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Insight is given into the great diversity of α-l-fucosidases from the infant gut microbiota, thus supporting the hypothesis that fucosylated glycans are crucial for shaping the newborn microbiota composition."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9962,"details":{"paperId":"3941350054729a86a8f1208cd21d1c8b889818bb","externalIds":{"MAG":"2161129645","DOI":"10.3945/ajcn.113.071993","CorpusId":"10241500","PubMed":"24452231"},"title":"Infant formula and infant nutrition: bioactive proteins of human milk and implications for composition of infant formulas.","abstract":"Human milk contains an abundance of biologically active components that are highly likely to contribute to the short- and long-term benefits of breastfeeding. Many of these components are proteins; this article describes some of these proteins, such as α-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, osteopontin, and milk fat globule membrane proteins. The possibility of adding their bovine counterparts to infant formula is discussed as well as the implications for infant health and development. An important consideration when adding bioactive proteins to infant formula is that the total protein content of formula needs to be reduced, because formula-fed infants have significantly higher concentrations of serum amino acids, insulin, and blood urea nitrogen than do breastfed infants. When reducing the protein content of formula, the amino acid composition of the formula protein becomes important because serum concentrations of the essential amino acids should not be lower than those in breastfed infants. Both the supply of essential amino acids and the bioactivities of milk proteins are dependent on their digestibility: some proteins act only in intact form, others act in the form of larger or small peptides formed during digestion, and some are completely digested and serve as a source of amino acids. The purity of the proteins or protein fractions, potential contaminants of the proteins (such as lipopolysaccharide), as well as the degree of heat processing used during their isolation also need to be considered.

Andrographolide (AG) is an anti-inflammatory agent extracted from a traditional Chinese herb andrographis paniculata. Oral AG tablets and pills are clinically applied for treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. However, the low solubility and bioavailability of AG lead to high doses and long-term therapy. Here we developed an andrographolide-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex (AG-β-CD) for inhalation therapy of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. AG-β-CD was identified with X-ray diffraction and FT-IR. Surprisingly, both AG-β-CD and AG showed little in vitro anti-S. aureus activity. However, pulmonary delivery of AG, AG-β-CD, or penicillin had significant anti-S. aureus pneumonia effects. Leukocytes, neutrophils, white blood cells, total proteins, TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κB p65 expression, and bacterial colonies in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were detected. Pulmonary delivery of AG and AG-β-CD led to bacterial inhibition and inflammation alleviation by regulating immune responses, while penicillin only killed bacteria without significant immune regulation. Moreover, the antipneumonia activity of AG-β-CD was much higher than that of AG, probably resulting from locally accelerated AG dissolution due to β-CD inclusion. The aerodynamic diameter of AG-β-CD powders was 2.03 μm, suitable for pulmonary delivery. Inhalable AG-β-CD is a promising antibacterial and anti-inflammatory medicine for the treatment of S. aureus pneumonia by regulating immune responses, and the effect is enhanced by β-CD inclusion.

Screening of drug and natural product collections identified tannic acid as an inhibitor of TMEM16A, with IC50 ∼ 6 µM and ∼100% inhibition at higher concentrations. Tannic acid inhibited CaCCs in multiple cell types but did not affect CFTR Cl− channels.

We sought to determine the role of COXs, PGs, and the signal transduction pathways involved in rotavirus infection to elucidate possible new targets for antiviral therapy. Human intestinal Caco-2 cells were infected with human rotavirus Wa or simian rotavirus SA-11. COX-2 mRNA expression and secreted PGE2 levels were determined at different time points postinfection, and the effect of COX inhibitors on rotavirus infection was studied by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). To reveal the signal transduction pathways involved, the effect of MEK, protein kinase A (PKA), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NF-κB inhibitors on rotavirus infection was analyzed. In infected Caco-2 cells, increased COX-2 mRNA expression and secreted PGE2 levels were detected. Indomethacin (inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2) and specific COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors reduced rotavirus infection by 85 and 50%, respectively, as measured by an IFA. Indomethacin reduced virus infection at a postbinding step early in the infection cycle, inhibiting virus protein synthesis. Indomethacin did not seem to affect viral RNA synthesis. Inhibitors of MEK, PKA, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB decreased rotavirus infection by at least 40%. PGE2 counteracted the effect of the COX and PKA inhibitors but not of the MEK, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB inhibitors.

The purpose of this study was to purify and characterize breast milk mucin and to determine its anti-HIV-1 activity in an HIV inhibition assay. Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography and caesium chloride isopycnic density gradient purification were used to isolate and purify the mucin. Following Western blotting and amino acid analysis, an HIV-1 inhibition assay was carried out to determine the anti-HIV-1 activity of crude breast milk and purified milk mucin (MUC1) by incubating them with HIV-1 prior to infection of the human T lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM SS cells). SDS-PAGE analysis of the mucin, together with its amino acid composition and Western blotting, suggested that this purified mucin from human breast milk was MUC1. The HIV inhibition assay revealed that while the purified milk mucin (MUC1) inhibited the HIV-1 activity by approximately 97%, there was no inhibition of the HIV-1 activity by crude breast milk. Although the reason for this is not clear, it is likely that because the MUC1 in crude milk is enclosed by fat globules, there may not be any physical contact between the mucin and the virus in the crude breast milk.

Interactions of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) play central roles in mediating immune and inflammatory responses. Leukocyte function‐associated antigen (LFA‐1, αLβ2, and CD11a/CD18) and very late antigen (VLA‐4, α4β1, and CD49d/CD29) are members of integrin‐type CAM that are predominantly involved in leukocyte trafficking and extravasation. LFA‐1 is exclusively expressed on leukocytes and interacts with its ligands ICAM‐1, ‐2, and ‐3 to promote a variety of homotypic and heterotypic cell adhesion events required for normal and pathologic functions of the immune systems. VLA‐4 is expressed mainly on lymphocyte, monocytes, and eosinophils, but is not found on neutrophils. VLA‐4 interacts with its ligands VCAM‐1 and fibronectin (FN) CS1 during chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, psoriasis, transplant‐rejection, and allergy. Block‐ade of LFA‐1 and VLA‐4 interactions with their ligands is a potential target for immunosuppression. LFA‐1 and VLA‐4 antagonists (antibodies, peptides, and small molecules) are being developed for controlling inflammation and autoimmune diseases. The therapeutic intervention of mostly mAb‐based has been extensively studied. However, due to the challenging relative efficacy/safety ratio of mAb‐based therapy application, especially in terms of systemic administration and immunogenic potential, strategic alternatives in the forms of peptide, peptide mimetic inhibitors, and small molecule non‐peptide antagonists are being sought. Linear and cyclic peptides derived from the sequences of LFA‐1, ICAM‐1, ICAM‐2, VCAM‐1, and FN C1 have been shown to have inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo. Finally, understanding the mechanism of LFA‐1 and VLA‐4 binding to their ligands has become a fundamental basis in developing therapeutic agents for inflammation and autoimmune diseases. © 2002 John Wiley& Sons, Inc.

Among the many targets of OGT is host cell factor 1 (HCF-1), a transcriptional regulator that is required for transactivation of the immediate-early genes of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HCF-1 is synthesized as a large precursor that is proteolytically cleaved by OGT, which may regulate its biological function. In this study, we tested whether inhibition of the enzymatic activity of OGT with a small molecule inhibitor, OSMI-1, affects initiation of HSV immediate-early gene expression and viral replication. We found that inhibiting OGT's enzymatic activity significantly decreased HSV replication. The major effect of the inhibitor occurred late in the viral replication cycle, when it reduced the levels of late proteins and inhibited capsid formation. However, depleting OGT levels with small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the expression of HSV immediate-early genes, in addition to reducing viral yields. In this study, we identified OGT as a novel cellular factor involved in HSV replication. Our results obtained using a small molecule inhibitor and siRNA depletion suggest that OGT's glycosylation and scaffolding functions play distinct roles in the replication cycle of HSV. IMPORTANCE Antiviral agents can target viral or host gene products essential for viral replication. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is an important cellular enzyme that catalyzes the posttranslational addition of GlcNAc sugar residues to hundreds of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, and this modification regulates their activity and function. Some of the known OGT targets are cellular proteins that are critical for the expression of herpes simplex virus (HSV) genes, suggesting a role for OGT in the replication cycle of HSV. In this study, we found that OGT is required for efficient expression of viral genes and for assembly of new virions. Thus, we identify OGT as a novel host factor involved in the replication of HSV and a potential target for antiviral therapy.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that OGT is required for efficient expression of viral genes and for assembly of new virions, suggesting a role for OGT in the replication cycle of HSV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9768,"details":{"paperId":"638c3c82b559dfe574e445dd8c40ea06ebb762f6","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8402872","DOI":"10.3390/v13081437","CorpusId":"237340614","PubMed":"34452303"},"title":"Inhibition of Orbivirus Replication by Fluvastatin and Identification of the Key Elements of the Mevalonate Pathway Involved","abstract":"Statin derivatives can inhibit the replication of a range of viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV, Hepacivirus), dengue virus (Flavivirus), African swine fever virus (Asfarviridae) and poliovirus (Picornaviridae).

Crystal structures of RPE65 and site-directed mutagenesis reveal aspects of its catalytic mechanism, especially retinyl moiety isomerization, but other aspects remain to be determined. To investigate potential interactions between RPE65 and lipid metabolism enzymes, HEK293-F cells were transfected with expression vectors for visual cycle proteins and co-transfected with either fatty acyl:CoA ligases (ACSLs) 1, 3, or 6 or the SLC27A family fatty acyl-CoA synthase FATP2/SLCA27A2 to test their effect on isomerase activity. These experiments showed that RPE65 activity was reduced by co-expression of ACSLs or FATP2. Surprisingly, however, in attempting to relieve the ACSL-mediated inhibition, we discovered that triacsin C, an inhibitor of ACSLs, also potently inhibited RPE65 isomerase activity in cellulo. We found triacsin C to be a competitive inhibitor of RPE65 (IC50 = 500 nm). We confirmed that triacsin C competes directly with atRE by incubating membranes prepared from chicken RPE65-transfected cells with liposomes containing 0–1 μm atRE. Other inhibitors of ACSLs had modest inhibitory effects compared with triascin C. In conclusion, we have identified an inhibitor of ACSLs as a potent inhibitor of RPE65 that competes with the atRE substrate of RPE65 for binding.

In rotavirus infected piglets mortality can be as high as 60%. Previous research in this laboratory has identified a porcine intestinal GM3 ganglioside receptor that is required for sialic acid-dependent rotavirus recognition of host cells. In addition, we previously demonstrated exogenously added GM3 can competitively inhibit porcine rotavirus binding and infectivity of host cells in vitro. Sialyllactose, the carbohydrate moiety of GM3, is approximately 3 orders of magnitude less effective than GM3 at inhibiting rotavirus binding to cells. Furthermore, production of therapeutic quantities of GM3 ganglioside for use as an oral carbomimetic in swine is cost prohibitive. In an effort to circumvent these problems, a sialyllactose-containing neoglycolipid was synthesized and evaluated for its ability to inhibit rotavirus binding and infectivity of host cells. Sialyllactose was coupled to dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by reductive amination and the product (SLPE) purified by HPLC. Characterization of the product showed a single primulin (lipid) and resorcinol (sialic acid) positive band by thin layer chromatography and quantification of phosphate and sialic acid yielded a 1:1 molar ratio. Mass spectroscopy confirmed a molecular weight coinciding with SLPE. Concentration-dependent binding of rotavirus to SLPE was demonstrated using a thin-layer overlay assay. Using concentrations comparable to GM3, SLPE was also shown to inhibit rotavirus binding to host cells by 80%. Furthermore, SLPE was shown to decrease rotavirus infection of host cells by over 90%. Finally, preliminary results of in vivo animal challenge studies using newborn piglets in their natural environment, demonstrated SLPE afforded complete protection from rotavirus disease. The efficacy of SLPE in inhibiting rotavirus binding and infection in vitro and in vivo, coupled with its relatively low-cost, large-scale production capabilities make SLPE a promising candidate for further exploration as a possible prophylactic or therapeutic nutriceutical for combating rotavirus disease in animals.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of diclofenac on cAMP-activated Cl− secretion, its underlying mechanisms, and possible application in the treatment of cholera. Diclofenac inhibited cAMP-activated Cl− secretion in human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells with IC50 of ∼20 µM. The effect required no cytochrome P450 enzyme-mediated metabolic activation. Interestingly, exposures of T84 cell monolayers to diclofenac, either in apical or basolateral solutions, produced similar degree of inhibitions. Analyses of the apical Cl− current showed that diclofenac reversibly inhibited CFTR Cl− channel activity (IC50∼10 µM) via mechanisms not involving either changes in intracellular cAMP levels or CFTR channel inactivation by AMP-activated protein kinase and protein phosphatase. Of interest, diclofenac had no effect on Na+-K+ ATPases and Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporters, but inhibited cAMP-activated basolateral K+ channels with IC50 of ∼3 µM. In addition, diclofenac suppressed Ca2+-activated Cl− channels, inwardly rectifying Cl− channels, and Ca2+-activated basolateral K+ channels. Furthermore, diclofenac (up to 200 µM; 24 h of treatment) had no effect on cell viability and barrier function in T84 cells.

Intraperitoneal administration of diclofenac (30 mg/kg) reduced both CT and Vibrio cholerae-induced intestinal fluid secretion by ∼70% without affecting intestinal fluid absorption in mice.

Intestinal mucosal IgA responses play a critical role in protective immunity against rotavirus reinfection. Rotaviruses consist of three concentric capsid layers surrounding a genome of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. The outer layer proteins, VP4 and VP7, which are responsible for viral attachment and entry, are targets for protective neutralizing antibodies. However, IgA mAb's directed against the intermediate capsid protein VP6, which do not neutralize the virus, have also been shown to protect mice from rotavirus infection and clear chronic infection in SCID mice. We investigated whether the anti-VP6 IgA (7D9) mAb could inhibit rotavirus replication inside epithelial cells and found that 7D9 acted at an early stage of infection to neutralize rotavirus following antibody lipofection. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the virus-antibody complex. The attachment of 7D9 IgA to VP6 introduces a conformational change in the VP6 trimer, rendering the particle transcriptionally incompetent and preventing the elongation of initiated transcripts.

LDs are polymorphic organelles that store triacylglycerols, cholesterol and cholesterol esters. The neutral fats are derived from palmitoyl-CoA, synthesized via the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. RV-infected cells were treated with chemical inhibitors of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, and the effects on viral replication kinetics were assessed. Treatment with compound C75, an inhibitor of the fatty acid synthase enzyme complex (FASN), reduced RV infectivity 3.2-fold (P = 0.07) and modestly reduced viral RNA synthesis (1.2-fold). Acting earlier in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, TOFA [5-(Tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid] inhibits the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). TOFA reduced the infectivity of progeny RV 31-fold and viral RNA production 6-fold. The effect of TOFA on RV infectivity and RNA replication was dose-dependent, and infectivity was reduced by administering TOFA up to 4 h post-infection. Co-treatment of RV-infected cells with C75 and TOFA synergistically reduced viral infectivity. Knockdown by siRNA of FASN and ACC1 produced findings similar to those observed by inhibiting these proteins with the chemical compounds. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis using a range of approaches uniformly had a more marked impact on viral infectivity than on viral RNA yield, inferring a role for LDs in virus assembly and/or egress.

We assessed whether the neutralizing activity of breast milk could lower the titer of vaccine virus and explain this difference in vitro. Methods: Breast milk samples were collected from mothers who were breast-feeding infants 4 to 29 weeks of age (ie, vaccine eligible age) in India (N = 40), Vietnam (N = 77), South Korea (N = 34), and the United States (N = 51). We examined breast milk for rotavirus-specific IgA and neutralizing activity against 3 rotavirus vaccine strains—RV1, RV5 G1, and 116E using enzyme immunoassays. The inhibitory effect of breast milk on RV1 was further examined by a plaque reduction assay. Findings: Breast milk from Indian women had the highest IgA and neutralizing titers against all 3 vaccine strains, while lower but comparable median IgA and neutralizing titers were detected in breast milk from Korean and Vietnamese women, and the lowest titers were seen in American women. Neutralizing activity was greatest against the 2 vaccine strains of human origin, RV1 and 116E. This neutralizing activity in one half of the breast milk specimens from Indian women could reduce the effective titer of RV1 by ∼2 logs, of 116E by 1.5 logs, and RV5 G1 strain by ∼1 log more than that of breast milk from American women. Interpretation: The lower immunogenicity and efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in poor developing countries could be explained, in part, by higher titers of IgA and neutralizing activity in breast milk consumed by their infants at the time of immunization that could effectively reduce the potency of the vaccine.

Simultaneous inoculation of SA11 with the extract significantly decreased the incidence of diarrhea. In addition, the extract significantly inhibited cytopathic effects and mRNA expression of viral proteins in SA11-infected MA104 cells. Two flavonoid glycosides, quercitrin and rutin, were strongly suggested to be major anti-RV agents in the extract by serial solvent extraction and reversed-phase HPLC-ESI-MS analysis. Our results suggest that the hot-water extract of M. obovata leaves can be used as a medicine or food additive to prevent and ameliorate RV-induced diarrhea in individuals that may have difficulty in benefitting from the RV vaccines.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that the hot-water extract of M. obovata leaves can be used as a medicine or food additive to prevent and ameliorate RV-induced diarrhea in individuals that may have difficulty in benefitting from the RV vaccines."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":10216,"details":{"paperId":"c63ae3949e5f5e4fbd88c094fb9986893735e92f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2010955715","DOI":"10.5851/KOSFA.2007.27.4.538","CorpusId":"84264202"},"title":"Inhibitory Effect on Rotavirus by Exopolysaccharides Extracted from Kefir","abstract":"This study was carried out to investigate the toxicity of exopolysaccharides (EPS) from kefir toward MA104 cells and evaluate the inhibitory effects of kefir EPS on rotavirus infection.

Previous studies have shown that breast-fed children are better protected against symptomatic infections, and that the milk fat globule protein lactadherin might be at least partly responsible for this effect. In vitro studies have shown that human lactadherin, in contrast to the bovine ortholog, could inhibit rotavirus infectivity, and that bovine MUC1 and a commercially available bovine macromolecular whey protein (MMWP) fraction proved to be effective. The present work describes the versatility of MMWP against the infection of 2 human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and FHs 74 Int) by 4 different rotavirus strains (Wa, RRV, YM, RF). Isolation of a protein fraction (CM3Q3) from MMWP that effectively inhibits rotavirus infectivity in vitro is documented. Purification was achieved by monitoring the rotaviral inhibitory activity in fractions obtained from 2 consecutive steps of ion-exchange chromatography. The major component of CM3Q3 was shown to be bovine IgG, and the attenuating capacity of this fraction is most properly linked to this component. The capacity of MMWP, MUC1, lactadherin, and the CM3Q3 fraction to inhibit the infectivity of the murine EMcN rotavirus strain was analyzed in adult BALB/c mice by using 2 different amounts of virus (10 and 100 times more than 50% the viral shedding doses). Only CM3Q3 was able to significantly affect the shedding of rotavirus in the stools of experimentally infected mice when the high viral dose was given. Detection of rotavirus-specific serum antibodies showed that the high dose infected all groups of mice. Experiments with the low dose of virus implied that all the tested milk proteins could affect the viral shedding in stools; in addition, use of MUC1, MMWP, and CM3Q3 prevented the appearance of serum viral antibodies. The advantages of using bovine immunoglobulins to induce passive immunity against rotavirus have been substantially investigated, although studies have mainly focused on the use of derivatives from immunized cows, especially colostrum.

Conjugate vaccines containing bacterial polysaccharides linked to carrier proteins (neoglycoconjugates) have proven successful, but these often contain repeating epitopes and the reducing end of the glycan is less important, unlike typical glycan determinants in eukaryotes, which are shorter in length and may include the reducing end. Here, we have compared the effects of two linkage methods, one that opens the ring at the reducing end of the glycan, and one that leaves the reducing end closed, on the glycan specificity of the vaccine response in rabbits and mice. We immunized rabbits and mice with bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugates of synthetic open- and closed-ring forms (OR versus CR) of a simple tetrasaccharide lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT, Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc), and tested reactivity to the immunogens and several related glycans in both OR and CR versions on glycan microarrays. We found that in rabbits the immune response to the CR conjugate was directed toward the glycan, whereas the OR conjugate elicited antibodies to the reducing end of the glycan and linker region but not specifically to the glycan itself. Unexpectedly, mice did not generate a glycan-specific response to the CR conjugate. Our findings indicate that the reducing end of the sugar is crucial for generation of a glycan-specific response to some eukaryotic vaccine epitopes, and that there are species-specific differences in the ability to make a glycan-specific response to some glycoconjugates.

We performed an integrated analysis of human milk oligosaccharides and fatty acids to explore their associations with milk microbiota. Methods: We studied a sub-sample of 393 mothers in the CHILD birth cohort. Milk was collected at 3–4 months postpartum. Microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene V4 sequencing. Oligosaccharides and fatty acids were analyzed by rapid high-throughput high performance and gas liquid chromatography, respectively. Dimension reduction was performed with principal component analysis for oligosaccharides and fatty acids. Center log-ratio transformation was applied to all three components. Associations between components were assessed using Spearman rank correlation, network visualization, multivariable linear regression, redundancy analysis, and structural equation modeling. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Key covariates were considered, including fucosyltransferase-2 (FUT2) secretor status of mother and infant, method of feeding (direct breastfeeding or pumped breast milk), and maternal fish oil supplement use. Results: Overall, correlations were strongest between milk components of the same type. For example, FUT2-dependent HMOs were positively correlated with each other, and Staphylococcus was negatively correlated with other core taxa. Some associations were also observed between components of different types. Using redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling, the overall milk fatty acid profile was significantly associated with milk microbiota composition. In addition, some individual fatty acids [22:6n3 (docosahexaenoic acid), 22:5n3, 20:5n3, 17:0, 18:0] and oligosaccharides (fucosyl-lacto-N-hexaose, lacto-N-hexaose, lacto-N-fucopentaose I) were associated with microbiota α diversity, while others (C18:0, 3′-sialyllactose, disialyl-lacto-N-tetraose) were associated with overall microbiota composition. Only a few significant associations between individual HMOs and microbiota were observed; notably, among mothers using breast pumps, Bifidobacterium prevalence was associated with lower abundances of disialyl-lacto-N-hexaose. Additionally, among non-secretor mothers, Staphylococcus was positively correlated with sialylated HMOs. Conclusion: Using multiple approaches to integrate and analyse milk microbiota, oligosaccharides, and fatty acids, we observed several associations between different milk components and microbiota, some of which were modified by secretor status and/or breastfeeding practices.

In this study, integrated molecular and bioprocess engineering approaches were used to simplify the production of modular murine polyomavirus capsomeres and VLPs presenting a rotavirus 18 kDa VP8* antigen. A single construct was generated for dual expression of non‐tagged murine polyomavirus capsid protein VP1 and modular VP1 inserted with VP8*, for co‐expression in Escherichia coli. Co‐expressed proteins assembled into pentameric capsomeres in E. coli. A selective salting‐out precipitation and a polishing size exclusion chromatography step allowed the recovery of stable modular capsomeres from cell lysates at high purity, and modular capsomeres were successfully translated into modular VLPs when assembled in vitro.

We have developed an intracellular neutralisation assay to examine how antibodies neutralise rotavirus inside cells, enabling comparison between IgG and IgA isotypes.

This observation was highly dependent on the activity of the cytosolic antibody receptor TRIM21 and was confirmed using an in vivo model of murine rotavirus infection. Furthermore, mice deficient in only IgG and not other antibody isotypes had a serious deficit in intracellular antibody-mediated protection.

Pigs were challenged with virulent Wa (P1A[8],G1) human rotavirus at postinoculation day (PID) 21 (two-dose VLP regimen) or 28 (three-dose VLP regimen). In vivo antigen-activated antibody-secreting cells (ASC) (effector B cells) and in vitro antigen-reactivated ASC (derived from memory B cells) from intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues (duodenum, ileum, mesenteric lymph nodes [MLN], spleen, peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBL], and bone marrow lymphocytes) collected at selected times were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunospot assays. Rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG ASC and memory B-cell responses were detected by PID 21 or 28 in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues after i.n. inoculation with two or three doses of 2/6-VLPs with or without mLT. Greater mean numbers of virus-specific ASC and memory B cells in all tissues prechallenge were induced in pigs inoculated with two doses of SA11 2/6-VLPs plus mLT compared to SA11 2/6-VLPs without mLT. After challenge, anamnestic IgA and IgG ASC and memory B-cell responses were detected in intestinal lymphoid tissues of all VLP-inoculated groups, but serum virus-neutralizing antibody titers were not significantly enhanced compared to the challenged controls.

Recombinant rotavirus-like particles composed of the viral protein 6 (VP6) and VP2 (2/6-VLPs) have been reported to induce protective immunity in mice when administered by the intranasal (i.n.) route. In this study, we show that administration of 2/6-VLPs by the intrarectal (i.r.) route together with either cholera toxin (CT) or a CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide as the adjuvant protects adult mice against RV infection. Moreover, when CT is used, RV shedding in animals immunized by the i.r. route is even reduced in comparison with that in animals immunized by the i.n. route. Humoral and cellular immune responses induced by these immunization protocols were analyzed. We found that although i.r. immunization with 2/6-VLPs induces lower RV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA levels in serum, intestinal anti-RV IgA production is higher in mice immunized by the i.r. route. Cellular immune response has been evaluated by measuring cytokine production by spleen and Peyer's patch cells (PPs) after ex vivo restimulation with RV. Mice immunized by the i.n. and i.r. routes display higher gamma interferon production in spleen and PPs, respectively.

The former is employed by lipophilic drugs and by molecules selectively transported by channels, pumps and carriers present in the plasma membrane. Hydrophilic molecules cannot cross biological membranes. Therefore their transepithelial transport is significantly enhanced if they move through the paracellular pathway.

For infants, it offers optimal nutrients for normal growth, neural development, and protection from harmful microbes. Humans are the only mammals who drink milk throughout their life. Lipids in colostrum originate mostly from milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) droplets extruded from the mammary gland. The MFGM gained much interest as a potential nutraceutical, due to their high phospholipid (PL), ganglioside (GD), and protein contents. In this review, we focused on health effects of MFGM ingredients and dairy food across the life span, especially on neurodevelopment, cardiometabolic health, and frailty in older adults. The MFGM supplements to infants and children reduced gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections and improved neurodevelopment due to the higher content of protein, PL, and GD in MFGM. The MFGM formulas containing PL and GD improved brain myelination and fastened nerve conduction speed, resulting in improved behavioral developments. Administration of MFGM-rich ingredients improved insulin sensitivity and decreased inflammatory markers, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides by lowering intestinal absorption of cholesterol and increasing its fecal excretion. The MFGM supplements, together with exercise, improved ambulatory activities, leg muscle mass, and muscle fiber velocity in older adults. There are great variations in the composition of lipids and proteins in MFGM products, which make comparisons of the different studies impossible. In addition, investigations of the individual MFGM components are required to evaluate their specific effects and molecular mechanisms.

Low-cost bovine-derived products with high Ig content have been developed and are regulated as medical foods.

Well-established applications for use of SBIs include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated enteropathy and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, SBIs and other similar products could potentially become important components of the treatment regimen for other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by aiding in disease control without immunosuppressive side effects. In addition, SBIs may be helpful in conditions associated with the depletion of circulating and luminal Igs and could potentially play an important role in critical care nutrition. The rationale for their use is to facilitate intraluminal microbial antibody coating, an essential process in immune recognition in the gut which is disturbed in these conditions, thereby leading to intestinal inflammation.

Thus, the hypothesis that isoflavones would inhibit RV infection was tested. All isoflavones at SBIF concentrations were tested individually and as a mixture (MIX). Virus infectivity was assessed in MA-104 cells using a focus forming unit assay. Genistin and MIX significantly reduced RV infectivity by 33-62% and 66-74%, respectively, compared with the control and across a wide range of RV concentrations. When tested without genistin, the MIX lost its anti-RV activity, suggesting that genistin is the biologically active isoflavone in our model. In a dose response assay, genistin significantly reduced RV infectivity at a concentration as low as 30 mumol/L. We investigated several possible mechanisms of action. Isoflavones decreased RV infectivity by modulating virion attachment to the host cells and by modulating a postbinding step. Isoflavones did not alter RV triple-layered structure and genistin did not act through inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases and topoisomerase II or by mimicking the effect of estrogens.

METHODS A total of 366 stool specimens were collected from hospitalized children in hospitals in Yunnan Province from September 2010 to December 2013. The genomic RNA electropherotypes and the G genotypes of the rotaviruses were determined. A phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene was performed. Rotavirus isolation was performed, and characterized by plaque, minimum essential medium, and all genes sequence analysis. Quantification of antibodies for inactivated vaccine prepared with ZTR-68 was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microneutralization assay. RESULTS Group A human rotavirus was detected in 177 of 366 (48.4%) stool samples using a colloidal gold device assay. The temporal distribution of rotavirus cases showed significant correlation with the mean air temperature. Rotaviruses were isolated from 13% of the rotavirus-positive samples. The predominant genotype was G1 (43.5%), followed by G3 (21.7%), G9 (17.4%), G2 (4.3%), G4 (8.7%), and mixed (4.3%) among a total of 23 rotavirus isolates. A rotavirus strain was isolated from a rotavirus-positive stool sample of a 4-month-old child in The First People’s Hospital of Zhaotong (2010) for use as a candidate human inactivated rotavirus vaccine strain and for further research, and was designated ZTR-68. The genotype of 11 gene segments of strain ZTR-68 (RVA/Human-wt/CHN/ZTR-68/2010/G1P[8]) was characterized. The genotype constellation of strain ZTR-68 was identified as G1-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1. The VP7 and VP4 genotypes of strain ZTR-68 were similar to Wa-like strains. CONCLUSIONS A high prevalence of the G1, G2, and G3 genotypes was detected from 2010 to 2012. However, a dominant prevalence of the G9 genotype was identified as the cause of gastroenteritis in children in Yunnan, China, in 2013.

ABSTRACT Pathogenic coronaviruses are a major threat to global public health. Here, using a recombinant reporter virus-based compound screening approach, we identified small-molecule inhibitors that potently block the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among them, JIB-04 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with a 50% effective concentration of 695 nM, with a specificity index of greater than 1,000. JIB-04 showed in vitro antiviral activity in multiple cell types, including primary human bronchial epithelial cells, against several DNA and RNA viruses, including porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus. In an in vivo porcine model of coronavirus infection, administration of JIB-04 reduced virus infection and associated tissue pathology, which resulted in improved weight gain and survival. These results highlight the potential utility of JIB-04 as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens. IMPORTANCE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is an ongoing public health disaster worldwide. Although several vaccines are available as a preventive measure and the FDA approval of an orally bioavailable drug is on the horizon, there remains a need for developing antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 that could work on the early course of infection. By using infectious reporter viruses, we screened small-molecule inhibitors for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Among the top hits was JIB-04, a compound previously studied for its anticancer activity. Here, we showed that JIB-04 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 as well as different DNA and RNA viruses. Furthermore, JIB-04 conferred protection in a porcine model of coronavirus infection, although to a lesser extent when given as therapeutic rather than prophylactic doses. Our findings indicate a limited but still promising utility of JIB-04 as an antiviral agent in the combat against COVID-19 and potentially other viral diseases.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"JIB-04 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 as well as different DNA and RNA viruses and conferred protection in a porcine model of coronavirus infection, although to a lesser extent when given as therapeutic rather than prophylactic doses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":844,"details":{"paperId":"d937ece9403dc08606902cc338ba7dddf2ef6ce8","externalIds":{"MAG":"3025328775","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-7091-6553-9_18","CorpusId":"40115780","PubMed":"9015113"},"title":"Jennerian and modified Jennerian approach to vaccination against rotavirus diarrhea using a quadrivalent rhesus rotavirus (RRV) and human-RRV reassortant vaccine.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A modified \"Jennerian\" approach to rotavirus vaccination appears to be quite promising in preventing severe diarrhea in field trials, but if this approach fails to yield an optimal level of protection consistently, additional modified \" Jenkinsian\" strategic approaches are under development that consider not only human rotav virus VP7 but also human rotvirus VP4, the other outer capsid protein."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6444,"details":{"paperId":"d75dd2dd4f072bd974b222e9b292298dc1f7b098","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1126/sciimmunol.abe2942","CorpusId":"237556735","PubMed":"34533978"},"title":"KIR3DS1 directs NK cell–mediated protection against human adenovirus infections","abstract":"Description KIR3DS1+ NK cells execute enhanced killing of adenovirus-infected cells, providing protection against severe infection in immunocompromised hosts. Armor against adenovirus Reactivation of human adenovirus (HAdV) is a major cause of mortality in children and immunocompromised individuals after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Effective therapies for severe HAdV infections are lacking; therefore, new treatment strategies are required. Using a 3D intestinal organoid system, Jung et al. investigated how natural killer (NK) cells recognize and kill HAdV-infected intestinal epithelial cells. HAdV-infected intestinal epithelial cells strongly up-regulated HLA-F, the ligand for activating NK cell receptor KIR3DS1, which enabled enhanced recognition and killing by NK cells. Furthermore, HAdV-infected pediatric allo-HSCT recipients who received KIR3DS1+/HLA-Bw4+ donor cells exhibited protection from severe HAdV infection and faster HAdV clearance. These findings suggest that the KIR3DS1/HLA-F axis is a promising target for treatment of severe HAdV reactivation after allo-HSCT. Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are a major cause for disease in children, in particular after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Currently, effective therapies for HAdV infections in immunocompromised hosts are lacking. To decipher immune recognition of HAdV infection and determine new targets for immune-mediated control, we used an HAdV infection 3D organoid system, based on primary human intestinal epithelial cells. HLA-F, the functional ligand for the activating NK cell receptor KIR3DS1, was strongly up-regulated and enabled enhanced killing of HAdV5-infected cells in organoids by KIR3DS1+ NK cells. In contrast, HLA-A and HLA-B were significantly down-regulated in HAdV5-infected organoids in response to adenoviral E3/glycoprotein19K, consistent with evasion from CD8+ T cells. Immunogenetic analyses in a pediatric allo-HSCT cohort showed a reduced risk to develop severe HAdV disease and faster clearance of HAdV viremia in children receiving KIR3DS1+/HLA-Bw4+ donor cells compared with children receiving non–KIR3DS1+/HLA-Bw4+ cells.

In this study, we found that knockdown of autophagy‐related protein beclin 1 (BCN1) or autophagy‐related protein 7 (ATG7) in immortalized human hepatocytes (IHHs) inhibited HCV growth.

Our objective was to determine whether such an association exists.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn the Southern California Kaiser Permanente Health Care Plan, a large health maintenance organization, from October, 1992, to July, 1999, we retrospectively identified by computerized data and medical charts all children <3 years old with intussusception, and from 1997 to 1999 we independently identified by prospective clinical and laboratory evaluation children <3 years old with rotavirus diarrhea. We compared the epidemiologic characteristics of intussusception and rotavirus infection in our study population and evaluated for the presence of both diseases in individual patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing computerized data we identified 124 cases of intussusception, 101 (81%) of which were confirmed by medical chart and radiologic reviews. The incidences for infants <1 year old and for children <3 years old were 41 (95% confidence interval, 32 to 55) and 17 (95% confidence interval, 13 to 20) per 100,000 child years, respectively. Between November 1997 and July 1999, we identified 470 cases of rotavirus diarrhea and none had intussusception. Although rotavirus diarrhea had a distinct peak incidence between December and February, intussusception had no apparent seasonality.

The proteins has been shown to have a multitude of bioactive effects, including inhibition of inflammatory phospholipases, induction of effero‐ and phagocytosis, prevent rotavirus induced gastroenteritis, and modulate intestinal homeostasis by regulating epithelial cell migration. The level of expression seems to be important in a row of serious pathologies linked to the intestinal epithelial barrier function, vascular‐ and autoimmune disease. This study examines the ability of lactadherin to modulate migration of intestinal epithelium. A cell exclusion assay is used to quantify the ability of human, bovine and murine lactadherin orthologs to affect migration of primary small intestine epithelium cells. Previous reports show that recombinant murine lactadherin stimulate rat small intestine cell migration. The present study could not confirm this. Conversely, 10 μg/ml lactadherin inhibits migration. Therefore, as lactadherins enteroprotective properties is well established using in vivo models we conclude that the protective effects are linked to lactadherins ability operate as an opsonin, or other modulating effects, and not a direct lactadherin‐cell induction of migration. Thus, the molecular mechanism behind the enteroprotective role of lactadherin remains to be established.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The ability of lactadherin to modulate migration of intestinal epithelium is examined to conclude that the protective effects are linked to lactadhers ability operate as an opsonin, or other modulating effects, and not a direct lactADherin‐cell induction of migration."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9320,"details":{"paperId":"4ef09979d8a68d0e8fede5cde80e89e55b58e362","externalIds":{"MAG":"2911050305","PubMedCentral":"6346216","DOI":"10.3389/fmicb.2018.03179","CorpusId":"57574007"},"title":"Lactic Acid Bacteria as a Live Delivery System for the in situ Production of Nanobodies in the Human Gastrointestinal Tract","abstract":"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are among the most widely used microorganisms in food fermentation.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms of efficacy of LGG in an in-vitro model of RV diarrhea in its viable form (LGG) and conditioned medium (mLGG). Methods Ion secretion corresponding to the NSP4 enterotoxic effect, was evaluated by short circuit current (Isc) and the cytotoxic effect by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Ussing chambers, upon exposure to RV in Caco-2 enterocyte monolayers treated or not with living probiotic or its culture supernatant. Mechanisms of enterotoxic and cytotoxic damage were evaluated including oxidative stress measured by reactive oxygen species, apoptosis evaluated by DAPI and nuclear staining, NFkβ immunofluorescence. Results RV induced Isc increase and TEER decrease, respectively indicating ion secretion and epithelial damage, the two established pathways of diarrhea. Both probiotic preparations reduced both diarrheal effects, but their potency was different. Live LGG was equally effective on both enterotoxic and cytotoxic effect whereas mLGG was highly effective on ion secretion and showed minimal protective effects on cytoskeleton, apoptosis and NFkβ. Conclusions LGG counteracts RV-induced diarrhea by inhibiting both cytotoxic and enterotoxic pathogenic mechanisms.

No effective treatment is currently available for malignant ascites. In this study, the effects of lentinan (LNT)-functionalized selenium nanoparticles (Selene) on malignant ascites were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of Selene targeting mitochondria of tumor cells were also investigated. Methods: Selene were synthesized and characterized by TEM, AFM and particle size analysis. The OVCAR-3 and EAC cells induced ascites models were used to evaluate the effects of Selene on malignant ascites. Proteomic analysis, immunofluorescence, TEM and ICP-MS were used to determine the location of Selene in tumor cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS, ATP content, and caspase-1/3 activity were detected to evaluate the effect of Selene on mitochondrial function and cell apoptosis. Immunofluorescence, Co-IP, pull-down, duolink, Western blot, and FPLC were used to investigate the pathway of Selene targeting mitochondria. Results: Selene could effectively inhibit ascites induced by OVCAR-3 and EAC cells. Selene was mainly located in the mitochondria of tumor cells and induced apoptosis of tumor cells. The LNT in Selene was involved in caveolae-mediated endocytosis through the interaction between toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and caveolin 1 (CAV1).

There is growing evidence to suggest that live-attenuated vaccines also provide protection against other infections beyond the vaccine-targeted pathogens. These so called off-target effects of vaccination have been associated with the tuberculosis vaccine Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG), measles, oral polio and recently salmonella vaccines, and are thought to be mediated by modified innate and possibly adaptive immunity. Indeed, rotavirus vaccines have been reported to provide greater than expected reductions in acute gastroenteritis caused by other enteropathogens, that have mostly been attributed to herd protection and prior underestimation of rotavirus disease. Whether rotavirus vaccines also alter the immune system to reduce non targeted gastrointestinal infections has not been studied directly. Here we review the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying off-target effects of vaccines and propose a mechanism by which the live-attenuated neonatal rotavirus vaccine, RV3-BB, could promote protection beyond the targeted pathogen.

Here we describe a bioinformatic approach to predict BCEs on the VP7 outer capsid protein using sequence data alone. We first validated the approach using a previously published dataset of VP7-specific cross-neutralization titers, and found that amino acid changes at predicted BCEs on the VP7 protein allowed for accurate recapitulation of antigenic relationships among the strains. Applying the approach to a dataset of swine RVA sequences identified 9 of the 11 known BCEs previously mapped to swine strains, indicating that epitope prediction can identify sites that are known to drive neutralization escape in vitro. Additional genotype-specific BCEs were also predicted that may be the cause of antigenic differences among strains of RVA on farms and should be targeted for further confirmatory work.

In this work, we further characterized the immunomodulatory activities of L. salivarius strains from wakame-fed pigs by evaluating their ability to modulate TLR3- and TLR4-mediated innate immune responses in PIE cells. Two strains with a remarkable immunomodulatory potential were selected: L. salivarius FFIG35 and FFIG58. Both strains improved IFN-β, IFN-λ and antiviral factors expression in PIE cells after TLR3 activation, which correlated with an enhanced resistance to rotavirus infection. Moreover, a model of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)/rotavirus superinfection in PIE cells was developed. Cells were more susceptible to rotavirus infection when the challenge occurred in conjunction with ETEC compared to the virus alone. However, L. salivarius FFIG35 and FFIG58 maintained their ability to enhance IFN-β, IFN-λ and antiviral factors expression in PIE cells, and to reduce rotavirus replication in the context of superinfection. We also demonstrated that FFIG35 and FFIG58 strains regulated the immune response of PIE cells to rotavirus challenge or ETEC/rotavirus superinfection through the modulation of negative regulators of the TLR signaling pathway. In vivo studies performed in mice models confirmed the ability of L. salivarius FFIG58 to beneficially modulate the innate immune response and protect against ETEC infection. The results of this work contribute to the understanding of beneficial lactobacilli interactions with epithelial cells and allow us to hypothesize that the FFIG35 or FFIG58 strains could be used for the development of highly efficient functional feed to improve immune health status and reduce the severity of intestinal infections and superinfections in weaned piglets.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is hypothesized that the FFIG35 or FFIG58 strains could be used for the development of highly efficient functional feed to improve immune health status and reduce the severity of intestinal infections and superinfections in weaned piglets."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4552,"details":{"paperId":"00b0b018bd8b2341c9312007a9c2af32fa9c46c6","externalIds":{"MAG":"3037913393","DOI":"10.1042/BST20191144","CorpusId":"220259456","PubMed":"32597470"},"title":"Like mother, like microbe: human milk oligosaccharide mediated microbiome symbiosis.","abstract":"Starting shortly after parturition, and continuing throughout our lifetime, the gut microbiota coevolves with our metabolic and neurological programming.

Carbohydrate-specific IgM was absent in cord blood, whereas low cord blood IgG reactivity to glycans was detectable.

As the dying cell is removed from the epithelium, the surrounding cells reorganize to form a multicellular junction (MCJ) that Lm exploits to find its basolateral receptor and invade. By examining individual infected villi using 3D-confocal imaging, we uncovered a novel role for the second major invasin, InlB, during invasion of the intestine. We infected mice intragastrically with isogenic strains of Lm that express or lack InlB and that have a modified InlA capable of binding murine E-cadherin and found that Lm lacking InlB invade the same number of villi but have decreased numbers of bacteria within each infected villus tip. We studied the mechanism of InlB action at the MCJs of polarized MDCK monolayers and find that InlB does not act as an adhesin, but instead accelerates bacterial internalization after attachment. InlB locally activates its receptor, c-Met, and increases endocytosis of junctional components, including E-cadherin. We show that MCJs are naturally more endocytic than other sites of the apical membrane, that endocytosis and Lm invasion of MCJs depends on functional dynamin, and that c-Met activation by soluble InlB or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) increases MCJ endocytosis. Also, in vivo, InlB applied through the intestinal lumen increases endocytosis at the villus tips.

The aim of this study was to generate recombinant monoclonal VHH specific for the two major norovirus (NoV) genogroups (GI and GII) in order to investigate their potential as immunotherapy for the treatment of NoV diarrhea. To accomplish this objective, two llamas were immunized with either GI.1 (Norwalk-1968) or GII.4 (MD2004) VLPs. After immunization, peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected and used to generate two VHH libraries. Using phage display technology, 10 VHH clones specific for GI.1, and 8 specific for GII.4 were selected for further characterization. All VHH recognized conformational epitopes in the P domain of the immunizing VP1 capsid protein, with the exception of one GII.4 VHH that recognized a linear P domain epitope. The GI.1 VHHs were highly specific for the immunizing GI.1 genotype, with only one VHH cross-reacting with GI.3 genotype.

Rotavirus virions are triple-layered particles. The outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7 are highly variable and represent the major neutralizing antigens. The inner capsid protein VP6 is conserved among group A rotaviruses, is highly immunogenic, and is the target antigen of most immunodiagnosis tests. Llama-derived single-chain antibody fragments (VHH) are the smallest molecules with antigen-binding capacity and can therefore be expected to have properties different from conventional antibodies. In this study a library containing the VHH genes of a llama immunized with recombinant inner capsid protein VP6 was generated. Binders directed to VP6, in its native conformation within the viral particle, were selected and characterized. Four selected VHH directed to conformational epitopes of VP6 recognized all human and animal rotavirus strains tested and could be engineered for their use in immunodiagnostic tests for group A rotavirus detection. Three of the four VHH neutralized rotavirus in vivo independently of the strain serotype. Furthermore, this result was confirmed by in vivo partial protection against rotavirus challenge in a neonatal mouse model. The present study demonstrates for the first time a broad neutralization activity of VP6 specific VHH in vitro and in vivo.

To further understand the structure and function of VP4, we have continued studies with these MAbs. Electron microscopic and sucrose gradient analyses of SA11-MAb complexes showed that triple-layered viral particles disassembled following treatment with NP1b MAbs 10G6 and 7G6 but not following treatment with NP1a MAb 9F6, NP2 MAb 2G4, and NP3 MAb 23.

We selected four neutralization escape mutants of SA11 with these VP4 MAbs and characterized them by using plaque reduction neutralization assays, hemagglutination inhibition assays, and an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These analyses support the previous assignment of the NP1a, NP1b, NP2, and NP3 MAbs into separate epitopes and confirmed that the viruses were truly neutralization escape mutants.

To explore the role of organized intestinal lymphoid tissues in infection by and immunity to rotavirus, lymphotoxin alpha-deficient (LTα−/−) mice that lack Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes were orally infected with murine rotavirus. Systemic rotavirus was cleared within 10 days in both LTα−/− and wild-type mice, and both strains developed early and sustained serum antirotavirus antibody responses. However, unlike wild-type mice, which resolved the intestinal infection within 10 days, LTα−/− mice shed fecal virus for approximately 50 days after inoculation. The resolution of fecal virus shedding occurred concurrently with induction of intestinal rotavirus-specific IgA in both mouse strains. Induction of intestinal rotavirus-specific IgA in LTα−/− mice correlated with the (late) appearance of IgA-producing plasma cells in the small intestine. This, together with the absence of rotavirus-specific serum IgA, implies that secretory rotavirus-specific IgA was produced locally. These findings indicate that serum IgG responses are insufficient and imply that local intestinal IgA responses are important for the clearance of rotavirus from intestinal tissues. Furthermore, they show that while LTα-dependent lymphoid tissues are important for the generation of IgA-producing B cells in the intestine, they are not absolutely required in the setting of rotavirus infection. Moreover, the induction of local IgA-producing B cell responses can occur late after infection and in an LTα-independent manner.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that while LTα-dependent lymphoid tissues are important for the generation of IgA-producing B cells in the intestine, they are not absolutely required in the setting of rotavirus infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6161,"details":{"paperId":"25cf251a6e5a5e7f8721579420e79c3422692f9a","externalIds":{"MAG":"1924071596","DOI":"10.1111/1348-0421.12281","CorpusId":"30909437","PubMed":"26138857"},"title":"MA104 Cell line presents characteristics suitable for enterovirus A71 isolation and proliferation","abstract":"Enterovirus A71 (EV‐A71), one of the most important causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children, can lead to severe clinical outcomes, even death.

Morphologic features of binding events observed with this assay were identical to those described in natural infections. Glycoconjugates, Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell fractions, and plasma membrane vesicles (PMVs) were screened for their ability to block binding of sporozoites to MDBK cells. Mucins, MDBK cell fractions, and PMVs exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of sporozoite binding. The major inhibitory fraction from MDBK cells was found to be insoluble in aqueous medium, nonsaponifiable, and lacking carbohydrate moieties, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Its inhibitory effect was resistant to heat, protease digestion, and glycosidase treatment, suggesting that the inhibitory activity is a lipid or a lipid-like component. The inhibitory activity was purified from MDBK cells, and in larger amounts from bovine small intestinal mucosa, by organic solvent extraction, semipreparative high-pressure liquid chromatography, and preparative high-performance thin-layer chromatography. Biochemical analyses, thin-layer chromatography staining techniques, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis were used to partially characterize the purified lipid.

By further examining the underlying mechanism, we found that MLaHA/CS scaffolds could promote the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by upregulating the phosphorylation of the Smad 1/5/9 pathway. When MLaHA/CS scaffolds were implanted into rat calvarial defects, the incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles and lanthanum significantly promoted the new bone regeneration, as revealed by micro-CT assays and histological staining. Our findings suggest that MLaHA/CS shows great potential for use as a cell-free and biocompatible scaffold for bone regeneration.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The MLaHA/CS scaffolds could promote the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by upregulating the phosphorylation of the Smad 1/5/9 pathway and show great potential for use as a cell-free and biocompatible scaffold for bone regeneration."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1101,"details":{"paperId":"77364d326f5a7486a1830c998618d70ff777ad9b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2051594591","DOI":"10.1007/s00330-014-3492-3","CorpusId":"8411034","PubMed":"25432291"},"title":"Magnetic resonance-imaging of the effect of targeted antiangiogenic gene delivery in a melanoma tumour model","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Treatment with targeted gene-delivery therapy can be monitored by MR imaging and DCE and diffusion-weighted imaging are appropriate methods for monitoring this therapy."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1124,"details":{"paperId":"77c8d82878c5d86f6caf84b5ef6c29f7a5e2e9da","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7086648","MAG":"1999282476","DOI":"10.1007/s00431-013-1945-3","CorpusId":"32703163","PubMed":"23361964"},"title":"Major reduction of rotavirus, but not norovirus, gastroenteritis in children seen in hospital after the introduction of RotaTeq vaccine into the National Immunization Programme in Finland","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Study","JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"RV vaccination in NIP has led to a major reduction of hospital admissions and clinic visits due to RVGE, but has had no effect on NVGE, which has become the leading cause of acute GE in children seen in hospital."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4168,"details":{"paperId":"f811e106a01d2f395f266ead8df432614f7e27a0","externalIds":{"MAG":"2174676490","DOI":"10.1037/e545882006-001","CorpusId":"12108719","PubMed":"14627948"},"title":"Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy.","abstract":"Acute gastroenteritis remains a common illness among infants and children throughout the world. Among children in the United States, acute diarrhea accounts for >1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 300 deaths/year. In developing countries, diarrhea is a common cause of mortality among children aged <5 years, with an estimated 2 million deaths annually. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) includes rehydration and maintenance fluids with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), combined with continued age-appropriate nutrition. Although ORT has been instrumental in improving health outcomes among children in developing countries, its use has lagged behind in the United States. This report provides a review of the historical background and physiologic basis for using ORT and provides recommendations for assessing and managing children with acute diarrhea, including those who have become dehydrated. Recent developments in the science of gastroenteritis management have substantially altered case management. Physicians now recognize that zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease, and an ORS of reduced osmolarity (i.e., proportionally reduced concentrations of sodium and glucose) has been developed for global use. The combination of oral rehydration and early nutritional support has proven effective throughout the world in treating acute diarrhea. In 1992, CDC prepared the first national guidelines for managing childhood diarrhea (CDC. The management of acute diarrhea in children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy. MMWR 1992;41[No. RR-16]), and this report updates those recommendations. This report reviews the historical background and scientific basis of ORT and provides a framework for assessing and treating infants and children who have acute diarrhea. The discussion focuses on common clinical scenarios and traditional practices, especially regarding continued feeding. Limitations of ORT, ongoing research in the areas of micronutrient supplements, and functional foods are reviewed as well. These updated recommendations were developed by specialists in managing gastroenteritis, in consultation with CDC and external consultants. Relevant literature was identified through an extensive MEDLINE search by using related terms. Articles were then reviewed for their relevance to pediatric practice, with emphasis on U.S. populations. Unpublished references were sought from the external consultants and other researchers. In the United States, adoption of these updated recommendations could substantially reduce medical costs and childhood hospitalizations and deaths caused by diarrhea.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The historical background and scientific basis of ORT is reviewed and a framework for assessing and treating infants and children who have acute diarrhea is provided, especially regarding continued feeding."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1016,"details":{"paperId":"95c74fd4142ed3b467097f9fac456dc7c090b393","externalIds":{"MAG":"2093284845","DOI":"10.1007/BF01718220","CorpusId":"20602697","PubMed":"8973528"},"title":"Mapping of antigenic sites on the major inner capsid protein of avian rotavirus using anEscherichia coli expression system","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The cDNA encoding the VP6 gene of avian rotavirus PO-13 strain was inserted into the bacterial expression vector pET-3a and the reactivity with antigenic site I- and II-specific MAbs was analyzed by Western blotting."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":545,"details":{"paperId":"56b642d7d62bbf2952e88783a3ab0713cd2d168b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2072748184","DOI":"10.1006/VIRO.1994.1519","CorpusId":"30348289","PubMed":"7522369"},"title":"Mapping the subgroup epitopes of rotavirus protein VP6.","abstract":"VP6, the most abundant protein of rotaviruses, contains epitopes that allow the classification of these viruses into four subgroups (SG), depending on the presence or absence of two epitopes called I and II.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut microbiota, while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects.

The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut microbiota, and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother–infant pairs (n = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5–9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut microbiota, gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation.

This review summarizes current research into the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, with a particular focus on the evidence that maternal antibody (matAb) interference is a contributing factor to this disparity. All RV vaccines currently in use are orally administered, live-attenuated virus vaccines that replicate in the infant gut, which leaves their efficacy potentially impacted by both placentally transferred immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA Abs conferred via breast milk. Observational studies of cohorts in LMICs demonstrated an inverse correlation between matAb titers, both in serum and breast milk, and infant responses to RV vaccination. However, a causal link between maternal humoral immunity and reduced RV vaccine efficacy in infants has yet to be definitively established, partially due to limitations in current animal models of RV disease. The characteristics of Abs mediating interference and the mechanism(s) involved have yet to be determined, and these may differ from mechanisms of matAb interference for parenterally administered vaccines due to the contribution of mucosal immunity conferred via breast milk. Increased vaccine doses and later age of vaccine administration have been strategies applied to overcome matAb interference, but these approaches are difficult to safely implement in the setting of RV vaccination in LMICs. Ultimately, the development of relevant animal models of matAb interference is needed to determine what alternative approaches or vaccine designs can safely and effectively overcome matAb interference of infant RV vaccination.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Current research into the mechanisms behind Rotavirus (RV) vaccine efficacy is summarized, with a particular focus on the evidence that maternal antibody (matAb) interference is a contributing factor to this disparity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2231,"details":{"paperId":"2e09fccdeed518693763d777d3b013b1ee248eaa","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.chom.2022.04.007","CorpusId":"248729985","PubMed":"35550669"},"title":"Maternal immune protection against infectious diseases.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Pre- and postpartum maternal immune factors that protect against infectious agents in offspring and how they may shape the infant's immune landscape over time are reviewed to discuss the influence of maternal immunity on the responsiveness to immunization in early life."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":719,"details":{"paperId":"161633742d147d5218d5c49b05fc55d9a53f61f6","externalIds":{"MAG":"2464032526","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4899-1828-4_63","CorpusId":"26654356","PubMed":"9192047"},"title":"Maternal immunization of pregnant cattle with recombinant VP8* protein of bovine rotavirus elicits neutralizing antibodies to multiple serotypes.

Methods Nitazoxanide is a mild uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, which is modulating the ATP production in cells. ATP is an essential component of viral replication, and we have evaluated the effect of tizoxanide (TIZ), the active circulating metabolite of NTZ, on ATP in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and in MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses. Results TIZ decreased cellular ATP in a dose-dependent manner in MDCK cells and in MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses. Maximum inhibition of ATP in influenza infected or uninfected MDCK cells reached up to 45% after 6 and 24 hours of exposure to 100µM TIZ. The decrease in cellular ATP did not affect cell viability and was reversible after eliminating TIZ from the culture. Conclusion The concentrations of TIZ required to decrease cellular ATP levels were similar to those reported to inhibit replication of influenza A and B viruses in our laboratory.

In comparison, host targeting antivirals (HTAs) target host factors for antiviral treatment. Since host proteins are probably broadly required for various viral infections, HTAs are not only perceived, but also demonstrated to exhibit broad‐spectrum antiviral activities. In addition, host proteins are not under the genetic control of viral genome, and hence HTAs possess much higher genetic barrier to drug resistance as compared with DAAs. In recent years, much progress has been made to the development of HTAs with the approval of chemokine receptor type 5 antagonist maraviroc for human immunodeficiency virus treatment and more in the pipeline for other viral infections.

The emerging viral infections significantly associated with 2019‐nCoV have challenged humanity's survival. Further, there is a constant emergence of new resistant viral strains that demand novel antiviral agents with fewer side effects and cell toxicity. Despite significant progress made in immunization and regenerative medicine, numerous viruses still lack prophylactic vaccines and specific antiviral treatments that are so often influenced by the generation of viral escape mutants. Of importance, medicinal herbs offer a wide variety of therapeutic antiviral chemotypes that can inhibit viral replication by preventing viral adsorption, adhering to cell receptors, inhibiting virus penetration in the host cell, and competing for pathways of activation of intracellular signals. The present review will comprehensively summarize the promising antiviral activities of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules. Furthermore, it will elucidate their mechanism of action and possible implications in the treatment/prevention of viral diseases even when their mechanism of action is not fully understood, which could serve as the base for the future development of novel or complementary antiviral treatments.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The present review will comprehensively summarize the promising antiviral activities of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules and elucidate their mechanism of action and possible implications in the treatment/prevention of viral diseases even when their mechanisms of action are not fully understood."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8818,"details":{"paperId":"f59468d093ca443d5b2c0fd4863fd3f4b002c353","externalIds":{"MAG":"3136582997","DOI":"10.21203/RS.3.RS-251975/V1","CorpusId":"233672145"},"title":"Melatonin Reduces Inflammation in Intestinal Cells, Organoids and Explants","abstract":"\n Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic and recurrent diseases that often occur in young people and place a heavy burden on public health in both developed and developing countries.

To uncover the function of melatonin in IBDs, three intestinal models, including Caco-2 cells, 3D intestinal organoids and intestinal explants, were used. It was found that different concentrations of melatonin could significantly inhibit the expression levels of NFκB in Caco-2 cells, 3D intestinal organoids and intestinal explants.

In addition, we examined effects on the colonic microbiota in the presence or absence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Thus, preterm pigs (n = 112) were fed formula without or with HMO supplementation (5–10) g/L of a mixture of 4 (4-HMO) or >25 HMO (25-HMO) for 5 (Experiment 1 and 2) or 11 days (Experiment 3). Individual HMO were quantified in colon contents and urine using MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry) and HPAEC-PAD (high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection). Microbial colonization was analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene tags. Intestinal permeability was measured by lactulose to mannitol ratio in urine. HMO supplemented to formula were detected in urine and colon contents in preterm piglets after 5 and 11 days in all three experiments. The amount of HMO excreted via the gut or the kidneys showed large individual variations. Microbial diversity in the colon changed from high levels of Firmicutes (dominated by Clostridium) at day 5 (Exp 2) to high levels of Proteobacteria dominated by Helicobacter and Campylobacter at day 11 (Exp 3).

Amiloride analog hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) can inhibit SARS-CoV-1 E. Therefore, we performed molecular docking and dynamics simulations to explore whether amiloride analogs are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 E. To do so, SARS-CoV-1 E and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins were taken as receptors while HMA and 3-amino-5-(azepan-1-yl)-N-(diaminomethylidene)-6-pyrimidin-5-ylpyrazine-2-carboxamide (3A5NP2C) were selected as ligands.

The MFGM inhibits infectivity of rotavirus (RV), activity that has been attributed to its glycoprotein and carbohydrate components. However, previous studies of proteins and oligosaccharides in the MGFM have not accounted for all the bioactivity associated with the complete MFGM. The lipid fraction of the MFGM accounts for half of its composition by weight, and we postulate that this fraction should be tested by itself to determine if it plays a role in antiviral activity. Herein, the anti-RV activity of an organic extract of MFGM was tested. Natural and whey buttermilk powders containing bovine MFGM enriched in polar lipids were prepared by microfiltration and supercritical fluid extraction treatment to reduce the triglyceride content of the powders. Lipid fractions were then extracted from the MFGM using both single- and dual-phase extraction methods. Whole MFGM and organic extracts were screened in MA-104 cells for anti-infective activity against a neuraminidase-sensitive rotavirus using a focus-forming unit assay. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for whole buttermilk and cheese whey MFGM against the rotavirus. In general, buttermilk MFGM exhibited greater RV percentage inhibition than cheese whey MFGM. Organic-soluble anti-RV compounds were identified in bovine MFGM. The most active fraction, isolated by dual-phase extraction and iatrobead chromatography, was free of proteins and highly nonpolar. Further separation of this fraction in a less polar solvent (30:1 chloroform:methanol) resolved at least 5 lipid-containing compounds, which likely contribute to the anti-RV activity associated with bovine MFGM. In summary, lipid components associated with MFGM appear to contribute in large part to the anti-RV activity associated with the bovine MFGM.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6286,"details":{"paperId":"6e1d05e3cf7e9d41d82afee240b03b18cf93e37e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2028003913","DOI":"10.1111/J.1471-0307.2011.00759.X","CorpusId":"84454330"},"title":"Milk fat globule membrane – a source of polar lipids for colon health?

Attachment to the host receptor is a crucial step for virus replication. The VP8* domain is the distal terminal region of the RVA spike protein VP4 (expressed by the P gene) and is important for rotavirus binding and infectivity. Recent studies have indicated a role for non-sialylated glycans, including mucin core 2 and histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), in the infectivity of human and animal group A rotaviruses. In the present study, we determined if porcine rotavirus-derived recombinant VP8* of the endemic strains 14R103 G5P[6], 13R054 G5P[7], 12R010 G4P[13], 12R046 G9P[23], and 12R022 G2P[27] interact with hitherto uncharacterized glycans.

The hemagglutination assay showed genotypes P[7] and P[23] hemagglutinate porcine and human red blood cells. In an array screen of > 300 glycans, recombinant VP8* of rotavirus genotype P[6], P[7], and P[13] showed specific binding to glycans with a Gal-β-1,4-Glc (β-lactose) motif, which forms the core structure of HBGAs. The specificity of glycan-binding was confirmed through an ELISA-based oligosaccharide binding assay. Further, 13R054 G5P[7] and 12R046 G9P[23] infectivity was significantly reduced by β-lactose in MA104 cells and primary porcine enterocytes.

Some studies indicate that mimosine prevents the initiation of DNA replication, whereas other studies indicate that mimosine disrupts elongation of the replication fork by impairing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and the transcription of the cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene (SHMT1). In this study, the mechanism for mimosine-induced inhibition of SHMT1 transcription was elucidated. A mimosine-responsive transcriptional element was localized within the first 50 base pairs of the human SHMT1 promoter by deletion analyses and gel mobility shift assays. The 50-base-pair sequence contains a consensus zinc-sensing metal regulatory element (MRE) at position -44 to -38, and mutation of the MRE attenuated mimosine-induced transcription repression. Mimosine treatment eliminated MRE- and Sp1-binding activity in nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells but not in nuclear extracts from a mimosine-resistant cell line, MCF-7/2a. MCF-7 cells cultured in zinc-depleted medium for more than 16 days were viable and lacked cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase protein, confirming that mimosine inhibits SHMT1 transcription by chelating zinc. The disruption of DNA-protein interactions by zinc chelation provides a general mechanism for the inhibitory effects of mimosine on nuclear processes, including replication and transcription.

Here we demonstrate that it is possible to synthesize thiol-protected gold nanoparticles over VP6 nanotubes, which resulted in soluble nanobiomaterials. With this strategy, it was possible to modulate the size, colloidal stability, and surface plasmon resonance of the synthesized nanoparticles by controlling the content of the thiolated ligands.

To investigate the underlying molecular basis, we determined the crystal structures of d-sialic acid aldolase and RS-aldolase. All mutations are away from the catalytic center, except for V251I, which is near the opening of the (α/β)8-barrel and proximal to the Schiff base-forming Lys-165. The change of specificity from d-sialic acid to RS-aldolase can be attributed mainly to the V251I substitution, which creates a narrower sugar-binding pocket, but without altering the chirality in the reaction center. The crystal structures of d-sialic acid aldolase·l-arabinose and RS-aldolase·hydroxypyruvate complexes and five mutants (V251I, V251L, V251R, V251W, and V251I/V265I) of the d-sialic acid aldolase were also determined, revealing the location of substrate molecules and how the contour of the active site pocket was shaped.

The application of antibiotics also has many other side effects like, intestinal barrier dysfunction, antibiotics residues in foodstuffs, nephropathy, allergy, bone marrow toxicity, mutagenicity, reproductive disorders, hepatotoxicity carcinogenicity, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which greatly compromise the efficacy of antibiotics. Thus, the development of new antibiotics is necessary, while the search for antibiotic alternatives continues.

Hence, the adverse effects of antibiotics and remedial effects of probiotics during infectious diseases have become central points of focus among researchers. Probiotics are live microorganisms, and when given in adequate quantities, confer good health effects to the host through different mechanisms. Among them, the regulation of host immune response during pathogenic infections is one of the most important mechanisms. A number of studies have investigated different aspects of probiotics.

We reconstituted the complete 14-subunit BoNT/A complex using recombinantly produced components and demonstrated that abolishing either E-cadherin– or carbohydrate-binding of the HA complex drastically reduces oral toxicity of BoNT/A complex in vivo.

In addition to providing a source of nutrition, breast milk contains a diverse array of microbiota and myriad biologically active components that are thought to guide the infant’s developing mucosal immune system. It is believed that bacteria from the mother’s intestine may translocate to breast milk and dynamically transfer to the infant. Such interplay between mother and her infant is a key to establishing a healthy infant intestinal microbiome. These intestinal bacteria protect against many respiratory and diarrheal illnesses, but are subject to environmental stresses such as antibiotic use. Orchestrating the development of the microbiota are the human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), the synthesis of which are partially determined by the maternal genotype. HMOs are thought to play a role in preventing pathogenic bacterial adhesion though multiple mechanisms, while also providing nutrition for the microbiome. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, carry a diverse cargo, including mRNA, miRNA, and cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins, and are readily detectable in human breast milk.

Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) is a simian RV that was previously used as a human RV vaccine and has been extensively studied in mice. Although RRV replicates poorly in the suckling mouse intestine, infection induces a robust and protective antibody response. The recent availability of plasmid-based RV reverse genetics systems has enabled the generation of recombinant RVs expressing foreign proteins. However, recombinant RVs have not yet been experimentally tested as potential vaccine vectors to immunize against other gastrointestinal pathogens in vivo. This is a missed opportunity because several live-attenuated RV vaccines are already widely administered to infants and young children worldwide. To explore the feasibility of using RV as a dual vaccine vector, we rescued a replication-competent recombinant RRV harboring bicistronic gene segment 7 that encodes both the native RV NSP3 protein and a human norovirus (HuNoV) VP1 protein from the predominant genotype GII.4 (rRRV-HuNoV-VP1). The rRRV-HuNoV-VP1 expressed HuNoV VP1 in infected cells in vitro and importantly, elicited both systemic and local antibody responses to HuNoV following oral infection of suckling mice. Serum IgG and fecal IgA from infected suckling mice bound to and neutralized both RV and HuNoV. These findings have encouraging practical implications for the design of RV-based next-generation multivalent enteric vaccines to target HuNoV and other human enteric pathogens while providing immunity to RV. Significance statement Mucosal immunity is a key component of protection against many pathogens. Robust and effective mucosal immune responses are generally induced following infection with a replication-competent pathogen at a mucosal surface. Several studies have attempted to develop viral vector-based enteric mucosal vaccines; however, the most advanced of these are still in clinical development. Here, we successfully induced systemic and mucosal antibody responses against both rotavirus and norovirus following inoculation of a recombinant rotavirus expressing the human norovirus major capsid protein. These responses are likely to correlate with protective immunity. Live-attenuated rotavirus vaccines have already proven safe and effective worldwide.

Simply characterizing the concentrations of these bioactives, however, provides only limited information regarding their potential relationships with disease risk in the recipient infant. Rather, understanding pathogen and antigen specificity profiles of milk-borne immunoglobulins might lead to a more complete understanding of how maternal immunity impacts infant health and wellbeing. Milk produced by women living in 11 geographically dispersed populations was applied to a protein microarray containing antigens from 16 pathogens, including diarrheagenic E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogens of global health concern, and specific IgA and IgG binding was measured. Our analysis identified novel disease-specific antigen responses and suggests that some IgA and IgG responses vary substantially within and among populations. Patterns of antibody reactivity analyzed by principal component analysis and differential reactivity analysis were associated with either lower-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) or high-income countries (HICs). Antibody levels were generally higher in LMICs than HICs, particularly for Shigella and diarrheagenic E. coli antigens, although sets of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and some M. tuberculosis antigens were more reactive in HICs. Differential responses were typically specific to canonical immunodominant antigens, but a set of nondifferential but highly reactive antibodies were specific to antigens possibly universally recognized by antibodies in human milk.

ABSTRACT Rotavirus is the leading global cause of diarrheal mortality for unvaccinated children under 5 years of age. The outer capsid of rotavirus virions consists of VP7 and VP4 proteins, which determine viral G and P types, respectively, and are primary targets of neutralizing antibodies. Successful vaccination depends upon generating broadly protective immune responses following exposure to rotaviruses presenting a limited number of G- and P-type antigens. Vaccine introduction resulted in decreased rotavirus disease burden but also coincided with the emergence of uncommon G and P genotypes, including G12. To gain insight into the recent predominance of G12P[8] rotaviruses in the United States, we evaluated 142 complete rotavirus genome sequences and metadata from 151 clinical specimens collected in Nashville, TN, from 2011 to 2013 through the New Vaccine Surveillance Network. Circulating G12P[8] strains were found to share many segments with other locally circulating strains but to have distinct constellations. Phylogenetic analyses of G12 sequences and their geographic sources provided evidence for multiple separate introductions of G12 segments into Nashville, TN. Antigenic epitopes of VP7 proteins of G12P[8] strains circulating in Nashville, TN, differ markedly from those of vaccine strains. Fully vaccinated children were found to be infected with G12P[8] strains more frequently than with other rotavirus genotypes. Multiple introductions and significant antigenic mismatch may in part explain the recent predominance of G12P[8] strains in the United States and emphasize the need for continued monitoring of rotavirus vaccine efficacy against emerging rotavirus genotypes.

Conclusion: Exogenous forms of recombinant SP-D can rescue mice from a lethal challenge with influenza. Significance: It may be possible to develop collectin-based interventions for influenza. The recognition of influenza A virus (IAV) by surfactant protein D (SP-D) is mediated by interactions between the SP-D carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) and glycans displayed on envelope glycoproteins. Although native human SP-D shows potent antiviral and aggregating activity, trimeric recombinant neck+CRDs (NCRDs) show little or no capacity to influence IAV infection. A mutant trimeric NCRD, D325A/R343V, showed marked hemagglutination inhibition and viral neutralization, with viral aggregation and aggregation-dependent viral uptake by neutrophils. D325A/R343V exhibited glucose-sensitive binding to Phil82 hemagglutinin trimer (HA) by surface plasmon resonance. By contrast, there was very low binding to the HA trimer from another virus (PR8) that lacks glycans on the HA head. Mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of high mannose glycans on the Phil82 HA at positions known to contribute to IAV binding. Molecular modeling predicted an enhanced capacity for bridging interactions between HA glycans and D325A/R343V.

Viral load and virus fitness are known to influence virus extinction. Here we examine the effect or the multiplicity of infection (MOI) on progeny production of several RNA viruses under enhanced mutagenesis. Results The effect of the mutagenic base analogue 5-fluorouracil (FU) on the replication of the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can result either in inhibition of progeny production and virus extinction in infections carried out at low multiplicity of infection (MOI), or in a moderate titer decrease without extinction at high MOI. The effect of the MOI is similar for LCMV and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), but minimal or absent for the picornaviruses foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The increase in mutation frequency and Shannon entropy (mutant spectrum complexity) as a result of virus passage in the presence of FU was more accentuated at low MOI for LCMV and VSV, and at high MOI for FMDV and EMCV. We present an extension of the lethal defection model that agrees with the experimental results. Conclusions (i) Low infecting load favoured the extinction of negative strand viruses, LCMV or VSV, with an increase of mutant spectrum complexity. (ii) This behaviour is not observed in RNA positive strand viruses, FMDV or EMCV. (iii) The accumulation of defector genomes may underlie the MOI-dependent behaviour.

We took the approach of repositioning approved drugs for anti-dengue virus activity by screening a library of pharmacologically active compounds. We identified N-desmethylclozapine, fluoxetine hydrochloride, and salmeterol xinafoate as dengue virus inhibitors based on reductions in the numbers of infected cells and viral titers. Dengue virus RNA levels were diminished in inhibitor-treated cells, and this effect was specific to dengue virus, as other flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, or other RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus, were not affected by these inhibitors. All three inhibitors specifically inhibited dengue virus replication with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the high-nanomolar range. Estimation of negative-strand RNA intermediates and time-of-addition experiments indicated that inhibition was occurring at a postentry stage, most probably at the initiation of viral RNA replication.

Infants that are not breastfed have a greater incidence of severe diarrhea and respiratory diseases than those who are breastfed. In the past, this had been attributed primarily to human milk secretory antibodies. However, the oligosaccharides are major components of human milk, and milk is also rich in other glycans, including glycoproteins, mucins, glycosaminoglycans, and glycolipids. These milk glycans, especially the oligosaccharides, are composed of thousands of components. The milk factor that promotes gut colonization by Bifidobacterium bifidum was found to be a glycan, and such prebiotic characteristics may contribute to protection against infectious agents. However, the ability of human milk glycans to protect the neonate seems primarily to be due to their inhibition of pathogen binding to their host cell target ligands. Many such examples include specific fucosylated oligosaccharides and glycans that inhibit specific pathogens. Most human milk oligosaccharides are fucosylated, and their production depends on fucosyltransferase enzymes; mutations in these fucosyltransferase genes are common and underlie the various Lewis blood types in humans. Variable expression of specific fucosylated oligosaccharides in milk, also a function of these genes (and maternal Lewis blood type), is significantly associated with the risk of infectious disease in breastfed infants. Human milk also contains major quantities and large numbers of sialylated oligosaccharides, many of which are also present in bovine colostrum. These could similarly inhibit several common viral pathogens. Moreover, human milk oligosaccharides strongly attenuate inflammatory processes in the intestinal mucosa. These results support the hypothesis that oligosaccharides and other glycans are the major constituents of an innate immune system of human milk whereby the mother protects her infant from enteric and other pathogens through breastfeeding. These protective glycans may prove useful as a basis for the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic agents that inhibit disease by mucosal pathogens in many species.","publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The hypothesis that oligosaccharides and other glycans are the major constituents of an innate immune system of human milk whereby the mother protects her infant from enteric and other pathogens through breastfeeding is supported."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7832,"details":{"paperId":"dd3f68fc575dac28730aedfea07338d7fe8c8ace","externalIds":{"MAG":"3046215361","PubMedCentral":"7414372","DOI":"10.1155/2020/2957567","CorpusId":"221115831","PubMed":"32802121"},"title":"Network Pharmacology-Based Strategy for Predicting Active Ingredients and Potential Targets of Gegen Qinlian Decoction for Rotavirus Enteritis","abstract":"Materials and Methods In this study, a network pharmacology-based strategy was used to elucidate the mechanism of GGQLD for the treatment of RVE.

In China, Huiyangjiuji decoction (HYJJ) has been widely administered against inflammation, but the underlying mechanical mechanisms are not known. A murine model of colitis was established by orally feeding 4% dextran sodium sulfate for 5 days. Intestinal organoids (IOs) were treated with TNFα (Tumor necrosis factor-α) as an ex-vivo UC model. A scratch assay combined with a co-culture system that incubated murine epithelial cell line (IEC-6) with macrophages (Mφs) was utilized to assess epithelial recovery under inflammatory conditions. Network pharmacology analysis was performed to elucidate the mechanism of HYJJ decoction. In the present study, we confirmed that HYJJ considerably alleviated of DSS-induced colitis, as evidenced by the improved intestinal injury and fecal albumin, as well as feces blood. Network pharmacology analysis identified the active components in HYJJ formula, and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that HYJJ-target genes were enriched in pathogen-induced infections, cancer-related as well as inflammatory pathways. Consistently, RNA-sequencing demonstrated that HYJJ treated inhibited cytokine-cytokine interaction, IBD as well as TNF signaling pathways, confirming the anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic role of HYJJ decoction. In-vitro experimental evidence confirmed the suppression of pro-interleukins by HYJJ, including IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12. Moreover, the contribution of HYJJ to mucosal healing was corroborated by ex-vivo experiments, in which HYJJ rescued TNFα-compromised IOs functions, i.e., elevated mitochondrial stress (MOS) and impaired regeneration capacity. IEC-6 cells co-culture with Mφs from HYJJ-treated experimental colitis mice showed an improved migration capacity as compared to those incubated with Mφs from untreated colitis mice.

Methods The cytopathic effect inhibition assay with different concentrations of puerarin at different times of infection in vitro was applied to evaluate the effect of puerarin against human RV G1P[8] Wa strain (HRV Wa). Subsequently, the potential targets of puerarin and RV-related genes were obtained from online databases. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of the major target genes were also performed. Furthermore, the major targets and signaling pathway related to RV infection were verified at the molecular level via Western blot, quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. Results Our results suggest that puerarin had a certain inhibitory effect on viral replication and proliferation. The network pharmacology analysis showed that a total of 436 puerarin corresponding target and 497 RV-related targets were acquired from the online databases. The core targets of puerarin against RV, such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and caspase 3 (CASP3), were identified from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The KEGG analysis indicated that the TLR signaling pathway was one of the crucial mechanisms of puerarin against RV. In particular, puerarin could inhibit the expression of key factors of the TLR4/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in HRV-infected Caco-2 cells and regulate the levels of cellular inflammatory factors. Conclusions Based on the network pharmacology analysis and experimental study, the study showed that puerarin not only had an anti-RV effect, but could also modulate the inflammatory response induced by RV infection via the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Total IgA concentrations and anti-rotavirus SIgA levels were measured in samples collected from three mothers during 90 or 240 days of the lactation period. Results: Colostrum samples showed higher levels of anti-rotavirus SIgA and higher neutralizing ability than in milk. However, these antibodies levels were not statistically different. In addition, there was no correlation between antibody levels and the neutralizing activity observed in colostrum and milk samples. Follow-up of three mothers demonstrated the persistence of anti-rotavirus and total IgA levels throughout lactation.

In addition, these bacteria generate metabolites such as butyrate, desaminotyrosine, and secondary bile acid, suggested to prevent viral respiratory infections. Gut microbial metabolites transported via the circulation to the lungs could inhibit viral replication or improve the immune response against viruses.

Although norovirus gastroenteritis is self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, chronic infections with debilitating and life-threatening complications occur in immunocompromised patients. ABSTRACT Norovirus is the main cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. Although norovirus gastroenteritis is self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, chronic infections with debilitating and life-threatening complications occur in immunocompromised patients. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) has been used empirically in the clinic and has demonstrated effectiveness against norovirus gastroenteritis. In this study, we aimed at uncovering the antiviral potential and mechanisms of action of NTZ and its active metabolite, tizoxanide (TIZ), using a human norovirus (HuNV) replicon. NTZ and TIZ, collectively referred to as thiazolides (TZD), potently inhibited replication of HuNV and a norovirus surrogate, feline calicivirus. Mechanistic studies revealed that TZD activated cellular antiviral response and stimulated the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), particularly interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), not only in a Huh7 cell-based HuNV replicon, but also in naive Huh7 and Caco-2 cells and novel human intestinal organoids. Overexpression of exogenous IRF-1 inhibited HuNV replication, whereas knockdown of IRF-1 largely attenuated the antiviral activity of TZD, suggesting that IRF-1 mediated TZD inhibition of HuNV. By using a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, CP-690550, and a STAT1 knockout approach, we found that TZD induced antiviral response independently of the classical JAK-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Furthermore, TZD and ribavirin synergized to inhibit HuNV replication and completely depleted the replicons from host cells after long-term treatment. In summary, our results demonstrated that TZD combated HuNV replication through activation of cellular antiviral response, in particular by inducing a prominent antiviral effector, IRF-1. NTZ monotherapy or combination with ribavirin represent promising options for treating norovirus gastroenteritis, especially in immunocompromised patients.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that NTZ monotherapy or combination with ribavirin represent promising options for treating norovirus gastroenteritis, especially in immunocompromised patients."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7876,"details":{"paperId":"4b61f816a409f980322c0847cd9be48b8e76ed79","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4327329","MAG":"2068692687","DOI":"10.1159/000375116","CorpusId":"7265860","PubMed":"25759631"},"title":"Nitazoxanide Use as Part of an Empiric Multi-Drug Regimen in Treating Children with Suspected Helicobacter pylori Infection","abstract":"Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium found in the human stomach, is often present in patients with chronic gastritis.

Nitazoxanide is an antimicrobial that has been shown to be effective against a broad range of enteropathogens. To date, its use has not been reported in the tropical Top End (northernmost part) of the Northern Territory, Australia. The objective was to describe the use of nitazoxanide at the Royal Darwin Hospital, Northern Territory, and to assess any association with the time to resolution of diarrhoea.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEligible children (≤13 years) were identified from dispensary records as having been prescribed nitazoxanide during the audit period, 1 July 2007 to 31 March 2012. Patient demographics, symptoms, diarrheal aetiology, treatment details and clinical outcomes were obtained by chart review.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-eight children were treated with nitazoxanide, mostly for Cryptosporidium infection associated with prolonged diarrhoea. Dehydration was evident in 27 (96%) children on admission, and 11 (41%) were underweight. Diarrhoeal duration prior to treatment was 11.5 days (6.5 days pre- and 5 days post-admission). For children ≥12 months, nitazoxanide was prescribed according to guidelines stipulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Resolution of diarrhoea occurred a median of 2.4 days (IQR: 1.4-7.3) after starting treatment. An increase in weight for length at discharge was found for all children.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrompt resolution of diarrhoea without adverse outcomes suggests nitazoxanide may be an effective treatment for Cryptosporidium infection in this setting. Its role in the treatment of other causes of infectious diarrhoea needs further investigation. Randomised trials will further direct its use and determine optimal dosing regimens.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2535,"details":{"paperId":"50400fe378c8b060c219e0a503d48f5855fbf9d4","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.jct.2022.106928","CorpusId":"252584747"},"title":"Nitazoxanide in aqueous co-solvent solutions of isopropanol/DMF/NMP: Solubility, solvation thermodynamics and intermolecular interactions","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3084,"details":{"paperId":"f440eb4dbac5178047da1cb1713764997b756b49","externalIds":{"MAG":"1965677488","DOI":"10.1016/J.TRSTMH.2007.04.001","CorpusId":"42570927","PubMed":"17658567"},"title":"Nitazoxanide in the treatment of amoebiasis.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Nitazoxanide is effective in treating invasive intestinal amoebiasis and in eliminating E. histolytica colonisation of the intestinal tract."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6230,"details":{"paperId":"26ed7c9044c21c39386c5e9c3d497e6405e3ef50","externalIds":{"MAG":"2149272038","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03128.x","CorpusId":"23600568","PubMed":"17081163"},"title":"Nitazoxanide in the treatment of viral gastroenteritis: a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled clinical trial","abstract":"Enteric viruses including noroviruses and rotavirus are leading causes of diarrhoeal disease and gastroenteritis worldwide, and there is no effective treatment.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","ClinicalTrial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Enteric viruses including noroviruses and rotavirus are leading causes of diarrhoeal disease and gastroenteritis worldwide, and there is no effective treatment."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4389,"details":{"paperId":"6f36fe30b11dc4b41e39e812bec49f3dab30d699","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-28172-9","CorpusId":"256954288"},"title":"Nitazoxanide inhibits paramyxovirus replication by targeting the Fusion protein folding: role of glycoprotein-specific thiol oxidoreductase ERp57","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Nitazoxanide is used in the clinic as a safe and effective antiprotozoal/antimicrobial drug; its antiviral activity was shown in patients infected with hepatitis-C virus, rotavirus and influenza viruses, and the results now suggest that nitaz oxanide may be effective also against paramyxovirus infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8001,"details":{"paperId":"fc3fea88dc84f26078665194760d08a5770da829","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1186/1743-422X-11-10","CorpusId":"255956216"},"title":"Nitazoxanide inhibits the replication of Japanese encephalitis virus in cultured cells and in a mouse model","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Both in vitro and in vivo data indicated that NTZ has anti-JEV activity, suggesting the potential application of NTZ in the treatment of Japanese encephalitis."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1425,"details":{"paperId":"3dd28a44b689149cc5009ca3f8f448c3e21e0d1e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2060737659","DOI":"10.1007/s12098-010-0268-x","CorpusId":"207385833","PubMed":"20949335"},"title":"Nitazoxanide use in Rota Viral Diarrhea.

Effective vaccines against noroviruses are not yet available, enhancing the interest of the protection mechanisms elicited by breast milk that may contain norovirus-specific antibodies and histo-blood group antigens. The aims of our study were to analyze norovirus GII.4-specific antibodies in breast milk and serum and to assess their blocking activity on recombinant norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) binding to saliva. Methods: Mature milk and serum from 108 mothers were analyzed for specific IgA to norovirus GII.4-2006b and for their blocking activity on the binding of norovirus GII.4-2006b VLPs to fucosyltransferase FUT2-positive and negative saliva. Norovirus GII.4-2006b-specific IgG antibodies were also analyzed in serum samples. Results: Higher specific IgA titers were detected in mature milk (75%) than in serum samples (62%), showing a correlation between both results (&rgr; = 0.427, P = 0.000). However, only 56.3% of the serum samples contained norovirus-specific IgG. Almost all mature milk samples (99.1%) inhibited the binding of norovirus VLPs to FUT2-negative saliva; however, only 25% did so to FUT2-positive saliva (P = 0.000). Ninety percent of serum samples inhibited the binding of norovirus VLPs to FUT2-negative saliva. Conclusions: Breast milk inhibits norovirus GII.4-2006b VLPs binding to receptors in saliva, and anti-norovirus IgA antibodies are only partly responsible for this activity.

This P particle is easily produced in Escherichia coli, extremely stable, and highly immunogenic. There are three surface loops per P domain, making a total of 72 loops per particle, and these are potential sites for foreign antigen presentation for immune enhancement. To prove this concept, a small peptide (His tag, 7 amino acids [aa]) and a large antigen (rotavirus VP8, 159 aa) were inserted into one of the loops. Neither insertion affects P particle formation, while both antigens were presented well on the P particle surface. The immune-enhancement effect of the P particle was demonstrated by significantly increased antibody titers induced by the P particle-presented antigens compared to the titers induced by free antigens. In addition, the measured neutralization antibody titers and levels of protection against rotavirus shedding in mice immunized with the VP8 chimeric P particles were significantly higher than those of mice immunized with the free VP8 antigen. Sera from P particle-VP8 chimera-vaccinated animals also blocked norovirus virus-like particle (VLP) binding to the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) receptors. From these data, the P particle appears to be an excellent vaccine platform for antigen presentation. The readily available three surface loops and the great capacity for foreign antigen insertion make this platform attractive for wide application in vaccine development and antibody production.

The glycan derivatization was also performed at large scale using mg quantities of glycans and excess F-MAPA, and the reaction system was successfully recycled up to 5 times, without apparent decrease in conjugation efficiency. The MAPA-glycan is also easy to link to protein to generate neoglycoproteins with equivalent glycan densities. Importantly, the MAPA linker can be reversibly cleaved to regenerate free reducing glycans for detailed structural analysis (catch-and-release), often critical for functional studies of undefined glycans from natural sources. The high conjugation efficiency, bright fluorescence, and reversible cleavage of the linker enable access natural glycans for functional glycomics.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The development of a reversible, cleavable bifunctional linker 3-(methoxyamino)propylamine (MAPA) that can be reversibly cleaved to regenerate free reducing glycans for detailed structural analysis (catch-and-release), often critical for functional studies of undefined glycans from natural sources."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9927,"details":{"paperId":"55515692c0fe19fd640f1ecbbf0d403b0e5974cb","externalIds":{"MAG":"2125184088","DOI":"10.3851/IMP2553","CorpusId":"46258450","PubMed":"23425865"},"title":"Novel Thiosialosides Tethered to Metal Nanoparticles as Potent Influenza a Virus Haemagglutinin Blockers","abstract":"Background: The purpose of this study was to develop a new class of influenza A virus haemagglutinin (HA) blockers by tethering thiosialoside molecules to metal nanoparticles and producing glycoclusters that enhance the affinity of HA binding by N-acetylneuraminic acid. Methods: Oxygen of the glycoside bond of sialoside was replaced with sulfur to prevent hydrolytic digestion of the N-acetylneuraminic acid residue by viral neuraminidase. Two novel thiosialosides, α-2-S-[p-(N-levulinyl) aminophenyl]-5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac-S-Lev) and α-2-S-[m-(N-levulinyl)aminobenzyl]-5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac-S-CH2-Lev), were tethered onto the surface of metal nanoparticles via an aminooxy functionalized thiol linker in a glycoblotting reaction. Gold (Au) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles were coated simultaneously with 11-mercaptoundecyl phosphorylcholine to reduce non-specific adsorption of proteins. Phosphorylcholine self-assembled monolayercoated metals displaying clustered Neu5Ac (Neu5Ac-PCSAM-Au and Neu5Ac-PCSAM-Ag) were subjected to haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays using the influenza A virus strain A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1).

The virostatic efficacy of C003 could be improved via chemical modification, leading to a de novo synthesized compound 052 (C052).

The most obvious target for antisecretory therapy has been the chloride channel and second messengers within the enterocyte. So far, this search has been largely unrewarding, although recent evidence suggests that a new class of chloride channel blocker is effective in vitro but further evaluation in humans is required.

This new dimension of intestinal pathophysiology has already exposed possible novel targets for antisecretory therapy; namely, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists, substance P antagonists and σ-receptor agonists.

Treatments of proven efficacy are currently limited predominantly to herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal model systems for some important viruses and by the difficulty in conducting human clinical trials for diseases that may be rare, or in the case of arboviral infections, often have variable seasonal and geographic incidence. Nonetheless, many novel approaches to antiviral therapy are available, including candidate thiazolide and pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives with potential broad‐spectrum antiviral efficacy. New herpesvirus drugs include viral helicase‐primase and terminase inhibitors. The use of antisense oligonucleotides and other strategies to interfere with viral RNA translation has shown efficacy in experimental models of CNS viral disease. Identifying specific molecular targets within viral replication cycles has led to many existing antiviral agents and will undoubtedly continue to be the basis of future drug design. A promising new area of research involves therapies based on enhanced understanding of host antiviral immune responses. Toll‐like receptor agonists and drugs that inhibit specific cytokines as well as interferon preparations have all shown potential therapeutic efficacy.

Since therapeutic approaches to RV gastroenteritis are limited to alleviation of dehydration with oral rehydration solutions, more direct approaches to palliate symptoms of RV gastroenteritis are required. Treatments with probiotics have been increasingly recognized as alternative safe and low cost treatments for moderate infectious diarrhea. In this study, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 (BBG9-1), which has been used as an intestinal drug for several decades, was shown to have a remarkable protective effect against RV gastroenteritis in a suckling mice model. As well as prophylactic oral administration of BBG9-1 from 2 days before RV infection, therapeutic oral administration of BBG9-1 from 1 day after RV infection significantly alleviated RV-induced diarrhea. Therapeutic administration of BBG9-1 reduced various types of damage in the small intestine, such as epithelial vacuolization and villous shortening, and significantly diminished the infectious RV titer in mixtures of cecal contents and feces. It was also shown that therapeutic administration of BBG9-1 significantly increased the number of acidic mucin-positive goblet cells and the gene expression of mucosal protective factors including MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, TGFβ1 and TFF3 in the small intestine. This led to alleviation of low gut permeability shown as decreased gene expression levels of occludin, claudin-1 and villin-1 after RV infection. Furthermore, in the small intestine, therapeutic administration of BBG9-1 significantly palliated the decreased gene expression of SGLT-1, which plays an important role in water absorption. In the large intestine, administered BBG9-1 was shown to replicate to assimilate undigested nutrients, resulting in normalization of the abnormally high osmotic pressure. These results suggested that water malabsorption caused by RV infection was alleviated in mice administered BBG9-1. Thus, the present study showed that oral administration of BBG9-1 palliated diarrhea partly through protection against RV-induced lesions by inducing mucosal protective factors. Oral administration of BBG9-1 is thought to be an efficient method for management of an RV epidemic for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Oral administration of Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 palliated diarrhea partly through protection against RV-induced lesions by inducing mucosal protective factors, and suggested that water malabsorption caused by RV infection was alleviated in mice administered BBG 9-1."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6007,"details":{"paperId":"3405f44c2d3145ac1f298f65d32e72ce790f93db","externalIds":{"MAG":"3036407792","DOI":"10.1101/2020.06.16.155465","CorpusId":"219947592"},"title":"Oral administration of a single anti-CfaE nanobody provides broadly cross-protective immunity against major pathogenic Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains","abstract":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is estimated to cause approximately 380,000 deaths annually during sporadic or epidemic outbreaks worldwide. There is currently no vaccine licensed to prevent ETEC. Development of prophylaxis against ETEC is challenging due to the vast heterogeneity of the ETEC strains. The discovery of nanobodies has emerged as a successful new biologics in treating mucosal infectious disease as nanobodies can recognize conserved epitopes on hypervariable pathogens. In this study, we performed large screens using immunized llamas and a naïve nanobody yeast display library against adhesins of colonization factors. Cross-protective nanobodies were selected with in vitro activities inhibiting mannose-resistant hemagglutination (MRHA) against all eleven major pathogenic ETEC strains. Oral administration of nanobodies led to significant reduction of bacterial colonization in animals challenged with multiple ETEC strains. Structural analysis revealed novel conserved epitopes as critical structural features for pan-ETEC vaccine design. Two of the lead nanobodies, 2R215 and 1D7, were further engineered as trimer or fused with human IgA Fc-fragments as fusionbodies. Oral administration of the trimers or fusionbodies protected mice from infection at a much lower dose compared to the monomeric format. Importantly, fusionbodies prevented infection as a pre-treatment when administrated 2 hours before ETEC challenge to the animals. Together, our study provides the first proof of concept that oral administration of a single nanobody could confer broad protection against major pathogenic ETEC strains.

Although in 1980, it accounted for as many as 5 million deaths, the last estimate in 1999 was 2.2 million deaths of adults and children. Such a spectacular decrease in mortality rate is largely because of the increasing use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) (1). However, acute gastroenteritis is a major problem worldwide, with two distinct patterns. In the so-called developing countries, acute gastroenteritis is a dramatic, often catastrophic, condition that may have an epidemic pattern and is associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in younger and malnourished infants. It therefore requires a combined effort to decrease the mortality rate and to prevent the spread of infectious agents, namely Vibrio cholerae. In developed countries, death of gastroenteritis is almost nonexistent, but gastroenteritis is associated with enormous costs either directly (medical expenses) or indirectly (loss of working days by the parents of sick children) because of the frequency of the disease (2). The widespread use of ORS in diarrheal diseases has saved the lives of millions of adults and children with diarrhea. Oral rehydration solution has been called “the most important advance in this century” (3), and this remains so for the turn of the century. However, the ideal composition of ORS is a matter of controversy and heated debate. To gain a wider perspective on the “ideal” ORS, this review will briefly discuss the current understanding of pathophysiologic processes responsible for water and electrolyte absorption from the intestine and their modifications in diarrheal disease.

Following the isolation of rotavirus particles in 1969 and its evidence as an aetiology of severe dehydrating diarrhoea in infants and young children worldwide, the quest to find not only an acceptable and reliable but cost-effective vaccine has continued until now. Four live-attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines (LAORoVs) (Rotarix®, RotaTeq®, Rotavac®, and RotaSIIL®) have been developed and licensed to be used against all forms of rotavirus-associated infection. The efficacy of these vaccines is more obvious in the high-income countries (HIC) compared with the low- to middle-income countries (LMICs); however, the impact is far exceeding in the low-income countries (LICs). Despite the rotavirus vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, more than 90 countries (mostly Asia, America, and Europe) are yet to implement any of these vaccines. Implementation of these vaccines has continued to suffer a setback in these countries due to the vaccine cost, policy, discharging of strategic preventive measures, and infrastructures.

In order to determine whether VP6 alone can induce protective immunity, an expression vector pcDNA1/EDIM6 containing gene 6 of rotavirus EDIM strain was constructed and used as a vaccine in an adult mouse model. Cloned gene 6 was determined to be 1356 nucleotides long and contained a 5' noncoding region of 23 nucleotides, a 3' noncoding region of 139 nucleotides, and a coding frame of 1194 nucleotides for a polypeptide of 397 amino acid residues. Recombinant VP6 was expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and the heat-denatured recombinant VP6 migrated in SDS-gels with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 43 kDa. Five additional polypeptide bands corresponding to oligomers of recombinant VP6 were observed when the expressed product was not heat denatured. To determine the immunogenicity of recombinant VP6, female BALB/c mice were injected intramuscularly or intradermally with pcDNA1/EDIM6, or were inoculated epidermally with plasmid-coated gold beads using the Geniva Accell particle delivery device. Only intradermal injection and particle delivery elicited measurable serum anti-rotavirus IgG responses, but responses developed following particle delivery were significantly (P < 0.001) greater. However, none of the delivery methods induced serum or stool anti-rotavirus IgA responses and, when challenged with EDIM no protection against infection was observed in the immunized mice.

Identification and commercialization of new anti-microbial agents has always been a time-consuming and expensive process, and development of new strategies to control disease are therefore clearly warranted. \n \nThe immune system has evolved to help combat various types of infections. As most pathogens enter through mucosal surfaces, the local immune defence may be of particular importance and evolutionary pressure has led to the development of a specialized immunoglobulin class in secretions—IgA. Patients with primary immunodeficiencies involving IgA are known to be highly susceptible to respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tract infections (for review see [1]), supporting the notion of a crucial role for antibodies in the mucosal defence. \n \nInfection-prone IgA-deficient patients are currently treated with human IgG given systemically [2]. However, a proportion of these patients still suffer from mucosal infections which necessitates development of additional forms of therapy, and human IgG in high doses has previously in fact been given orally, without adverse effects, to healthy volunteers [3] and to patients suffering from a variety of GI infections (for references see [4]). However, from a theoretical point of view human IgG is expected to be less effective than human IgA due to its comparatively low proteolytic stability, and it may also, due to its interaction with complement and phagocytosing cells, provoke an inflammatory reaction. \n \nHuman breast milk, which contains secretory IgA, is known to protect against diarrhoea in infants. Oral administration of purified human immunoglobulin has previously also been suggested to exhibit a prophylactic effect against development of necrotizing enterocolitis in prematurely born children [5] and a therapeutic effect in Campylobacter jejuni [6] and Clostridium difficile [7] induced diarrhoea in immunodeficient patients as well as chronic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology in normal infants [8]. However, the titre against most human pathogens is rather low in the IgA-containing gammaglobulin preparations, and vaccination of volunteers for preparation of hyperimmune products is not feasible. Furthermore, there is always a risk of transmission of infectious agents when using human plasma as a starting material and since the cost for these preparations is high, alternative sources of antibodies must be sought. \n \nThe common dairy cow may be one such alternative, as bovine antibodies are actively transported from plasma to milk in cows and are present in high concentrations in colostrum. The antibodies protect the calves from GI infections during the neonatal period and are of major importance for their survival. Bovine immunoglobulin preparations against rotavirus and Escherichia coli have previously been shown to be effective as prophylaxis against infections and have been commercially available for use in farm animals for decades. During the past few years, bovine immunoglobulin preparations have also been shown to protect against natural infection or challenge with a variety of different microorganisms in man. The effect of therapeutically administered bovine antibodies has not been as well documented, but successful intervention has been demonstrated in Helicobacter pylori, rotavirus and cryptosporidial infections (for references see [4,9]). Interaction between bovine antibodies and the human immune system is limited [10] and the preparation can be given without risk of serious adverse events. \n \nThe titre of antibodies against many human pathogens is low in colostrum from non-immunized animals [4], and although a therapeutic effect has been suggested by oral administration of high doses of non-specific bovine immunoglobulins to patients with chronic diarrhoea [11–14], it is likely that a future product will have to be derived from immunized animals [10]. In this review, we will summarize published data on the use of bovine immunoglobulin-containing preparations for prophylaxis and therapy against selected mucosal infections in man and suggest directions for its future use.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Bovine immunoglobulin preparations against rotavirus and Escherichia coli have previously been shown to be effective as prophylaxis against infections and have been commercially available for use in farm animals for decades."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6314,"details":{"paperId":"9a7d711a6f60f9de63e945602d55bac068bae834","externalIds":{"MAG":"2106896137","DOI":"10.1111/j.1651-2227.1999.tb01311.x","CorpusId":"45497813","PubMed":"10569234"},"title":"Passive immunity against rotavirus in infants","abstract":"Passive immunity against a variety of gastrointestinal infections, using orally administered human antibodies, has been tried in a number of clinical trials.

The results of cell adhesion and western blotting assays demonstrated that arachidin-1 attenuated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced monocyte/EC adhesion and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. Arachidin-1 was demonstrated to exert its inhibitory effects by the attenuation of TNF-α-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation and inhibitor of κB-α (IκBα) degradation.

It has been proposed that adults rather than children should be used as tasting panellists. Performing food challenges in children can be a challenge in itself, and developing and validating food challenge recipes is expensive and labour intensive. If using panels with children, it is important that they can understand the purpose of the test, can concentrate for a sufficient amount of time and most importantly, be able to recognize and describe different kinds of taste and odour of foods (8). This study therefore highlights an important point: Can children correctly identify the taste of a specific food (e.g. milk)? It has previously been reported that 8to 9-year-old children are able to correctly identify a taste as sweet, sour or salty when it was the only taste present, but they performed poorer than adults in correctly identifying components when there were two tastes present (9). This is confirmed by other researchers (8) who report that differences between children and adults are more likely to reveal themselves with complex (i.e. real foods) rather than simple taste stimuli; however, neither of these studies specifically tested to food allergens. A limitation of the study was that the recipes should have been tested in stages, using adults initially, and recipes adapted accordingly. A strength of the study is that the recipes were tested in children, taking into account the international recommended challenge dosages. In conclusion, we found that testing in children with familiar allergenic foods is feasible, although the quality of the blinding may be somehow compromised compared to adults. We were able to validate food challenge recipes for children containing wheat and baked egg. We were unable to validate recipes containing peanut flour and milk.

Nonphagocytosable particles larger than a macrophage induce tissue repair M2 activation. In contrast, phagocytosable chitin microparticles (CMPs, 1-10 μm diameters) induce M1 macrophages that kill intracellular microbes and damage tissues. However, chitosan (deacetylated) microparticles (de-CMPs, 1-10 µm) induce poor M1 activation. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and associated coreceptors in macrophages appear to be required for the M1 activation. To understand the exact mechanism of phagocytosis-mediated M1 activation by chitin, we isolated macrophage proteins that bind to CMPs during early phagocytosis and determined that TLR1, TLR2, CD14, late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor MAPK and mechanistic target of rapamycin activator 1 (LAMTOR1), Lck/Yes novel tyrosine kinase (Lyn), and β-actin formed phagosomal CMP-TLR2 clusters. These proteins were also detected in TLR2 phagosomal clusters in macrophages phagocytosing de-CMPs, but at relatively lower levels than in the CMP-TLR2 clusters.

One approach is to engage primary innate immune defenses against viral infection, such as activating the IFN pathway. In this study, we report that a small, cell-permeable compound called 5,6-di-methylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) can induce protection against vesicular stomatitis virus in vitro and H1N1 influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo through innate immune activation. Using the mouse C10 bronchial epithelial cell line and primary cultures of nasal epithelial cells, we demonstrate DMXAA activates the IFN regulatory factor-3 pathway leading to production of IFN-β and subsequent high-level induction of IFN-β-dependent proteins, such as myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1). Mice treated with DMXAA intranasally elevate mRNA/protein expression of Mx1 and OAS1 in the nasal mucosa, trachea, and lung. When challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of H1N1 influenza A virus, DMXAA reduced viral titers in the lungs and protected 80% of mice from death, even when given at 24 hours before infection. These data show that agents, like DMXAA, that can directly activate innate immune pathways, such as the IFN regulatory factor-3/IFN-β system, in respiratory epithelial cells can be used to protect from influenza pneumonia and potentially in other respiratory viral infections. Development of this approach in humans could be valuable for protecting health care professionals and \"first responders\" in the early stages of viral pandemics or bioterror attacks.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Data show that agents, like DMXAA, that can directly activate innate immune pathways, such as the IFN regulatory factor-3/IFN-β system, in respiratory epithelial cells can be used to protect from influenza pneumonia and potentially in other respiratory viral infections."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":44,"details":{"paperId":"d23d2dc62f30b4c195884cb00e6b7fc967ff2bbf","externalIds":{"MAG":"1504791003","DOI":"10.1002/3527600906.MCB.200400102","CorpusId":"82307096"},"title":"Pharmacology and Emerging Clinical Application of RNA","abstract":"In the living cell, the RNA is an important intermediate of genetic information transfer between DNA and protein. RNA is a single-stranded, flexible, and versatile biopolymer that incorporates many pharmacologically desirable traits of DNA and protein without some of their disadvantages. It is water soluble and nontoxic, produced by chemical synthesis as well as recombinant cloning, faithfully replicates the parental DNA sequence, can be converted to DNA or protein, possesses enzymatic self-cleaving activity, and makes specific RNA–RNA, RNA—DNA, and RNA–protein interactions. The biologically remarkable forms and functions of RNA, such as antisense RNA, ribozymes, RNA decoys, aptamers, and RNA interference, are rooted in this fundamentally unique combination of biochemical traits of the RNA. It is only recently that some of these properties of RNA have been exploited to interfere with or repair dysfunctional or harmful nucleic acids or proteins and to induce therapeutic gene products in a variety of pathological syndromes or infectious diseases.

Currently, we can count on a narrow range of antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in patients. In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus. Recently, drugs used in the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. However, even if these drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment. This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to the health and life of millions of people. The demand, therefore, for new and effective antiviral drugs is very high. This review focuses on three fundamental points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic remedies currently available. (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals. (3) Consideration of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the bioavailability of these compounds or extracts.

There is a dire necessity for antivirals targeting highly conserved genomic domains on SARS-CoV-2 that are less prone to mutation. The nsp12, also known as the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the core component of ‘SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex’, is a potential well-conserved druggable antiviral target. Several FDA-approved RdRp ‘nucleotide analog inhibitors (NAIs)’ such as remdesivir, have been repurposed to treat COVID-19 infections. The NAIs target RdRp protein translation and competitively block the nucleotide insertion into the RNA chain, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication. However, the replication proofreading function of nsp14-ExoN could provide resistance to SARS-CoV-2 against many NAIs. Conversely, the ‘non-nucleoside analog inhibitors (NNAIs)’ bind to allosteric sites on viral polymerase surface, change the redox state; thereby, exert antiviral activity by altering interactions between the enzyme substrate and active core catalytic site of the RdRp. NNAIs neither require metabolic activation (unlike NAIs) nor compete with intracellular pool of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) for anti-RdRp activity. The NNAIs from phytonutrient origin are potential antiviral candidates compared to their synthetic counterparts. Several in-silico studies reported the antiviral spectrum of natural phytonutrient-NNAIs such as Suramin, Silibinin (flavonolignan), Theaflavin (tea polyphenol), Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone), Corilagin (gallotannin), Hesperidin (citrus bioflavonoid), Lycorine (pyrrolidine alkaloid), with superior redox characteristics (free binding energy, hydrogen-bonds, etc.) than antiviral drugs (i.e. remdesivir, favipiravir).

Next-generation vaccines targeting RV VP8∗ are under evaluation, but the role of VP8∗-specific antibodies in human immunity to RV and their potential as immune correlates of protection remains underexplored. Methods We measured plasma RV VP8∗-binding antibodies in 2 cohorts of young children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Plasma from a cohort study of 137 unvaccinated children aged 6-24 months old hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis was assessed for VP8∗ antibody seropositivity. VP8∗ antibodies were compared with the current standard for RV immunity, total RV-specific IgA (RV-IgA). Additionally, VP8∗ antibody responses were measured as part of an immunogenicity trial of a monovalent, oral, live-attenuated RV vaccine (Rotarix). Results Fewer children with acute RV gastroenteritis were seropositive for VP8∗-binding IgA or IgG antibodies at hospital admission compared with RV-IgA, suggesting that the absence of VP8∗-binding antibodies more accurately predicts susceptibility to RV gastroenteritis than RV-IgA in unvaccinated children. However, when present, these antibodies appeared insufficient to protect fully from disease and no threshold antibody level for protection was apparent. In vaccinated children, these antibodies were very poorly induced by Rotarix vaccine, suggesting that VP8∗-specific antibodies alone are not necessary for clinical protection following oral vaccination.

Enterocyte Cl− channels, as the final step in enterotoxin-induced fluid secretion, constitute an attractive class of targets for diarrhea therapy. Chloride channel inhibitors have become a new class of candidates for antisecretion and anti-intestinal motility agents. In the present study, we identified plumbagin as a transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A) inhibitor in a cell-based fluorescence-quenching assay, and the IC50 value was ∼12.46 µM. Short-circuit current measurements showed that plumbagin reversibly inhibited the Eact-induced Cl− current on the apical side of TMEM16A-transfected Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells with no significant effect on cytoplasmic Ca2+ signaling. Notably, plumbagin also inhibited the activity of intestinal epithelial calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in both HT-29 cells and mouse colons, but had no effects on the activity of the Na+-K+ ATPase or K+ channels. In in vivo experiments, the administration of plumbagin reduced both Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin (STa)- and cholera toxin (CT)-induced intestinal fluid secretion. In neonatal mouse models of CT- and rotavirus infection-induced diarrhea, 0.4 µg plumbagin inhibited secretory diarrhea by >40% and 50%, respectively, without affecting intestinal epithelial integrity or the rotaviral infection. In addition, plumbagin exerted inhibitory effects on the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-stimulated Cl− currents. In the evaluations of intestinal motility, plumbagin significantly delayed intestinal motility and inhibited intestinal smooth muscle contractility without an evident impact on contractive frequency. Collectively, our results indicate that plumbagin inhibits both Ca2+- and cAMP-activated Cl− channels, accounting for the mechanisms of plumbagin inhibition of chloride secretion and intestinal motility. Thus, plumbagin can be a lead compound in the treatment of CT-induced, Traveler’s, and rotaviral diarrhea, as well as other types of secretory diarrhea that result from excessive intestinal fluid secretion and increased intestinal peristalsis.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Plumbagin can be a lead compound in the treatment of CT-induced, Traveler’s, and rotaviral diarrhea, as well as other types of secretory diarrhea that result from excessive intestinal fluid secretion and increased intestinal peristalsis."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7844,"details":{"paperId":"22ac9598de1c2f4015de2e1ddfe6933aedcdd053","externalIds":{"MAG":"2226081785","DOI":"10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0282","CorpusId":"7450249","PubMed":"26351319"},"title":"Poly-ADP-Ribose Polymerase as a Therapeutic Target in Pediatric Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma and Pediatric High-Grade Astrocytoma","abstract":"Pediatric high-grade astrocytomas (pHGA) and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are devastating malignancies for which no effective therapies exist. We investigated the therapeutic potential of PARP1 inhibition in preclinical models of pHGA and DIPG. PARP1 levels were characterized in pHGA and DIPG patient samples and tumor-derived cell lines. The effects of PARP inhibitors veliparib, olaparib, and niraparib as monotherapy or as radiosensitizers on cell viability, DNA damage, and PARP1 activity were evaluated in a panel of pHGA and DIPG cell lines. Survival benefit of niraparib was examined in an orthotopic xenograft model of pHGA. About 85% of pHGAs and 76% of DIPG tissue microarray samples expressed PARP1. Six of 8 primary cell lines highly expressed PARP1. Interestingly, across multiple cell lines, some PARP1 protein expression was required for response to PARP inhibition; however, there was no correlation between protein level or PARP1 activity and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Niraparib was the most effective at reducing cell viability and proliferation (MTT and Ki67). Niraparib induced DNA damage (γH2AX foci) and induced growth arrest. Pretreatment of pHGA cells with a sublethal dose of niraparib (1 μmol/L) before 2 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR) decreased the rate of DNA damage repair, colony growth, and relative cell number.

The mechanism of such age-specific host restriction remains unknown. In this study, we explored host mucosal glycans as a potential age-specific factor for attachment of P[11] RVs. Using in vitro binding assays, we demonstrated that VP8* of a P[11] RV (N155) could bind saliva of infants (60.3%, N = 151) but not of adults (0%, N = 48), with a significantly negative correlation between binding of VP8* and ages of infants (P<0.01). Recognition to the infant saliva did not correlate with the ABO, secretor and Lewis histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) but with the binding of the lectin Lycopersicon esculentum (LEA) that is known to recognize the oligomers of N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), a precursor of human HBGAs. Direct evidence of LacNAc involvement in P[11] binding was obtained from specific binding of VP8* with homopolymers of LacNAc in variable lengths through a glycan array analysis of 611 glycans. These results were confirmed by strong binding of VP8* to the Lec2 cell line that expresses LacNAc oligomers but not to the Lec8 cell line lacking the LacNAc. In addition, N155 VP8* and authentic P[11] RVs (human 116E and bovine B223) hemagglutinated human red blood cells that are known to express poly-LacNAc. The potential role of poly-LacNAc in host attachment and infection of RVs has been obtained by abrogation of 116E replication by the PAA-conjugated poly-LacNAc, human milk, and LEA positive infant saliva.

Although efficient suppression of HCV replicon RNA in cell culture has been demonstrated with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against various sequences in the 5′ UTR and coding regions, data regarding siRNA targeting of the 3′ UTR have been lacking. Furthermore, it has not been definitively shown whether the active constructs, identified to date, exert their effect exclusively via suppression of the replicon positive strand, negative strand or some combination of both strands. In the present study, we assayed inhibitory activity of various siRNAs targeting the 3′ UTR by transient transfection in a subgenomic replicon cell culture model. A survey of 13 candidate target sites in the 3′‐UTR X sequence indicated a uniformly low activity of siRNA constructs against the steady‐state level of replicon. In contrast, the majority of these same siRNAs exhibited high activity against HCV X sequences of either polarity when these targets were presented in the context of a mammalian polymerase II mRNA transcript. Transfection of siRNAs directed against other regions of the replicon revealed differences in the magnitude of inhibitory effects against positive‐strand and negative‐strand target sites. Strand preference of siRNA activity was further demonstrated through the introduction of base‐pair‐destabilizing mutations that promote strand‐specific targeting.

To study the potential for resistance, we subjected Huh7 cells harboring HCV replicons to serial passage in 250 μM G418 and increasing concentrations of nitazoxanide or tizoxanide. Passage of the replicon-containing cell lines in either compound resulted in increases in the 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) (7- to 13-fold), EC90s (14- to 36-fold), and 50% cytotoxic concentrations (2- to 4-fold) of both compounds. Serial passage in either compound did not alter the susceptibility of HCV replicons to ribavirin or 2′-C-methylcytidine. Interestingly, serial passage in nitazoxanide or tizoxanide resulted in increased sensitivity to alpha interferon 2b: EC50s and EC90s were reduced three- and eightfold, respectively. Replicons isolated from these cell lines had no greater ability to confer tizoxanide resistance, or increased susceptibility to alpha interferon, than replicons isolated from the parental cell line that had not previously been exposed to nitazoxanide or tizoxanide. These findings are indicative of a cell-mediated activity differing from that of other anti-HCV drugs but complementary with interferon and are consistent with the enhanced response rates observed clinically when nitazoxanide is combined with pegylated interferon therapy.

Despite initiation of numerous clinical trials, a comprehensively effective therapy with clinical benefit is yet to be achieved. However, the interest in MUC1 as a therapeutic target remains unaltered. For all translational studies, it is important to incorporate updated relevant research findings into therapeutic strategies. In this review we present an overview of the antibodies targeting MUC1 in GI cancers, their potential role in immunotherapy (i.e., antibody-drug and radioimmunoconjugates, CAR-T cells), and other novel therapeutic strategies. We also present our perspectives on how the mechanisms of action of different anti-MUC1 antibodies can target specific hallmarks of cancer and therefore be utilized as a combination therapy for better clinical outcomes.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An overview of the antibodies targeting MUC1 in GI cancers, their potential role in immunotherapy (i.e., antibody-drug and radioimmunoconjugates, CAR-T cells), and other novel therapeutic strategies are presented."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2304,"details":{"paperId":"853ced0f1de5310170b496fa3bb6203386b8b932","externalIds":{"MAG":"3035401508","DOI":"10.1016/j.coviro.2020.04.004","CorpusId":"219605232","PubMed":"32526696"},"title":"Potential of plasmid only based reverse genetics of rotavirus for the development of next-generation vaccines.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Plasmid only based reverse genetics systems for species A rotaviruses (RVA) are available since 2017 and are beginning to be explored in structure-function and viral replication studies as well as for testing of antivirals."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3060,"details":{"paperId":"c4e86bd1526248e9711cae24ca259b1b53798752","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8146271","DOI":"10.1016/j.tifs.2021.05.023","CorpusId":"235189142","PubMed":"34054222"},"title":"Potential protective mechanisms of green tea polyphenol EGCG against COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The possible concerted actions of EGCG suggest the importance of further studies on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in humans, and call for epidemiological studies on potential preventive effects of green tea drinking on CO VID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":10042,"details":{"paperId":"6ecb4665e503342ac876a8fe9cbd7e4462595045","externalIds":{"MAG":"2590602311","DOI":"10.4155/tde-2016-0064","CorpusId":"38843666","PubMed":"28222660"},"title":"Potential therapeutic application of dendrimer/cyclodextrin conjugates with targeting ligands as advanced carriers for gene and oligonucleotide drugs.","abstract":"Despite the recent approval of some gene medicines and nucleic acid drugs, further improvement of delivery techniques for these drugs is strongly required.

Their rate of increase is becoming a growing concern worldwide. Recent studies have established that the composition and dysfunction of the gut microbiota are associated with the development of diabetes. For this reason, strategies such as the use of prebiotics to improve intestinal microbial structure and function have become popular. Consumption of prebiotics for modulating the gut microbiota results in the production of microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids that play essential roles in reducing blood glucose levels, mitigating insulin resistance, reducing inflammation, and promoting the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 in the host, and this accounts for the observed remission of metabolic diseases. Prebiotics can be either naturally extracted from non-digestible carbohydrate materials or synthetically produced. In this review, we discussed current findings on how the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites may influence host metabolism to promote health. We provided evidence from various studies that show the ability of prebiotic consumption to alter gut microbial profile, improve gut microbial metabolism and functions, and improve host physiology to alleviate diabetes and obesity.

In mice, susceptibility to BA is ascribed to the lack of maternally derived immune protection. This study investigated whether vaccination of dams against RRV protected their offspring from developing BA.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBefore mating, female mice were vaccinated orally with RotaTeq or Rotarix. Pups (n=243) from both test groups and a control group were intraperitoneally infected with RRV. Sacrifice of the animals was scheduled for days 7, 14 and 21 after infection. Then, gross and mircoscopia findings of the liver and the hepatoduodenal ligament gave evidence of BA, and hepatic viral load was tested by virus-specific real-time PCR, as well as plaque forming units.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo weeks after infection, the incidence of cholestasis was 100% in controls, 77% in pups of RotaTeq-vaccinated dams, and 56% in pups of Rotarix-vaccinated dams. However, in contrast to controls (incidence of BA: 82%) most pups in the test groups recovered (incidence of BA in pups of RotaTeq-vaccinated dams 11%; incidence of BA in pups of Rotarix-vaccinated dams 3%). Hepatic viral load was identical at various time-points in all pups, suggesting that differences in RRV clearance did not underlie this effect.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this mouse model, oral vaccination with RotaTeq and Rotarix prevented most RRV-induced BA.

The interactions among the different viral proteins located in the three concentric layers make the rotavirus particle an excellent model for physico-chemical and biological studies of viral assemblage. SA11-4S rotaviruses subjected to high pressure were inactivated by more than five log units. After pressure treatment, the particles were recovered with slight structural changes when compared to the control. Electron microscopy suggested subtle changes in the viral outer layer in some pressurised particles. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that much more dramatic changes were produced by urea denaturation than by pressure. Based on the fluorescence spectrum, the genome resistance to ribonuclease, and the absence of changes in hydrodynamic properties, there was little or no disruption of the capsid under pressure. On the other hand, hemagglutination assays indicated that the main component affected by pressure was the spike protein VP4, thus accounting for changes in interaction with host cells and greatly reduced infectivity. The changes leading to inactivation did not cause removal of VP4 from the outer capsid, as verified by size-exclusion chromatography. Antibodies raised against pressurised material were as effective as antibodies raised against the intact virus, based on their neutralisation titre in plaque reduction assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and direct interaction with the particle, as measured by gel-filtration chromatography. Therefore, the new conformation of the pressurised particle did not result in loss of immunogenicity. We propose that pressure alters the receptor-binding protein VP4 by triggering changes similar to those produced when the virus interacts with target cells.

Flagellin also induced NLRC4-dependent production of IL-18 and immediate elimination of RV-infected cells. Administration of IL-22 and IL-18 to mice fully recapitulated the capacity of flagellin to prevent or eliminate RV infection and thus holds promise as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. Bacterial flagellin protein protects rotavirus-infected mice by stimulating cytokine production. Flagellin gives rotavirus a one-two punch Rotavirus causes gastroenteritis, which can be especially severe in infants and young children. The bacterial protein flagellin activates the innate immune system and protects mice against a variety of infectious and inflammatory agents. Zhang et al. now report that flagellin both prevented rotavirus infection in mice and cured mice chronically infected with rotavirus. It did so by activating two distinct innate immune signaling pathways, which led to cells in the infected mice producing the cytokines interleukin 22 and interleukin 18. Similar to flagellin, treating mice with both of these cytokines prevented or cured rotavirus infection.

We therefore examined whether Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 (LG2055) could augment immumoglobulin (Ig) A levels and reduce the incidence of diarrhea in a mouse model of RV infection. Methods: Female BALB/c mouse dams were fed a diet containing 0.1% heat-treated LG2055 or a control, beginning 4 weeks before mating with male mice and continuing until the experiment ended. One week after mating, female dams were immunized orally with simian RV SA-11.

RV-specific and total IgA were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: LG2055-fed dams immunized with RV (LG2055/RV) secreted breast milk that significantly lowered the incidence of RV-induced diarrhea in their pups as compared with dams immunized with RV alone (C/RV). The LG2055/RV dams also produced a significantly greater amount of RV-specific IgA in breast milk obtained from the pups’ stomach, but not in feces or Peyer's patch cell cultures. In addition, LG2055 stimulated total IgA production in splenocyte cultures from Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4-knockout mice, but not those from TLR-2-knockouts.

Rotavirus-related deaths represent approximately 5% of all deaths in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide.

The addition of saponins to existing water supplies offers a new form of intervention into the cycle of rotavirus infection.

For example, in a typical year before the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus infection in the United States was responsible for approximately 3.5 million cases of diarrhea, 50,000 hospitalizations, and 20 deaths in children younger than 5 years. Most children become infected with rotavirus, with the highest risk being from (6 months when circulating maternally acquired immune factors decline in infants) through 3 years of age. Although rotavirus vaccines can significantly reduce the incidence of severe rotavirus, issues of cost and infrastructure limit the utility of the vaccine in developing countries and also for some populations in developed countries, such as infants before immunization. Thus, alternative forms of rotavirus protection remain a public health priority. Breast-fed infants have lower rates of diarrhea (1), including rotavirus-associated diarrhea (2). Protection against rotavirus by human milk includes its antirotavirus secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), which is present at varying levels in the milk of most mothers, and the human milk glycoprotein lactadherin, a constitutively produced glycoprotein that is present in all of the milk samples tested (3,4). In a general population, ingestion of probiotics reduces the risk of rotavirus (5). All of these forms of defense only confer partial protection from rotavirus infection. In a marginally nourished infant, a bout of infection, especially one that causes diarrhea, can start the infant on a spiral of malnutrition and disease that can result in death or suboptimal development in those who survive. Thus, finding an inexpensive, facile, and effective means to reduce rotavirus infection in high-risk infant populations remains an important research objective.

Thus, it is highly probable that some common molecules secreted by probiotic and/or commensal bacteria contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protect the intestinal epithelium from injurious stimuli. To address this question, we aimed to isolate the cytoprotective compound from a lactobacillus strain, Lactobacillus brevis SBC8803 which possess the ability to induce cytoprotective heat shock proteins in mouse small intestine.

HSP27-inducible components were separated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and HPLC. Finally, we identified that the HSP27-inducible fraction was polyphosphate (poly P), a simple repeated structure of phosphates, which is a common product of lactobacilli and other bacteria associated with intestinal microflora without any definitive physiological functions. Then, poly P was synthesized by poly P-synthesizing enzyme polyphosphate kinase. The synthesized poly P significantly induced HSP27 from Caco2/BBE cells. In addition, Poly P suppressed the oxidant-induced intestinal permeability in the mouse small intestine and pharmacological inhibitors of p38 MAPK and integrins counteract its protective effect. Daily intrarectal administration of poly P (10 µg) improved the inflammation grade and survival rate in 4% sodium dextran sulfate-administered mice.

The continuing evolution of multidrug resistant pathogens and ineffective therapy for the infections they cause has stimulated interest in the potential of probiotic products to prevent nosocomial infections. Probiotics are viable microorganisms that colonize the host and exert antibacterial and immunomodulatory effects. This article will review the current evidence for probiotics in preventing nosocomial infections, particularly pneumonia in a diverse population of critically ill patients. Recent findings Currently, there are insufficient data to conclusively determine whether probiotics are beneficial in the prevention of nosocomial infections, particularly nosocomial pneumonia. Most of the current literature is limited by poor trial design, inadequate blinding, small study samples, and poorly defined endpoints. Summary Probiotic products reduce pathogenic colonization of the host. Despite the theoretical plausibility, there is currently insufficient evidence that probiotic products reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia. Large, multicenter, randomized clinical trials utilizing a rigorous, invasive diagnostic approach to nosocomial pneumonia need to be performed to prospectively evaluate the utility of probiotic products.

Although some normal consequences of UPR activation (e.g., translation attenuation) are detrimental to viral infection, we have previously shown that HCMV infection adapts the UPR to benefit the viral infection (14). For example, UPR-induced translation attenuation is inhibited by viral infection, while potentially beneficial aspects of the UPR are maintained. In the present work, we tested the ability of HCMV to overcome a robust induction of the UPR by the drugs thapsigargin and clotrimazole (CLT), which disrupt ER calcium homeostasis. A 24-h treatment with these drugs beginning at 48, 72, or 96 h postinfection (hpi) completely inhibited further production of infectious virions. HCMV could not overcome the inhibition of global translation by CLT; however, between 48 and 72 hpi, HCMV overcame translational inhibition caused by thapsigargin. Despite the restoration of translation in thapsigargin, the accumulation of immediate-early and early gene products was modestly retarded (50% or less), whereas the accumulation of an early-late and late gene product was significantly retarded. Electron microscopic analysis shows that the drugs severely disrupt the maturation of HCMV virions.

We report here the development of sdAbs targeting human PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) as an alternative to anti-PCSK9 mAbs. After immunizing a llama with human PCSK9, we selected four sdAbs that bind PCSK9 with a high affinity and produced them as fusion proteins with a mouse Fc. All four sdAb-Fcs recognize the C-terminal Cys-His-rich domain of PCSK9. We performed multiple cellular assays and demonstrated that the selected sdAbs efficiently blocked PCSK9-mediated low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation in cell lines, in human hepatocytes, and in mouse primary hepatocytes. We further showed that the sdAb-Fcs do not affect binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR but rather block its induced cellular LDLR degradation. Pcsk9 knock-out mice expressing a human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene were generated, resulting in plasma levels of ∼300 ng/ml human PCSK9.

ISVPs are thought to be required for two early steps in reovirus infection: membrane penetration and activation of the particle-bound viral transcriptase complexes. Genetic and biochemical evidence implicates outer-capsid protein μ1 in both these steps. To determine whether the cleavage of μ1/μ1C is relevant to the unique properties of ISVPs, we analyzed the properties of novel subvirion particles that lacked ς3 yet retained μ1/μ1C in an uncleaved but cleavable form. These detergent-plus-protease subvirion particles (dpSVPs) were produced by treating virions with chymotrypsin in the presence of micelle-forming concentrations of alkyl sulfate detergents. Infections with dpSVPs in murine L or canine MDCK cells provided evidence that the cleavage of μ1/μ1C during viral entry into these cells is dispensable for reovirus infection. Additionally, dpSVPs behaved like ISVPs in their capacity to permeabilize lipid bilayers and to undergo transcriptase activation in vitro, supporting the conclusion that cleavage of μ1/μ1C to μ1δ/δ and φ during viral entry is not required for either membrane penetration or transcriptase activation in cells.

Other viruses possess lectins on their surfaces that recognize glycan epitopes on human epithelial cells for infection. Human and avian influenza viruses recognize different glycan epitopes, sialic acid- 2,6 galactose (SA-2,6Gal) and SA-2,3Gal, respectively, as their receptors, resulting in different host ranges for these two viruses.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β induce expression of nitric oxide (NO) and reduce the expression of gut tight junction proteins. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary gangliosides (GGs) increase the concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) in response to LPS, thereby inhibiting NO production and protecting gut occludin tight junction protein from degradation. Materials and Methods: Rats were fed semipurified diets with (n = 16) or without (n = 16) GGs (0.1% w/w of total lipid). After 2 weeks of feeding, animals were injected with saline (n = 8/diet group) or LPS (n = 8/diet group) (IP, 3 mg mL−1 kg−1). Intestinal tissue, mucosa, and blood sample were collected 6 hours post-LPS exposure. The effect of dietary GGs on production/expression of IL-10, NO, inducible NO synthase, and occludin protein was determined. Results: Dietary GGs increased IL-10 content in intestinal mucosa significantly by 32-fold (P < 0.0001) and in plasma by 2.4-fold (P < 0.001). Feeding animals a ganglioside-enriched diet decreased total NO content in intestinal mucosa and plasma by 44% and 30%, respectively, and inhibited inducible NO synthase expression following LPS exposure compared with control animals. Dietary GGs reduced the degradation of occludin tight junction protein in response to LPS.

Each year, tens of thousands of people receive anti-rabies prophylaxis with plasma-derived immunoglobulins and vaccine soon after exposure. Anti-rabies immunoglobulins are however expensive and have limited availability. VHH are the smallest antigen-binding functional fragments of camelid heavy chain antibodies, also called Nanobodies. The therapeutic potential of anti-rabies VHH was examined in a mouse model using intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of rabies virus. Anti-rabies VHH were administered directly into the brain or systemically, by intraperitoneal injection, 24 hours after virus challenge. Anti-rabies VHH were able to significantly prolong survival or even completely rescue mice from disease. The therapeutic effect depended on the dose, affinity and brain and plasma half-life of the VHH construct. Increasing the affinity by combining two VHH with a glycine-serine linker into bivalent or biparatopic constructs, increased the neutralizing potency to the picomolar range. Upon direct intracerebral administration, a dose as low as 33 µg of the biparatopic Rab-E8/H7 was still able to establish an anti-rabies effect. The effect of systemic treatment was significantly improved by increasing the half-life of Rab-E8/H7 through linkage with a third VHH targeted against albumin. Intraperitoneal treatment with 1.5 mg (2505 IU, 1 ml) of anti-albumin Rab-E8/H7 prolonged the median survival time from 9 to 15 days and completely rescued 43% of mice. For comparison, intraperitoneal treatment with the highest available dose of human anti-rabies immunoglobulins (65 mg, 111 IU, 1 ml) only prolonged survival by 2 days, without rescue. Overall, the therapeutic benefit seemed well correlated with the time of brain exposure and the plasma half-life of the used VHH construct.

Pushing the limit, we have proposed a protein-ensemble-RNA docking strategy to explicitly consider the protein flexibility in protein-RNA docking through an ensemble of multiple protein structures, which is referred to as MPRDock.

Several quantitative benefit-risk models (qBRm) are performed to measure this balance in hospitalizations and deaths prevented versus the ones induced. Method In this study, our objective was to provide a complete overview of qBRm used for rotavirus vaccination. We systematically searched 3 medical literature databases to identify relevant articles, in English, that were published between 2006 and 2019. Results Of the 276 publications screened, 14 studies using qBRm for rotavirus vaccination were retained, based on preselected criteria. Four were performed in low- and middle-income countries. Almost all (13 of 14) displayed the following characteristics: force of infection assumed to be constant over time (static model), indirect effect of rotavirus vaccination (herd effect) not considered, closed model (individuals not allowed to enter and/or exit the model over time), and aggregated level (no tracking of individual’s behavior). Most of the models were probabilistic (9 of 14) and reported sensitivity and/or scenario analyses (12 of 14). Input parameter values varied across studies. Selected studies suggest that, depending on the models used, for every IS hospitalization and death induced, vaccination would prevent, respectively, 190–1624 and 71–743 RVGE-related hospitalizations and deaths.

The L1 protein alone is capable of self-assembly in vivo into capsidlike structures referred to as viruslike particles (VLPs). We have determined conditions for the quantitative disassembly of purified HPV-11 L1 VLPs to the level of capsomeres, demonstrating that disulfide bonds alone are essential to maintaining long-term HPV-11 L1 VLP structure at physiological ionic strength. The ionic strength of the disassembly reaction was also important, as increased NaCl concentrations inhibited disassembly. Conversely, chelation of cations had no effect on disassembly. Quantitative reassembly to a homogeneous population of 55-nm, 150S VLPs was reliably achieved by the re-formation of disulfide linkages following removal of reducing agent at near-neutral pH and moderate NaCl concentration. HPV-11 L1 VLPs could also be dissociated by treatment with carbonate buffer at pH 9.6, but VLPs could not be regenerated following carbonate treatment.

Although vaccination against RV has been implemented in more than 100 countries, the efficacy of vaccine has been challenged in low-income settings. The lack of any FDA-approved drug against RV is an additional concern regarding the treatment associated with rotavirus-induced infantile death. With the purpose for the discovery of anti-RV therapeutics, we assessed anti-rotaviral potential of quercetin, a well-characterized antioxidant flavonoid. In vitro study revealed that quercetin treatment resulted in diminished production of RV-SA11 (simian strain) viral particles in a concentration-dependent manner as estimated by the plaque assay. Consistent with this result, Western blot analysis also revealed reduced synthesis of viral protein in quercetin-treated RV-SA11-infected MA104 cells compared to vehicle (DMSO) treated controls. Not surprisingly, infection of other RV strains A5-13 (bovine strain) and Wa (Human strain) was also found to be abridged in the presence of quercetin compared to DMSO. The IC50 of quercetin against three RV strains ranges between 2.79 and 4.36 Mm, and S.I. index is greater than 45. Concurrent to the in vitro results, in vivo study in mice model also demonstrated reduced expression of viral proteins and viral titer in the small intestine of quercetin-treated infected mice compared to vehicle-treated infected mice. Furthermore, the result suggested anti-rotaviral activity of quercetin to be interferon-independent. Mechanistic study revealed that the antiviral action of quercetin is co-related with the inhibition of RV-induced early activation of NF-κB pathway.

During the past few years, it has been demonstrated that RNAi, induced by specifically designed double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, can silence gene expression of human viral pathogens both in acute and chronic viral infections. Furthermore, it is now apparent that in in vitro and in some in vivo models, the prospects for this technology in developing therapeutic applications are robust. However, many key questions and obstacles in the translation of RNAi into a potential therapeutic platform still remain, including the specificity and longevity of the silencing effect, and, most importantly, the delivery of the dsRNA that induces the system.

Through the simultaneous introduction of variability at multiple nucleotide positions in the rescue RNA population, the functional contribution of these positions was used to map regions containing cis-acting elements essential for virus viability. Nucleotides that were individually lethal when varied mapped within a region of predicted secondary structure involving base pairing between the 5' and 3' ends of the transcript. An extended region of predicted perfect base pairing located within the 3' untranslated region of the genome segment was also found to be required for virus viability. In contrast to the identification of individually lethal mutations, gross alteration of the composition of this predicted stem region was possible, providing the base-pairing potential between the two strands was maintained, identifying a structural feature predicted to be conserved throughout the Orbivirus genus.

The RV genome consists of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. In some cases, an RNA segment is replaced by a rearranged RNA segment, which is derived from its standard counterpart by partial sequence duplication. We report here a reverse genetics system for RV based on the preferential packaging of rearranged RNA segments. Using this system, wild-type or in vitro-engineered forms of rearranged segment 7 from a human rotavirus (encoding the NSP3 protein), derived from cloned cDNAs and transcribed in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells with the help of T7 RNA polymerase, replaced the wild-type segment 7 of a bovine helper virus (strain RF). Recombinant RF viruses (i.e., engineered monoreassortant RF viruses) containing an exogenous rearranged RNA were recovered by propagating the viral progeny in MA-104 cells, with no need for additional selective pressure. Our findings offer the possibility to extend RV reverse genetics to segments encoding nonstructural or structural proteins for which no potent selective tools, such as neutralizing antibodies, are available. In addition, the system described here is the first to enable the introduction of a mutated gene expressing a modified nonstructural protein into an infectious RV. This reverse genetics system offers new perspectives for investigating RV protein functions and developing recombinant live RV vaccines containing specific changes targeted for attenuation.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The reverse genetics system described here is the first to enable the introduction of a mutated gene expressing a modified nonstructural protein into an infectious RV and offers new perspectives for investigating RV protein functions and developing recombinant live RV vaccines containing specific changes targeted for attenuation."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":10102,"details":{"paperId":"a5a410b3c3900972e03275a001e578379a73c351","externalIds":{"MAG":"2907487672","DOI":"10.4172/2155-9600.1000734","CorpusId":"201198399"},"title":"Recent Advances In Nutritional Sciences: An Overview Of Glycans And MiRNAs","abstract":"There are many nutritional substances that humans consume on a daily basis: water, carbohydrates lipids and proteins are main biochemical components of food. But others in a smaller amount are vitamins minerals and enzymes. At a possibly lesser quantity are glycans and miRNAs. The presence of oligoglycans in all food sources has been an established fact for many years. These special carbohydrates are present as glycoconjugates (glycoproteins or glycolipids) in and on the surface of all the cells (glycocalyx) of all organisms that we eat and remain intact through the GI tract as we lack the enzymatic repertoire of the human body to unbind their particular β-linkages. Glycans bind to naturally present human lectins (through protein-carbohydrate interactions), but also with other human glycans (through carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, or CCI). Moreover, these glycans, like fibres, are digested by the gut microbiota that resides within the intestine. As our biochemistry shapes the composition of the microbiome, so does the composition of glycans and foods that we consume, triggering biological responses. miRNAs are small, single-stranded, 19- to 23- nucleotide-long RNA molecules and affect the stability of messenger RNA (mRNA) influencing protein synthesis. miRNAs are also present in foods and act on both the microbial composition in our gut and may be absorbed by the walls of the GI tract, demonstrating resistance to food processing and enzymatic attack. Though still a topic of controversy, these small, noncoding RNAs that control gene expression may directly enter into the circulating miRNA population of dietary exogenous miRNAs. It can hence be possible to identify a relationship between glycans and miRNAs in food on one side, microbiota composition on the other and the resultant health status of the host (immune system), on the third side.","publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Glycans are small, single-stranded, 19- to 23- nucleotide-long RNA molecules and affect the stability of messenger RNA (mRNA) influencing protein synthesis, and miRNAs are also present in foods and act on both the microbial composition in the authors' gut and may be absorbed by the walls of the GI tract, demonstrating resistance to food processing and enzymatic attack."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4152,"details":{"paperId":"5bb031739b0d937e93c87177a5ddb11304b82197","externalIds":{"MAG":"190838317","DOI":"10.1023/A:1011908128045","CorpusId":"8156253","PubMed":"9647346"},"title":"Recent Advances in Intestinal Macromolecular Drug Delivery via Receptor-Mediated Transport Pathways","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review focuses on recent advances in cellular and molecular biology pertaining to receptor-mediated endocytosis and possible applications of targeting to RME mechanisms to improve oral macromolecular drug delivery."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":102,"details":{"paperId":"8cf758c1d6620fd53d75fde24b7f31122e3fa4e3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2888178209","DOI":"10.1002/adtp.201800065","CorpusId":"92088563"},"title":"Recent Advances in RNA Therapeutics and RNA Delivery Systems Based on Nanoparticles","abstract":"Recently, there have been significant advances in the field of RNA‐based therapeutics harnessing exogenous RNAs including small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) mimics, and in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNAs.

Owing to their easy-production, un-infectiousness, and polyvalence, the recombinant, chimeric vaccines offer a new approach for development of safe, low-cost, and high efficient subunit vaccines against a single or more pathogens or diseases. While the first VLP-based combination vaccine against malaria has been approved for human use, many others are under development with promising future, which are summarized in this commentary.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Owing to their easy-production, un-infectiousness, and polyvalence, the recombinant, chimeric vaccines offer a new approach for development of safe, low-cost, and high efficient subunit vaccines against a single or more pathogens or diseases."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3582,"details":{"paperId":"ed955bddb32e2871f0f6696d626f46f8d3b9c0b7","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.virusres.2022.198911","CorpusId":"252245158","PubMed":"36113355"},"title":"Recent advances in Reovirales viruses reverse genetics research.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review outlines the development and future direction of the RG system for the best studied Reovirales viruses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":697,"details":{"paperId":"e449e02936c5defd7a976c5dcc7e3d8a15a75d36","externalIds":{"MAG":"14479833","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4615-3838-7_34","CorpusId":"29671544","PubMed":"1667066"},"title":"Recent advances in development of a rotavirus vaccine for prevention of severe diarrheal illness of infants and young children.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Diarrheal diseases are an important cause of morbidity in infants and young children in developed countries and a major cause of both morbidity and mortality in this same age group in developing countriesl."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1266,"details":{"paperId":"36cc7922afa0c21541c1d52e3574e78c30ea10c0","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8254061","DOI":"10.1007/s00705-021-05142-7","CorpusId":"235724036","PubMed":"34216267"},"title":"Recent advances in rotavirus reverse genetics and its utilization in basic research and vaccine development","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The recently developed RGS platform is reviewed and its application in studying infection biology, gene reassortment, and development of vaccines against rotavirus disease is discussed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":199,"details":{"paperId":"124b9cb125e851397c0f5b0da6ed30be482e719a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2253186148","DOI":"10.1002/elps.201500477","CorpusId":"5153217","PubMed":"26801168"},"title":"Recent advances on separation and characterization of human milk oligosaccharides","abstract":"Free human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are unique due to their highly complex nature and important emerging biological and protective functions during early life such as prebiotic activity, pathogen deflection, and epithelial and immune cell modulation. Moreover, four genetically determined heterogeneous HMO secretory groups are known to be based on their structure and composition. Over the years, several analytical techniques have been applied to characterize and quantitate HMOs, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high pH anion‐exchange chromatography, off‐line and on‐line mass spectrometry (MS), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Even if these techniques have proven to be efficient and simple, most glycans have no significant UV absorption and derivatization with fluorophore groups prior to separation usually results in higher sensitivity and an improved chromatographic/electrophoretic profile. Consequently, the analysis by HPLC/CE of derivatized milk oligosaccharides with different chromophoric active tags has been developed. However, UV or fluorescence detection does not provide specific structural information and this is a key point in particular related to the highly complex nature of the milk glycan mixtures. As a consequence, for a specific determination of complex mixtures of oligomers, analytical separation is usually required with evaluation by means of MS, which has been successfully applied to HMOs, resulting in efficient compositional analysis and profiling in various milk samples.

Supplementation of the daily milk diet with 3B2 VHH clone produced using a baculovirus vector expression system (final ELISA antibody -Ab- titer of 4096; virus neutralization -VN- titer of 256) for 9 days conferred full protection against rotavirus associated diarrhea and significantly reduced virus shedding. The administration of comparable levels of porcine IgG Abs only protected 4 out of 6 of the animals from human RVA diarrhea but significantly reduced virus shedding. In contrast, G6P[1]-VP6 rotavirus-specific IgY Abs purified from eggs of hyperimmunized hens failed to protect piglets against human RVA-induced diarrhea or virus shedding when administering similar quantities of Abs. The oral administration of VHH nanoAb neither interfered with the host's isotype profiles of the Ab secreting cell responses to rotavirus, nor induced detectable host Ab responses to the treatment in serum or intestinal contents. This study shows that the oral administration of rotavirus VP6-VHH nanoAb is a broadly reactive and effective treatment against rotavirus-induced diarrhea in neonatal pigs.

Long term trends indicate this impact is sustained over the years. Herd effects, protecting unvaccinated children and neonates too young to be vaccinated have been observed in many European countries.

Special attention should be given to preterm infants, who may age out of the vaccination window before hospital discharge and to HIV infected children who are at increased risk of severe rotavirus AGE. There is a small but increased risk of IS following rotavirus vaccination and parents should therefore be informed about possible signs and symptoms of IS.

There have been several big influenza pandemics that have caused millions of human deaths in history, and the threat of influenza viruses to public health is still serious nowadays due to the frequent antigenic drift and antigenic shift events. However, only few effective anti-flu drugs have been developed to date. The high development cost, long research and development time, and drug side effects are the major bottlenecks, which could be relieved by drug repositioning. In this study, we proposed a novel antiviral Drug Repositioning method based on minimizing Matrix Nuclear Norm (DRMNN). Specifically, a virus-drug correlation database consisting of 34 viruses and 205 antiviral drugs was first curated from public databases and published literature. Together with drug similarity on chemical structure and virus sequence similarity, we formulated the drug repositioning problem as a low-rank matrix completion problem, which was solved by minimizing the nuclear norm of a matrix with a few regularization terms. DRMNN was compared with three recent association prediction algorithms. The AUC of DRMNN in the global fivefold cross-validation (fivefold CV) is 0.8661, and the AUC in the local leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) is 0.6929. Experiments have shown that DRMNN is better than other algorithms in predicting which drugs are effective against influenza A virus. With H3N2 as an example, 10 drugs most likely to be effective against H3N2 viruses were listed, among which six drugs were reported, in other literature, to have some effect on the viruses. The protein docking experiments between the chemical structure of the prioritized drugs and viral hemagglutinin protein also provided evidence for the potential of the predicted drugs for the treatment of influenza.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A novel antiviral Drug Repositioning method based on minimizing Matrix Nuclear Norm (DRMNN), which has shown that DRMNN is better than other algorithms in predicting which drugs are effective against influenza A virus."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1424,"details":{"paperId":"cfd16f005f64f642d34e6abe03eecc612492dfdb","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7438026","MAG":"3051520657","DOI":"10.1007/s12079-020-00579-y","CorpusId":"221183318","PubMed":"32815099"},"title":"Repurposing calcium channel blockers as antiviral drugs","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This commentary throws light two scientific papers although with divergent facts converging at a point by suggesting a promising treatment option for CoVID-19."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2336,"details":{"paperId":"9d1be81ae5178fb16625f12dcd763515c7c4b47d","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9123807","DOI":"10.1016/j.drudis.2022.05.016","CorpusId":"248949378","PubMed":"35609743"},"title":"Repurposing of cyclophilin A inhibitors as broad-spectrum antiviral agents","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The structure of cyclosporin A and sanglifehrin A analogs as well as synthetic micromolecules inhibiting CypA are reviewed; and their broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy in the context of the virus lifecycle is discussed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6448,"details":{"paperId":"896b61c0d947ffa8b1c121d1a6520276435c6e8f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2981547077","DOI":"10.1126/scitranslmed.aat5025","CorpusId":"204865730","PubMed":"31645452"},"title":"Repurposing rotavirus vaccines for intratumoral immunotherapy can overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade","abstract":"Rotavirus vaccines have oncolytic properties and can overcome resistance to anti–PD-(L)1/CTLA-4 via RIG-I activation upon intratumoral administration. Repurposing a pediatric vaccine Attenuated virus vaccines such as those used to protect against influenza or chickenpox have already passed manufacturing and regulatory hurdles. Given that many viruses have anticancer properties, Shekarian et al. reasoned that existing vaccines for infectious disease may be useful for treating cancer. They tested several vaccines in vitro and saw that rotavirus vaccines activated NF-κB in a human cell line and were protective against a tumor model resistant to immune checkpoint blockade. Further study of live or inactivated rotavirus strains in multiple tumor models showed RIG-I activation and durable immunity, especially when combined with other immunotherapies. These studies indicate that rotavirus vaccines already in production and circulation could be considered as anticancer agents. Although immune checkpoint–targeted therapies are currently revolutionizing cancer care, only a minority of patients develop durable objective responses to anti–PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 therapy. Therefore, new therapeutic interventions are needed to increase the immunogenicity of tumors and overcome the resistance to these immunotherapies. Oncolytic properties of common viruses can be exploited for the priming of antitumor immunity, and such oncolytic viruses are currently in active clinical development in combination with immune checkpoint–targeted therapies. However, the routine implementation of these therapies is limited by their manufacturing constraints, the risk of exposure of clinical staff, and the ongoing regulations on genetically modified organisms. We sought to determine whether anti-infectious disease vaccines could be used as a commercially available source of immunostimulatory agents for cancer immunotherapy. We found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties. In vitro, they can directly kill cancer cells with features of immunogenic cell death. In vivo, intratumoral rotavirus therapy has antitumor effects that are dependent on the immune system. In several immunocompetent murine tumor models, intratumoral rotavirus overcomes resistance to and synergizes with immune checkpoint–targeted therapy. Heat- and UV-inactivated rotavirus lost their oncolytic activity but kept their synergy with immune checkpoint–targeted antibodies through the up-regulation of the double-stranded RNA receptor retinoic acid–induced gene 1 (RIG-I). Rotavirus vaccines are clinical-grade products used in pediatric and adult populations. Therefore, in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotavirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties, and in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotvirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8359,"details":{"paperId":"9380864e2a33df7223be9fb559de62ffd68d9dac","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3907549","MAG":"2089277505","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0087790","CorpusId":"490637","PubMed":"24498196"},"title":"Rescue of Infectious Birnavirus from Recombinant Ribonucleoprotein Complexes","abstract":"Birnaviruses are unconventional members of the icosahedral double-stranded (dsRNA) RNA virus group. The main differential birnavirus trait is the lack of the inner icosahedral transcriptional core, a ubiquitous structure conserved in all other icosahedral dsRNA viruses, that shelters the genome from cellular dsRNA sensors and provide the enzymatic machinery to produce and extrude mature messenger RNAs. In contrast, birnaviral particles enclose ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes formed by the genome segments, the dsRNA-binding VP3 polypeptide and the virus-encoded RNA polymerase (RdRp). The presence of RNPs suggests that the birnavirus replication program might exhibit significant differences with respect to those of prototypal dsRNA viruses. However, experimental evidences supporting this hypothesis are as yet scarce. Of particular relevance for the understanding of birnavirus replication is to determine whether RNPs act as intracellular capsid-independent transcriptional units. Our study was focused to answer this question using the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), the best characterized birnavirus, as model virus. Here, we describe the intracellular assembly of functional IBDV RNPs in the absence of the virus-encoded VP2 capsid polypeptide. Recombinant RNPs are generated upon coexpression of the IBDV VP1 and RdRp polypeptides and transfection of purified virus dsRNA.

In this study, we have investigated the role that the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) plays in the sensitivity of these three viruses toward the antiviral action of chicken interferon. Our data suggest that while interferon priming of avian cells blocks vaccinia virus replication by promoting PKR activation, the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus appears to be blocked at a pretranslational step. Our data further suggest that the replication of avian reovirus in chicken cells is quite resistant to interferon priming because this virus uses strategies to downregulate PKR activation and also because translation of avian reovirus mRNAs is more resistant to phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of initiation factor eIF2 than translation of their cellular counterparts. Our results further reveal that the avian reovirus protein sigmaA is able to prevent PKR activation and that this function is dependent on its double-stranded RNA-binding activity. Finally, this study demonstrates that vaccinia virus and avian reovirus, but not vesicular stomatitis virus, express/induce factors that counteract the ability of dithiothreitol to promote eIF2 phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that each of the three different viruses used in this study elicits distinct responses to interferon and to dithiothreitol-induced eIF2 phosphorylation when infecting avian cells. IMPORTANCE Type I interferons constitute the first barrier of defense against viral infections, and one of the best characterized antiviral strategies is mediated by the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR). The results of this study revealed that IFN priming of avian cells has little effect on avian reovirus (ARV) replication but drastically diminishes the replication of vaccinia virus (VV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by PKR-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. Our data also demonstrate that the dsRNA-binding ability of ARV protein sigmaA plays a key role in the resistance of ARV toward IFN by preventing PKR activation. Our findings will contribute to improve the current understanding of the interaction of viruses with the host's innate immune system.

Methods:Forty-one men and three women infected with HIV and treated with HAART, and 15 healthy hospital staff members were immunized with trivalent influenza subunit vaccine. Antibody titres were determined by haemagglutination inhibiting assay in sera obtained before and 30 days after immunization.

ABSTRACT Species A rotaviruses (RVs) are a leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in infants and children younger than 5 years. Currently available RV vaccines were adapted from wild-type RV strains by serial passage of cultured cells or by reassortment between human and animal RV strains. These traditional methods require large-scale screening and genotyping to obtain vaccine candidates. Reverse genetics is a tractable, rapid, and reproducible approach to generating recombinant RV vaccine candidates carrying any VP4 and VP7 genes that provide selected antigenicity. Here, we developed a vaccine platform by generating recombinant RVs carrying VP4 (P[4] and P[8]), VP7 (G1, G2, G3, G8, and G9), and/or VP6 genes cloned from human RV clinical samples using the simian RV SA11 strain (G3P[2]) as a backbone. Neutralization assays using monoclonal antibodies and murine antisera revealed that recombinant VP4 and VP7 monoreassortant viruses exhibited altered antigenicity. However, replication of VP4 monoreassortant viruses was severely impaired. Generation of recombinant RVs harboring a chimeric VP4 protein for SA11 and human RV gene components revealed that the VP8* fragment was responsible for efficient infectivity of recombinant RVs. Although this system must be improved because the yield of vaccine viruses directly affects vaccine manufacturing costs, reverse genetics requires less time than traditional methods and enables rapid production of safe and effective vaccine candidates.

ABSTRACT Group A rotavirus (RV) is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. Recently, we established an entirely plasmid-based reverse genetics system for simian RV strain SA11. Although that system was robust enough to generate reassortant RVs, including human RV gene segments, and enabled better understanding of the biological differences between animal and human RV strains, a complete reverse genetics system for human RV strains is desirable. Here, we established a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for G4P[8] human RV strain Odelia. This technology was used to generate a panel of monoreassortant viruses between human and simian RV strains for all of the 11 gene segments demonstrating full compatibility between human and simian RV strains. Furthermore, we generated recombinant viruses lacking the C-terminal region of the viral nonstructural protein NSP1 and used it to define the biological function of the interaction between NSP1 and its target protein β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) during viral replication. While the NSP1 truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal 13 amino acids displayed lower β-TrCP degradation activity, it replicated as efficiently as the wild-type virus. In contrast, the truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal 166 amino acids of NSP1 replicated poorly, suggesting that the C-terminal region of NSP1 plays critical roles in viral replication. The system reported here will allow generation of engineered recombinant virus harboring desired mutations, increase our understanding of the molecular biology of human RV, and facilitate development of novel therapeutics and vaccines. IMPORTANCE Reverse genetics, an approach used to generate viruses from cloned cDNA, has increased our understanding of virus biology. Worldwide research led to the development of an entirely plasmid-based reverse genetics system for the simian RV laboratory strain. Although the technique allows generation of gene-modified recombinant RVs, biological differences between animal and human RVs mean that reverse genetics systems for human RV strains are still needed.

NBV was first isolated from a fruit bat in Australia more than 40 years ago, but it was not associated with any disease. However, several NBV strains have been recently identified as causative agents for respiratory tract infections in humans. Isolation of these pathogenic bat reoviruses from patients suggests that NBVs have evolved to propagate in humans in the form of zoonosis. To date, no strategy has been developed to rescue infectious viruses from cloned cDNA for any member of the fusogenic orthoreoviruses. In this study, we report the development of a plasmid-based reverse genetics system free of helper viruses and independent of any selection for NBV isolated from humans with acute respiratory infection. cDNAs corresponding to each of the 10 full-length RNA gene segments of NBV were cotransfected into culture cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase, and viable NBV was isolated using a plaque assay. The growth kinetics and cell-to-cell fusion activity of recombinant strains, rescued using the reverse genetics system, were indistinguishable from those of native strains. We used the reverse genetics system to generate viruses deficient in the cell attachment protein σC to define the biological function of this protein in the viral life cycle. Our results with σC-deficient viruses demonstrated that σC is dispensable for cell attachment in several cell lines, including murine fibroblast L929 cells but not in human lung epithelial A549 cells, and plays a critical role in viral pathogenesis. We also used the system to rescue a virus that expresses a yellow fluorescent protein.

Mutations can occur spontaneously or be produced by physical or chemical means: for example, the application of different temperatures or mutagens (such as hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, or alkylating agents) that alter the nucleic acid. The classic way to study virus mutants is to identify a change in phenotype compared with the wild-type and to correlate this with the mutant genotype (“forward genetics”). Mutants can be studied by complementation, recombination, or reassortment analyses. These approaches, although very useful, are cumbersome and prone to problems by often finding several mutations in a genome that are difficult to correlate with a change in phenotype. With the availability of the nucleotide sequences of most viral genomes and of the tools of genetic engineering, this stratagem has drastically changed. One can now start with rationally engineering particular mutations in individual viral genes, followed by production of infectious viral particles and exploration of the phenotype (“reverse genetics”). Whereas forward genetics investigates the genetics underlying a phenotype, reverse genetics observes the phenotypic changes arising from genetic changes that were “made to order.”\n\nReverse genetics is a relatively straightforward task with DNA viruses because virtually all viral DNA genomes, which can be mutated in vitro, are infectious upon transfection.

Neonatal gnotobiotic pigs consuming a prophylactic synbiotic combination of probiotics and rice bran (Pro+RB) did not exhibit HRV diarrhea after challenge. Multiple immune, gut barrier protective, and anti-diarrheal mechanisms contributed to the prophylactic efficacy of Pro+RB when compared to probiotics (Pro) alone. In order to understand the molecular signature associated with diarrheal protection by Pro+RB, a global non-targeted metabolomics approach was applied to investigate the large intestinal contents and serum of neonatal gnotobiotic pigs. The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry platform revealed significantly different metabolites (293 in LIC and 84 in serum) in the pigs fed Pro+RB compared to Pro, and many of these metabolites were lipids and amino acid/peptides. Lipid metabolites included 2-oleoylglycerol (increased 293.40-fold in LIC of Pro+RB, p = 3.04E-10), which can modulate gastric emptying, andhyodeoxycholate (decreased 0.054-fold in the LIC of Pro+RB, p = 0.0040) that can increase colonic mucus production to improve intestinal barrier function. Amino acid metabolites included cysteine (decreased 0.40-fold in LIC, p = 0.033, and 0.62-fold in serum, p = 0.014 of Pro+RB), which has been found to reduce inflammation, lower oxidative stress and modulate mucosal immunity, and histamine (decreased 0.18-fold in LIC, p = 0.00030, of Pro+RB and 1.57-fold in serum, p = 0.043), which modulates local and systemic inflammatory responses as well as influences the enteric nervous system. Alterations to entire LIC and serum metabolic pathways further contributed to the anti-diarrheal and anti-viral activities of Pro+RB such as sphingolipid, mono/diacylglycerol, fatty acid, secondary bile acid, and polyamine metabolism. Sphingolipid and long chain fatty acid profiles influenced the ability of HRV to both infect and replicate within cells, suggesting that Pro+RB created a protective lipid profile that interferes with HRV activity. Polyamines act on enterocyte calcium-sensing receptors to modulate intracellular calcium levels, and may directly interfere with rotavirus replication.

We reviewed medical records and visits for intussusception within 7 days after monovalent rotavirus vaccination from April 2008 through March 2013. Using sequential analyses, we then compared the risk of intussusception among children receiving monovalent rotavirus vaccine with historical background rates. We further compared the risk after monovalent rotavirus vaccination with the risk in a concurrent cohort of infants who received the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the study period, 207,955 doses of monovalent rotavirus vaccine (including 115,908 first doses and 92,047 second doses) were administered in the VSD population.

Oncolytic viruses exhibit tumor tropism, ability to enhance anti-tumor immunity and ability to be used in combination with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We have recently selected some rotavirus isolates which are adapted to efficiently infect and kill tumor cell lines. Aim: We tested five tumor cell-adapted rotavirus isolates for their ability to infect the human adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. Methods: Cell surface membrane-associated proteins mediating virus particle attachment were characterized using ELISA, immunoprecipitation, FACS analysis, and antibody blocking. Results: It was found that heat shock proteins (HSPs) such as Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp60, and Hsp40 are expressed on the cell surface forming complexes with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), integrin β3, and heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) in lipid raft microdomains. Interaction of rotavirus isolates with these cellular proteins was further confirmed by a competition assay and an inhibition assay involving the HSPs tested.

Previously, we observed that RosA inhibited T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)- induced interleukin 2 (IL-2) expression and subsequent T-cell proliferation in vitro. In this study, we investigated in detail inhibitory mechanism of RosA on TCR signaling, which ultimately activates IL-2 promoter by activating transcription factors, such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and activating protein-1 (AP-1). Interestingly, RosA inhibited NF-AT activation but not AP-1, suggesting that RosA inhibits Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways only. Signaling events upstream of NF-AT activation, such as the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and Ca(2+) mobilization, and tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1) were strongly inhibited by RosA. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 is largely dependent on 3 kinds of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), ie, Lck, ZAP-70, and Itk. We found that RosA efficiently inhibited TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Itk but did not inhibit Lck or ZAP-70. ZAP-70-dependent signaling pathways such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76 and serine/threonine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were intact in the presence of RosA, confirming that RosA suppresses TCR signaling in a ZAP-70-independent manner.

While these antibodies do not have traditional in vitro neutralizing activity, they could mediate their antiviral activity either by interfering with the viral replication cycle along the IgA secretory pathway or by acting at mucosal surfaces as secretory IgA and excluding virus from target enterocytes. We sought to determine the critical step at which antirotaviral activity was initiated by the IgA7D9 MAb. The IgA7D9 MAb appeared to directly interact with purified triple-layer viral particles, as shown by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. However, protection was not conferred by passively feeding mice with the secretory IgA7D9 MAb. This indicates that the secretory IgA7D9 MAb does not confer protection by supplying immune exclusion activity in vivo. We next evaluated the capacity of polymeric IgA7D9 MAb to neutralize rotavirus intracellularly during transcytosis. We found that when polymeric IgA7D9 MAb was applied to the basolateral pole of polarized Caco-2 intestinal cells, it significantly reduced viral replication and prevented the loss of barrier function induced by apical exposure of the cell monolayer to rotavirus, supporting the conclusion that the antibody carries out its antiviral activity intracellularly.

Live, oral rotavirus vaccines are more effective at preventing rotavirus disease in countries with low child mortality compared with high child mortality. Among several hypotheses, poorer protection in malnourished children, who are more prevalent in countries with high child mortality, may partially explain this difference. We conducted a literature search to identify articles with a laboratory-confirmed rotavirus endpoint that evaluated differences by malnutrition status in rotavirus vaccine effectiveness and vaccine efficacy (VE) or the prevalence of rotavirus infection or illness among children <5 years old. We identified 7 analyses from 11 countries published from 2007 to 2019 that stratified rotavirus VE by malnutrition status. Among well-nourished children, VE point estimates ranged from 71% to 84% in observational studies and 26% to 61% in clinical trials. Among malnourished children, they ranged from −28% to 45% in observational studies and −3% to 61% in clinical trials. The relative difference between VE in well-nourished and malnourished children by length-for-age ranged from 37% to 64%, by weight-for-age ranged from 0% to 107%, and by weight-for-height ranged from −65% to 137%.

Determining the structural and mechanistic basis of broad protection can contribute to understanding the current limitations of vaccine efficacy in developing countries. ABSTRACT Rotavirus live-attenuated vaccines, both mono- and pentavalent, generate broadly heterotypic protection. B-cells isolated from adults encode neutralizing antibodies, some with affinity for VP5*, that afford broad protection in mice. We have mapped the epitope of one such antibody by determining the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of its antigen-binding fragment (Fab) bound to the virion of a candidate vaccine strain, CDC-9. The Fab contacts both the distal end of a VP5* β-barrel domain and the two VP8* lectin-like domains at the tip of a projecting spike. Its interactions with VP8* do not impinge on the likely receptor-binding site, suggesting that the mechanism of neutralization is at a step subsequent to initial attachment. We also examined structures of CDC-9 virions from two different stages of serial passaging. Nearly all the VP4 (cleaved to VP8*/VP5*) spikes on particles from the earlier passage (wild-type isolate) had transitioned from the “upright” conformation present on fully infectious virions to the “reversed” conformation that is probably the end state of membrane insertion, unable to mediate penetration, consistent with the very low in vitro infectivity of the wild-type isolate. About half the VP4 spikes were upright on particles from the later passage, which had recovered substantial in vitro infectivity but had acquired an attenuated phenotype in neonatal rats. A mutation in VP4 that occurred during passaging appears to stabilize the interface at the apex of the spike and could account for the greater stability of the upright spikes on the late-passage, attenuated isolate. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus live-attenuated vaccines generate broadly heterotypic protection, and B-cells isolated from adults encode antibodies that are broadly protective in mice. Determining the structural and mechanistic basis of broad protection can contribute to understanding the current limitations of vaccine efficacy in developing countries. The structure of an attenuated human rotavirus isolate (CDC-9) bound with the Fab fragment of a broadly heterotypic protective antibody shows that protection is probably due to inhibition of the conformational transition in the viral spike protein (VP4) critical for viral penetration, rather than to inhibition of receptor binding. A comparison of structures of CDC-9 virus particles at two stages of serial passaging supports a proposed mechanism for initial steps in rotavirus membrane penetration.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The structure of an attenuated human rotavirus isolate (CDC-9) bound with the Fab fragment of a broadly heterotypic protective antibody shows that protection is probably due to inhibition of the conformational transition in the viral spike protein (VP4) critical for viral penetration, rather than to inhibitionof receptor binding."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1321,"details":{"paperId":"2723de7a6d0d7b8a2e1c304fdb46a6f38bcb0e9f","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s10989-012-9314-z","CorpusId":"254743729"},"title":"Rotavirus VP4 and VP7-Derived Synthetic Peptides as Potential Substrates of Protein Disulfide Isomerase Lead to Inhibition of Rotavirus Infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results showed that even though cysteine residues in the peptides tested are important in both virus infectivity inhibition and in vitro PDI–peptide interaction, the accompanying amino acid sequence also plays some role."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7833,"details":{"paperId":"3650e4f14ddc695abc49b008e478da878c124fa6","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7204108","MAG":"3001604072","DOI":"10.1155/2020/3194704","CorpusId":"211091548","PubMed":"32411793"},"title":"Rotavirus VP6 Adjuvant Effect on Norovirus GII.4 Virus-Like Particle Uptake and Presentation by Bone Marrow-Derived Dendritic Cells In Vitro and In Vivo","abstract":"We have previously shown that rotavirus (RV) inner capsid protein VP6 has an adjuvant effect on norovirus (NoV) virus-like particle- (VLP-) induced immune responses and studied the adjuvant mechanism in immortalized cell lines used as antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

Although these vaccines are shown to reduce the mortality up to 50%, several key questions yet remained to answer. Indeed, the licensed RV vaccines were found to be less effective in countries of sub‐Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Therefore, developing next generation RVA vaccines is warranted. VP6 is highly abundant and conserved protein that forms the middle layer of RV particles and was shown to be both antigenic and immunogenic. Although it does not induce neutralizing antibodies, different VP6 preparations were found to induce homologous and cross‐reactive immune responses with partial protection from RVA replication.

Methods: For the purpose of looking at the effectiveness of the Belgian rotavirus vaccination policy, 3 years after introduction, we retrospectively collated the publicly available data on the number of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus cases reported to a national network of sentinel laboratories during 1999 to 2010 and compared them with the available data on hospitalizations due to rotavirus gastroenteritis. Results: Both data sources (reported laboratory-diagnosed cases to a sentinel network as well as data on hospitalizations due to rotavirus gastroenteritis) show a decrease in the number of rotavirus infections and a 4- to 6-week delay in the onset of disease and the peak of incidence in the postvaccination period. Conclusions: Because this decline coincides with the increased vaccine uptake and is sustained during consecutive rotavirus seasons, the effect is mainly attributed to the rotavirus vaccination.

The 2 multinational vaccines prequalified in 2006 (ROTARIX and RotaTeq) are included in the national immunization programs or in phased subnational introductions in 95 countries across the globe. Substantial reductions in diarrhea-associated deaths and hospitalizations have been recorded from multiple countries in Africa, the Americas, and Europe.1 On the other hand, ROTAVAC is an indigenous, naturally attenuated monovalent G9P[11] rotavirus strain isolated at the All India Institute of Medicine and developed by Bharat Biotech with support from the local Department of Biotechnology, the Indo-US Vaccine Action Program, and PATH. ROTAVAC was licensed by the Drugs Controller General of India in 2015 and has been implemented in a staged introduction plan in India, where implementation first occurred in 4 states in 2016 and in an additional 5 states in 2017; Uttar Pradesh, India, is predicted to introduce ROTAVAC in 2018, thus providing rotavirus vaccination to almost 50% of the birth cohort.

This vaccine was licensed in 2000 and has been available on the Chinese private market with an estimated 60 million doses provided. A large case-control effectiveness study reported the LLR vaccine effectiveness at 35% against rotavirus gastroenteritis and 53% against moderate to severe diarrhea.5 The study by Fu and colleagues6 provides a population-based analysis of LLR vaccination coverage and its association with rotavirus gastroenteritis using several data sets from Guangzhou, China, from May 2007 to April 2016. Unfortunately, rotavirus vaccination is not included in China’s national immunization program, resulting in low coverage rates due to only private market use. The recommended schedule for LLR vaccination is as a single oral dose annually to infants 2 months to 3 years of age, and in Guangzhou the coverage rates ranged from 6.8% to 28.6% among 12 districts studied between 2009 and 2011.

Vaccination is the only control measure likely to have a significant impact on the incidence of severe dehydrating rotavirus disease.

Two new live, oral, attenuated rotavirus vaccines were licensed in 2006: the pentavalent bovine-human reassortant vaccine (RotaTeq) and the monovalent human rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix). Both vaccines have demonstrated very good safety and efficacy profiles in large clinical trials in western industrialized countries and in Latin America. Careful surveillance has not revealed any increased risk of intussusception in the vaccinated groups with either vaccine.

In Zambia, despite the introduction of the vaccine acute diarrhoea due to rotaviruses has continued to affect children aged five years and below. This study aimed to characterise the rotavirus genotypes which were responsible for diarrhoeal infections in vaccinated infants aged 2 to 12 months and to determine the relationship between rotavirus strains and the severity of diarrhoea in 2016. Methods Stool samples from infants aged 2 to 12 months who presented to the hospital with acute diarrhoea of three or more episodes in 24 hours were tested for group A rotavirus. All positive specimens that had enough sample were genotyped using reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

Blocking assay using human saliva or synthetic histo-blood group antigens was employed to test NoV blocking antibodies. Suboptimal doses of the VLPs alone did not induce substantial anti-NoV antibodies.

Serum IgA antibody is a marker of clinical protection against severe RVGE after RV infection and vaccination. This study investigated VP6‐specificity of anti‐RV IgA antibody levels in Finnish children aged 6–23 months before and after introduction of RotaTeq® into national immunization program. Although RV inner capsid protein VP6 is considered as antigenic target in clinical and seroepidemiological studies, at present VP6 protein is not commonly employed as a primary ELISA‐antigen. Thus, sera from 20 unvaccinated and 19 vaccinated children were examined in ELISA with recombinant VP6 (rVP6) protein, and the VP6‐specific responses were compared to responses observed with human RV Wa and bovine RV WC3 cell culture antigens. Moreover, fecal antibodies were tested with rVP6 and Wa cell culture antigen. Equal levels of serum anti‐RV IgA antibodies were detected by the three antigens. Fecal IgA titers against rVP6 and Wa antigen showed a correlation with the corresponding serum levels. The results suggest that the IgA response measured by virus‐capture ELISA is mainly directed to VP6 protein, supporting the usage of rVP6 in detection of anti‐RV IgA antibodies.

Overcoming these obstacles will require great investment and also time, therefore more effective vaccines should be developed to meet the needs of those who would benefit the most from them. Increasing our current knowledge of mucosal immunity, response to Rotavirus infection and its modulation by circadian rhythms could point at actionable pathways to improve vaccination efficacy, especially in the case of individuals affected by environmental enteropathy. Also, a better understanding and validation of Rotavirus entry factors as well as the systematic monitoring of dominant strains could assist in tailoring vaccines to individual’s needs. Another aspect that could improve vaccine efficiency is targeting to M cells, for which new ligands could potentially be sought.

This paper describes the protocol for surveillance to monitor the performance of rotavirus vaccine following its introduction into the routine childhood immunisation programme. Methods An active surveillance system was established to identify acute gastroenteritis cases among children less than 5 years of age. For all children enrolled at sentinel sites, case reporting forms are completed and a copy of vaccination record and a stool specimen obtained. The forms and specimens are sent to the referral laboratory for data entry, analysis, testing and storage. Data from sentinel sites in states that have introduced rotavirus vaccine into their routine immunisation schedule will be used to determine rotavirus vaccine impact and effectiveness.

Rotavirus vaccines (RVV) can dramatically reduce RV deaths, but have low efficacy in low-income settings where they are most needed. The intestinal microbiome may contribute to this decreased RVV efficacy. This pilot study hypothesizes that infants' intestinal microbiota composition correlates with RVV immune responses and that RVV responders have different gut microbiota as compared to non-responders. We conducted a nested, matched case-control study comparing the pre-vaccination intestinal microbiota composition between 10 6-week old Pakistani RVV-responders, 10 6-week old Pakistani RVV non-responders, and 10 healthy Dutch infants. RVV response was defined as an Immunoglobulin A of ≥20 IU/mL following Rotarix™(RV1) vaccination in an infant with a pre-vaccination IgA<20. Infants were matched in a 1:1 ratio using ranked variables: RV1 dosing schedule (6/10/14; 6/10; or 10/14 weeks), RV season, delivery mode, delivery place, breastfeeding practices, age and gender. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using a highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray. RV1 response correlated with a higher relative abundance of bacteria belonging to Clostridium cluster XI and Proteobacteria, including bacteria related to Serratia and Escherichia coli. Remarkably, abundance of these Proteobacteria was also significantly higher in Dutch infants when compared to RV1-non-responders in Pakistan.

Rather than other control measures, vaccination is most likely to have a major impact on rotavirus disease incidence. The peak incidence of rotavirus diarrhea occurs between 6 and 24 months of age. In developing countries, however, cases are not uncommon among children younger than 6 months. G serotypes 1 to 4 are responsible for most disease, but there are indications that in Brazil that G type 5 is of emerging epidemiological importance. Both homotypic and heterotypic responses are elicited during natural rotavirus infection, and the immunological response at the intestinal mucosal surface is probably the more consistent predictor of clinical immunity. With the primary objective of protecting children against life-threatening dehydrating diarrhea, many approaches to rotavirus vaccine development have been attempted. One vaccine, the tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV), was given licensing approval in the United States of America, introduced to the market, and later withdrawn. A number of studies have found better efficacy of RRV-TV in developed countries than in developing ones. Field trials with a 4 x 10(4) plaque-forming units (PFU) preparation of RRV-TV have been carried out in two countries in Latin America, Brazil and Peru. Those trials yielded protective efficacy rates against all rotavirus diarrhea ranging from 18% to 35%. Data from a large catchment trial in Venezuela with a higher RRV-TV dose, of 4 x 10(5) PFU/dose, indicated an efficacy rate of 48% against all rotavirus diarrhea and 88% against severe rotavirus diarrhea. It appears that breast-feeding does not compromise the efficacy of RRV-TV if three doses of the vaccine are administered. Similarly, possible interference of oral poliovirus vaccine with the \"take\" of the rotavirus vaccine can be overcome by giving three doses of the rotavirus vaccine or by using a higher-titer formulation of it. Wild enteroviruses, however, may cause primary rotavirus vaccine failure in developing countries. Studies in Peru with RRV-TV have shown a trend towards higher vaccine efficacy rates against \"pure\" (rotavirus-only) diarrheal episodes. Economic analyses made in the United States indicate that a vaccine that costs less than US$ 9 per dose would lead to a net savings in medical costs. To date, however, cost-benefit studies have not been done in developing countries. In the future, it is possible that some Latin American countries might adapt their polio production facilities to the preparation of rotavirus vaccines for human use. A year after RRV-TV was licensed for vaccination of infants in the United States, the occurrence of intussusception as an adverse event led to the vaccine's withdrawal from the market. The implications of that action, particularly for Latin America, will be addressed in this article, including the need to explore alternative rotavirus candidate vaccines, particularly through the conduct of parallel clinical trials in both developed and developing countries.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Economic analyses made in the United States indicate that a vaccine that costs less than US$ 9 per dose would lead to a net savings in medical costs, and a number of studies have found better efficacy of RRV-TV in developed countries than in developing ones."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":819,"details":{"paperId":"7980710c02dcc35474f313a8ca4a0023b9f4e012","externalIds":{"MAG":"79169169","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-78256-5_10","CorpusId":"9830547","PubMed":"8050282"},"title":"Rotavirus vaccines and vaccination potential.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The review of rotavirus vaccine development shows that many challenges remain, and priorities for future studies need to be established, and samples remaining from previous trials should be analyzed to determine epitope-specific serum and coproantibody responses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4244,"details":{"paperId":"763242f3cf8371e018b43587de9e6609f314c55d","externalIds":{"MAG":"2082229863","DOI":"10.1038/NM1297-1324","CorpusId":"5367348","PubMed":"9396600"},"title":"Rotavirus vaccines at the threshold","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["News"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The latest trials of a live, oral quadrivalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine may open the door to prevention of rotaviral diarrhea."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5671,"details":{"paperId":"12f2e79a5712bd39de8b9491cb486cb107142d22","externalIds":{"MAG":"2059258760","DOI":"10.1097/QCO.0b013e32833040a9","CorpusId":"22137203","PubMed":"19623063"},"title":"Rotavirus vaccines for the developing world","abstract":"Purpose of review The authors discuss the most relevant information in the field of rotavirus vaccines published from October 2007 to June 2009; new information on the virus, host response and disease burden that relate to our understanding of vaccine mechanisms and impact are discussed.

Despite these successes, several countries in Africa and Asia where disease burden is high have not yet implemented rotavirus vaccination at all or at a scale sufficient enough to demonstrate impact. This could be, among other reasons, due to poor vaccine coverage and the modest levels of efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccines in these resource-limited settings. Areas covered We review various factors related to the human host (malnutrition, maternally derived antibodies and breastfeeding, genetic factors, blood group, and co-administration with oral polio vaccine), rotavirus pathogen (force of infection, strain diversity and coinfections), and the environment (related to the human microbiome) which reflect complex and interconnected processes leading to diminished vaccine performance in resource-limited settings. Expert opinion Addressing the limiting factors for vaccine efficacy is needed but likely to take a long time to be resolved. An immediate solution is to increase the immunization coverage to higher values generating an overall effect of adequate proportion of protected population to reduce the prevalence of rotavirus disease. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the context? Rotavirus is contagious and causes severe diarrhea in children below 5 years of age. It caused 128,500 deaths and 258 million episodes of diarrhea in 2016. Vaccines protecting children from rotavirus are given orally and have been implemented in 109 countries and used for more than a decade. They considerably decreased the number of hospitalizations and deaths. Several Asian and African countries experience rotavirus infections in large numbers and lag behind in implementing rotavirus vaccination programs. In these countries, rotavirus vaccines only prevent a smaller percentage of severe cases. The reasons for this reduction in vaccination impact are not widely known. What is new? We reviewed the literature to identify the reasons that could explain the differences in vaccination impact worldwide. Factors that might influence the impact of vaccination include Infected children (malnutrition, breastfeeding, blood group, and co-administration with oral polio vaccine); Circulating virus(es) (force of infection, number of new strains, and coinfections with other pathogens) Environment: human microbiome (microorganisms at the surface and in the body; that could be altered by diet, method of childbirth, or hygiene). Why is this important?

This decision to develop rotavirus vaccines is predicated on the great burden associated with fatal rotavirus disease (i.e., 440,000 deaths/year), the firm scientific basis for developing live oral vaccines, the belief that increased investment in development at this time could speed the introduction of vaccines in developing countries, and the appreciation that implementation of a vaccine program should result in a measurable decrease in the number of hospitalizations and deaths associated with rotavirus disease within 2-3 years. RotaShield (Wyeth-Ayerst), the first rotavirus vaccine licensed in the United States, was withdrawn after 9 months because of a rare association of the vaccine with the development of intussusception. In the developing world, this vaccine could still have had a measurable effect, because the benefits of preventing deaths due to rotavirus disease would have been substantially greater than the rare risk of intussusception. Two live oral vaccines being prepared by GlaxoSmithKline and Merck have completed large-scale clinical trials. The GlaxoSmithKline vaccine has been licensed in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, and the Merck vaccine could be licensed in the United States within 1 year; several other candidate vaccines are in earlier stages of testing. However, many challenges remain before any of these vaccines can be incorporated into childhood immunization programs in the developing world. First, vaccine efficacy, which has already been demonstrated in children in industrialized and middle-income countries, needs to be proven in poor developing countries in Africa and Asia. The safety of vaccines with regard to the associated risk of intussusception must be demonstrated as well. Novel financing strategies will be needed to ensure that new vaccines are affordable and available in the developing world. Decision makers and parents in developing countries need to know about this disease that has little name recognition and is rarely diagnosed. Finally, for the global effort toward the prevention of rotavirus disease to be successful, special efforts will be required in India, China, and Indonesia, because one-third of all deaths due to rotavirus disease occur in these countries, and because these countries depend almost entirely on vaccines manufactured domestically.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"For the global effort toward the prevention of rotavirus disease to be successful, special efforts will be required in India, China, and Indonesia, because one-third of all deaths due to rotav virus disease occur in these countries, and because these countries depend almost entirely on vaccines manufactured domestically."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3972,"details":{"paperId":"aab42df1fd1772a678e8499b86388c2af1f9a6f3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2126953565","DOI":"10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70231-7","CorpusId":"46259464","PubMed":"18922486"},"title":"Rotavirus vaccines: viral shedding and risk of transmission.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A review of rotavirus vaccine prelicensure studies shows that viral shedding and transmission were higher with the old tetravalent rhesus rotav virus vaccine than with the current human attenuated monovalent rotvirus vaccine and the pentavalent bovine-human reassortant vaccine."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7280,"details":{"paperId":"bf186ebcfce1b6444b88c54769cc3a7d029f1a1b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2104280203","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.71.11.8707-8717.1997","CorpusId":"1561359","PubMed":"9343229"},"title":"Rotavirus virus-like particles administered mucosally induce protective immunity","abstract":"We have evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of rotavirus subunit vaccines administered by mucosal routes.

To date, 86 countries have included RV vaccines into their national immunization programs including 41 Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization eligible countries.

However, the 70-nm rotavirus (which has a characteristic morphologic appearance resembling a \"wheel\" [rota = wheel]) was soon found in worldwide studies to be the long sought after, elusive, major etiologic agent of severe diarrhea of infants and young children [6, 7]. Both viruses were detected initially by electron microscopic techniques: the Norwalk virus by immune electron microscopy using an infectious stool preparation that was reacted with a patient's convalescent serum to enable viral recognition [2]; and the rotavirus by thin-section electron microscopy of duodenal tissue obtained from pediatric patients with diarrheal illness [3].

Caulobacter crescentus produces a hexagonally arranged paracrystalline protein surface layer (S-layer) composed of a single secreted protein, RsaA, that is notably tolerant of heterologous peptide insertions while maintaining the surface-attached crystalline character. Here, a protein G IgG-binding domain, GB1, was expressed as an insertion into full-length RsaA on the cell surface to produce densely packed immunoreactive particles. GB1 insertions at five separate sites were expressed, and all bound rabbit and goat IgG, but expression levels were reduced compared to those of wild-type RsaA and poor binding to mouse IgG was noted. To remedy this, we used the 20-amino-acid Muc1 peptide derived from human mucins as a spacer, since insertions of multiple tandem repeats were well tolerated for RsaA secretion and assembly. This strategy worked remarkably well, and recombinant RsaA proteins, containing up to three GB1 domains, surrounded by Muc1 peptides, not only were secreted and assembled but did so at wild-type levels. The ability to bind IgG (including mouse IgG) increased as GB1 units were added, and those with three GB1 domains bound twice as much rabbit IgG per cell as S. aureus cells (Pansorbin). The ability of recombinant protein G-Caulobacter cells to function as immunoactive reagents was assessed in an immunoprecipitation assay using a FLAG-tagged protein and anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody; their performance was comparable to that of protein G-Sepharose beads. This work demonstrates the potential for using cells expressing recombinant RsaA/GB1 in immunoassays, especially considering that protein G-Caulobacter cells are more cost-effective than protein G beads and exhibit a broader species and IgG isotype binding range than protein A.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The potential for using cells expressing recombinant RsaA/GB1 in immunoassays is demonstrated, especially considering that protein G-Caulobacter cells are more cost-effective than protein G beads and exhibit a broader species and IgG isotype binding range than protein A."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4499,"details":{"paperId":"73de29b34a212c4ea6f64f225379236655988aa7","externalIds":{"MAG":"1758731908","DOI":"10.1039/c5ob01376c","CorpusId":"32145015","PubMed":"26464117"},"title":"S-Linked sialyloligosaccharides bearing liposomes and micelles as influenza virus inhibitors.","abstract":"An efficient, homogeneous synthesis of phospholipid conjugation of S-Neu5Acα2-6Galβ1-4GluNAcβ1-3 (3) and its 6-sulphate analogue 4 has been developed.

In this study, the binding epitope of the N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) derivatives has been characterized by saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. From this STD NMR data, it is proposed that the VP8* core recognizes an identical binding epitope in both methyl alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminide (Neu5Acalpha2Me) and the disaccharide methyl S-(alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminosyl)-(2-->6)-6-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (Neu5Ac-alpha(2,6)-S-Galbeta1Me). In the VP8*-disaccharide complex, the Neu5Ac moiety contributes to the majority of interaction with the protein, whereas the galactose moiety is solvent-exposed. Molecular dynamics calculations of the VP8*-disaccharide complex indicated that the galactose moiety is unable to adopt a conformation that is in close proximity to the protein surface. STD NMR experiments with methyl 9-O-acetyl-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminide (Neu5,9Ac(2)alpha2Me) in complex with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) VP8* revealed that both the N-acetamide and 9-O-acetate moieties are in close proximity to the Sia-binding domain, with the N-acetamide's methyl group being saturated to a larger extent, indicating a closer association with the protein. RRV VP8* does not appear to significantly recognize the unsaturated Neu5Ac derivative [2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en)].

Immunization against rotaviruses in infancy is currently the most effective and economical strategy to prevent rotavirus infection. This study evaluated the safety of a novel hexavalent rotavirus vaccine and analyzed its dose and immunogenicity. Methods This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial enrolled healthy adults, toddlers, and infants in Zhengding County, Hebei Province, northern China. 40 adults and 40 children were assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive one vaccine dose, placebo 1, and placebo 2, respectively. 120 6–12 week old infants were assigned equivalently into 3 groups. The infants in each group were assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive three doses of vaccine, placebo 1, and placebo 2, at a 28-day interval. Adverse events (AEs) until 28 days after each dose and serious adverse events (SAEs) until 6 months after the third dose were reported. Virus shedding until 14 days after each dose in infants was tested. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and seroconversion rates were measured for anti-rotavirus IgA by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The solicited and unsolicited AE frequencies and laboratory indexes were similar among the treatment groups. No vaccine-related SAEs were reported. The average percentage of rotavirus vaccine shedding in the infant vaccine groups was 5.00%. The post-3rd dose anti-rotavirus IgA antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMC) and seroconversion rate were higher in the vaccine groups than in the placebo groups.

Standard in vitro genotoxicity tests such as the bacterial reverse mutation assay and in vivo micronucleus assay were performed and no mutagenic or clastogenic potential was found. In the acute toxicity study, ICR mice were administered with riclinoctaose via gavage in 14-day studies at the level corresponding to 3000 mg/kg BW/day. In the subchronic study, the diets containing 0%, 1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0% of riclinoctaose (weight/weight) were prepared for ICR mice for 13 weeks. No test item-related adverse effects were observed in the acute and subchronic studies. No riclinoctaose-induced differences in the overall health, body weight gain, food and water consumption, hematology, blood chemistry, gross pathology, histopathology, or animal death were observed. A no-observed-adverse-effect level of 8842 mg/kg BW/day for male and 9230 mg/kg BW/day for female mice was identified for riclinoctaose when administered for 13 weeks.

We also included the following types of post-licensure analyses: case-control studies, self-controlled case series, and multivariate risk factor analyses. We conducted an electronic search of PubMed from inception through August 2013, and reviewed Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices statements, vaccine package inserts, and previously published reviews to identify studies. Scientific Information Packets were requested from vaccine manufacturers.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nWe reviewed the methodology of the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus report \"Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality\" and accepted their findings. We augmented their work with new studies and additional vaccines. For studies not included in the IOM report, we abstracted data on the presence or absence of adverse health outcomes, characteristics of patients, study design, and vaccine description, including brand, potency, dosage, timing, and formulation, where available. We excluded formulations not used in the United States. The McHarm instrument was used to evaluate the quality of adverse events collection and reporting in each study. We were unable to pool results; we rated the overall strength of evidence (SOE) as high, moderate, low, or insufficient by using guidance suggested by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for its Effective Health Care Program.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 20,478 titles were identified; after title, abstract, and full-text review, 166 studies were accepted for abstraction. The vast majority of studies either did not investigate or could not identify risk factors for adverse events (AEs) associated with vaccination. Similarly, the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported, as was information that would make independent severity determination possible.\nSOE was high for the following associations in nonpregnant adults: seasonal influenza vaccine and arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, pain at injection site; 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); and a lack of association between influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and cardiovascular events in the elderly. Risk of GBS was estimated at 1.6 excess cases per million persons vaccinated. SOE was high for the following associations in children and adolescents: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and febrile seizures in children under age 5; lack of association between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders; and varicella vaccine and disseminated Oka strain varicella zoster virus with associated complications (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis) in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies. There is moderate SOE that vaccines against rotavirus are associated with intussusception in children; risk was estimated as 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses, depending on brand.

The current formulation of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5) must be stored refrigerated at 2–8°C. A modified formulation of RV5 (RV5mp) has been developed with stability at 37°C for 7 days and an expiry extended to 36 months when stored at 2–8°C. Methods: This study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01600092; EudraCT number: 2012-001611-23) evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of RV5mp versus the currently marketed RV5 in infants. To maintain blinding, both vaccine formulations were stored refrigerated at 2–8°C for the duration of the study. Immunogenicity endpoints were (1) serum neutralizing antibody titers to human rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1A[8] and (2) proportion of subjects with a ≥3-fold rise from baseline for serum neutralizing antibody to human rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1A[8] and serum antirotavirus immunoglobulin A. Results: The RV5mp group (n = 505) and RV5 group (n = 509) had comparable safety profiles. There were no deaths and no vaccine-related serious adverse events in this study. With respect to immunogenicity, RV5mp was noninferior compared with RV5. Serum neutralizing antibody responses by country and breast-feeding status were generally consistent with the overall results.

Expression of the wild-type 3AB gene in the presence of a chromogenic beta-galactosidase substrate causes E. coli clones to stain dark blue.

In-depth study of the mechanism by which the innate immune system combats ARV infection, especially the antiviral effect mediated by interferon, is needed to prevent and contain ARV infection. In this study, ARV strain S1133 was used to artificially infect 7-day-old specific pathogen–free chickens. The results indicated that ARV rapidly proliferated in the immune organs, including the spleen, bursa of Fabricius, and thymus. The viral load peaked early in the infection and led to varying degrees of pathological damage to tissues and organs. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the mRNA levels of interferon and multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the spleen, bursa of Fabricius, and thymus were upregulated to varying degrees in the early stage of infection. Among the ISGs, IFIT5, and Mx were the most upregulated in various tissues and organs, suggesting that they are important ISGs for host resistance to ARV infection. Further investigation of the role of IFIT5 in ARV infection showed that overexpression of the IFIT5 gene inhibited ARV replication, whereas inhibition of the endogenously expressed IFIT5 gene by siRNA promoted ARV replication. IFIT5 may be a positive feedback regulator of the innate immune signaling pathways during ARV infection and may induce IFN-α production by promoting the expression of MAD5 and MAVS to exert its antiviral effect.

Total cell Ca2+ depletion has been shown to impair virus maturation, arresting this process at the membrane-enveloped intermediate form following its budding into the ER. On the other hand, rotavirus infection leads to an increase in the internal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and sequestered Ca2+ pools. We have used thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-ATPase of the ER, to release stored Ca2+ and to study its role in rotavirus morphogenesis and cytopathic effect. Thapsigargin (0.1 to 1 microM) released stored Ca2+ from MA-104 cells, as measured by chlorotetracycline fluorescence. The concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+, measured with fura2, increased in infected cells whether treated or not with thapsigargin. Infectivity was decreased dose dependently by thapsigargin (3 log units at 0.25 to 1 microM). In infected cells treated with thapsigargin, glycosylation of VP7 and NS28 was inhibited. Electron microscopy of infected cells treated with thapsigargin showed normal synthesis of viroplasm. However, only membrane-enveloped, not double-shelled, particles could be observed within the ER. The conformation of VP7 in infected cells treated with thapsigargin appeared to be altered, as suggested by decreased immunofluorescence reactivity with monoclonal antibodies to highly conformation-dependent VP7 epitopes. The progression of cell death in infected cells, as measured by penetration of ethidium bromide, was not affected by thapsigargin. These results indicate that rotavirus maturation depends on a high sequestered [Ca2+], specifically in the ER.

Rotavirus, a member of the Reoviridae family of viruses, is the most common infectious agent underlying severe diarrheal disease in children and is responsible for approximately one-third of all cases requiring hospitalization. Rotavirus enteritis results in >500,000 deaths annually in children less than 5 y according to World Health Organization estimates. Although 2 licensed oral, live, attenuated rotavirus vaccines are available internationally (Rotarix and RotaTeq) >90% of rotavirus-mediated childhood fatalities occur within developing nations due to limited access to the vaccines, sanitation concerns and insufficient availability to routine healthcare services. Clinical management for acute rotavirus enteritis largely consists of oral rehydration therapy and zinc supplementation as there are no licensed antiviral therapies approved for rotavirus infections. As rotaviruses also cause severe diarrheal disease in young animals, including livestock species, they also represent a considerable threat to global livestock health with the potential for severe economic consequences. Increased clarity regarding the relation between rotavirus molecular pathogenesis and pathophysiology could help inform current patient care modalities. Further, the identification of key molecular determinants involved in the pathophysiology of severe rotavirus infections may also assist drug discovery and development strategies. To this end there have been considerable efforts over the past 2 decades to identify the role of host-rotavirus interactions in rotavirus pathogenesis. In particular, many efforts have focused on how rotaviruses usurp host cell innate immune responses and the ubiquitous network of pattern recognition receptors (PRR). Rotaviruses are capable of suppressing interferon (IFN) responses during the early stages of infection. Indeed, prophylactic administration of IFN restricts rotavirus replication both in vitro and in vivo. Previous investigations have demonstrated that rotavirus infection does not result in PRR-mediated activation of IFNb suggesting that viral-centric mechanisms exist to counteract these responses. The rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP1 mediates the degradation of multiple interferon regulatory factor (IRF) members including IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7. Further, it has also been suggested that NSP1 inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Recent investigations have also demonstrated that NSP1 may also downregulate innate immune responses through direct interactions with PRRs as NSP1 can downregulate retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors. In addition, there has been concerted efforts in the investigation of rotavirusmediated regulation of host cell protein translation. It has been proposed that NSP3 modifies the intracellular localization of polyA-binding protein (PABP) by impairing its interaction with eIF4GI resulting in repression of host translation processes and accentuation of viral translation. Interestingly, recent work by Halasz et al. have demonstrated that rotavirus binding/entry and replication are increased via the induction of a2b1 and b2 integrin expression through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism.

To develop serological assays for bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) and to determine the cross-reactivity of BoNV with human noroviruses, we generated two recombinant baculoviruses, rCV186-OH and rJNCV, to express the capsid genes of Bo/CV186-OH/00/US (Norovirus genogroup III [GIII], genotype 2 [GIII/2]). rCV186-OH expressed the expected 57-kDa capsid protein, but rJNCV expressed a truncated capsid protein of 35 kDa. Sequence analysis of rJNCV identified a single nucleotide deletion in the P domain of the capsid gene, which introduced a stop codon at amino acid 323. The recombinant capsid protein produced by rCV186-OH but not that produced by rJNCV self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) similar to native BoNV. An antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and antigen-capture ELISA (Ag-ELISA) detected serum antibody and antigen, respectively, from calves infected with Bo/CV186-OH/00/US but not antibodies or antigens to other enteric viruses. In other tests of the GIII/2 BoNV Ag-ELISA, no cross-reactivity was observed with VLPs from one GI and four GII human noroviruses and porcine sapovirus Cowden strain.

Reovirus binds to cell surface glycans, junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A), and the Nogo-1 receptor (depending on the cell type) and enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Within the endocytic compartment, reovirus undergoes stepwise disassembly, which is followed by release of the transcriptionally active viral core into the cytoplasm. In a small-molecule screen to identify host mediators of reovirus infection, we found that treatment of cells with 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT), a prototype serotonin receptor agonist, diminished reovirus cytotoxicity. 5-NT also blocked reovirus infection. In contrast, treatment of cells with methiothepin mesylate, a serotonin antagonist, enhanced infection by reovirus. 5-NT did not alter cell surface expression of JAM-A or attachment of reovirus to cells. However, 5-NT altered the distribution of early endosomes with a concomitant impairment of reovirus transit to late endosomes and a delay in reovirus disassembly. Consistent with an inhibition of viral disassembly, 5-NT treatment did not alter infection by in vitro-generated infectious subvirion particles, which bind to JAM-A but bypass a requirement for proteolytic uncoating in endosomes to infect cells. We also found that treatment of cells with 5-NT decreased the infectivity of alphavirus chikungunya virus and coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. These data suggest that serotonin receptor signaling influences cellular activities that regulate entry of diverse virus families and provides a new, potentially broad-spectrum target for antiviral drug development. IMPORTANCE Identification of well-characterized small molecules that modulate viral infection can accelerate development of antiviral therapeutics while also providing new tools to increase our understanding of the cellular processes that underlie virus-mediated cell injury. We conducted a small-molecule screen to identify compounds capable of inhibiting cytotoxicity caused by reovirus, a prototype double-stranded RNA virus. We found that 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT) impairs reovirus infection by altering viral transport during cell entry. Remarkably, 5-NT also inhibits infection by an alphavirus and a coronavirus. The antiviral properties of 5-NT suggest that serotonin receptor signaling is an important regulator of infection by diverse virus families and illuminate a potential new drug target.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT) impairs reovirus infection by altering viral transport during cell entry and inhibits infection by an alphavirus and a coronavirus."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7664,"details":{"paperId":"fee9dacbdc6ea63605e6e20d4e894c71f1e9b3c3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2107832085","DOI":"10.1136/gut.2003.033563","CorpusId":"14718283","PubMed":"15194642"},"title":"Serotonin and vasoactive intestinal peptide antagonists attenuate rotavirus diarrhoea","abstract":"Background and aims: The mechanisms underlying intestinal secretion in rotavirus diarrhoea remain to be established. We previously reported that rotavirus evokes intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion by activation of the enteric nervous system. We now report that antagonists for the 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor (5-HT3) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor, but not antagonists for 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptor or the muscarinic receptor, attenuate rotavirus induced diarrhoea. Methods: Neurotransmitter antagonists were administered to wild-type or neurokinin 1 receptor knockout mice infected with homologous (EDIM) or heterologous (RRV) rotavirus. Results: While RRV infected mice had diarrhoea for 3.3 (0.2) days (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.04–3.56), the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (granisetron) and the VIP receptor antagonist (4Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17)-VIP both reduced the total number of days of RRV induced diarrhoea to 2.1 (0.3) (95% CI 1.31–2.9) (p<0.01). EDIM infected mice treated with granisetron had a significantly shorter duration of diarrhoea (5.6 (0.4) days) compared with untreated mice (8.0 (0.4) days; p<0.01). Experiments with neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists suggest that this receptor may possibly be involved in the secretory response to rotavirus.

It is an important cause of death in children younger than 5 years worldwide. Shenling baizhu powder (SBP), a classic traditional Chinese formulation, is one of the most popularly prescribed medicines for digestive diseases. Clinical studies have revealed the protective effects of SBP on RVE. However, the potential mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-rotavirus effect of SBP and its mechanism, focusing on the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. Our results demonstrated that, based on the inhibition of the virus-induced cytopathic effect in Caco-2 cells, the concentration for 50% of maximal effect (EC50) and selectivity index (SI) of SBP for RV-SA11 in the serum were 5.911% and 11.63, respectively. A total of 219 active compounds with oral bioavailability ≥30% and drug-likeness ≥ 0.18 were selected from the 10 ingredients present in the formulation of SBP, which acted on 471 potential targets. A total of 226 target genes of RVE were obtained from the GeneCards database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that there was a close interaction between 44 common targets of SBP and RVE. The results of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that SBP acted on RVE through various inflammatory pathways and the intestinal immune network. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of SBP on TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro. After infection with RV- SA11, the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB mRNA and protein increased significantly, which could be abolished by SBP treatment.

Treatment with SBP partly reversed the changes of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, while further increased the level of IFN-β. In conclusion, our study revealed that SBP can significantly inhibit rotavirus replication and proliferation in vitro.

Our previous studies indicate that rotavirus infection is an initiator in the pathogenesis of experimental biliary atresia (BA) through the induction of increased nuclear factor-kappaB and abnormal activation of the osteopontin inflammation pathway. In the setting of rotavirus infection, rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) serves as an important immunogen, viral protein 7 (VP7) is necessary in rotavirus maturity and viral protein 4 (VP4) is a virulence determiner. The purpose of the current study is to clarify the roles of NSP4, VP7 and VP4 in the pathogenesis of experimental BA. Primary cultured extrahepatic biliary epithelia were infected with Rotavirus (mmu18006). Small interfering RNA targeting NSP4, VP7 or VP4 was transfected before rotavirus infection both in vitro and in vivo. We analyzed the incidence of BA, morphological change, morphogenesis of viral particles and viral mRNA and protein expression. The in vitro experiments showed NSP4 silencing decreased the levels of VP7 and VP4, reduced viral particles and decreased cytopathic effect. NSP4-positive cells had strongly positive expression of integrin subunit α2. Silencing of VP7 or VP4 partially decreased epithelial injury. Animal experiments indicated after NSP4 silencing, mouse pups had lower incidence of BA than after VP7 or VP4 silencing. However, 33.3% of VP4-silenced pups (N = 6) suffered BA and 50% of pups (N = 6) suffered biliary injury after VP7 silencing. Hepatic injury was decreased after NSP4 or VP4 silencing.

We describe here a means to display anti-infective agents on the surface of a probiotic bacterium. Because of their stability and versatility, VHHs, the variable domains of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies, have potential as components of novel agents to treat or prevent enteric infectious disease. We isolated and characterized VHHs targeting several enteropathogenic Escherichia.coli (EPEC) virulence factors: flagellin (Fla), which is required for bacterial motility and promotes colonization; both intimin and the translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which together play key roles in attachment to enterocytes; and E. coli secreted protein A (EspA), an essential component of the type III secretion system (T3SS) that is required for virulence. Several VHHs that recognize Fla, intimin, or Tir blocked function in vitro. The probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) produces on the bacterial surface curli fibers, which are the major proteinaceous component of E. coli biofilms. A subset of Fla-, intimin-, or Tir-binding VHHs, as well as VHHs that recognize either a T3SS of another important bacterial pathogen (Shigella flexneri), a soluble bacterial toxin (Shiga toxin or Clostridioides difficile toxin TcdA), or a major surface antigen of an important eucaryotic pathogen (Cryptosporidium parvum) were fused to CsgA, the major curli fiber subunit. Scanning electron micrographs indicated CsgA-VHH fusions were assembled into curli fibers on the EcN surface, and Congo Red binding indicated that these recombinant curli fibers were produced at high levels. Ectopic production of these VHHs conferred on EcN the cognate binding activity and, in the case of anti-Shiga toxin, was neutralizing. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of the curli-based pathogen sequestration strategy described herein and contribute to the development of novel VHH-based gut therapeutics. Author Summary Enteric pathogens are the causative agents of diarrheal disease – a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While treatment and prevention options such as drugs or vaccines exist for some pathogens, their efficacy and availability are often limited. New therapeutic strategies are therefore needed, especially inexpensive agents in low-income countries where enteric disease burdens are highest. One promising avenue for novel treatments uses VHHs – highly stable, well-expressed, antibody domains derived from camelid species such as llamas and alpacas. The small size, high stability and simple structure of these antibody fragments enables their streamlined production by bacteria such as E. coli, potentially reducing cost and improving scalability. In this work, we describe the development of VHHs targeting multiple virulence factor proteins of pathogenic E. coli and other leading causes of diarrheal disease. These VHHs provide new tools for the research community and may serve as promising components of agents that prevent or treat pathogen infections. Towards that goal, we engineered a novel system in which the probiotic, mucus-establishing bacterial strain E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is used to express and display VHHs at high density on its surface. By demonstrating the ability of these engineered EcN to bind to pathogens, we provide a first step toward using such probiotics as a cheap, simple, and effective treatment for enteric pathogen infections.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The development of VHHs targeting multiple virulence factor proteins of pathogenic E. coli and other leading causes of diarrheal disease is described, which demonstrate the potential of the curli-based pathogen sequestration strategy described herein and contribute to the development of novel VHH-based gut therapeutics."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9223,"details":{"paperId":"5bd630c160bfb447a7ca43271f717e834ca9dc60","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"5733491","MAG":"2772437484","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2017.01802","CorpusId":"10166963","PubMed":"29326699"},"title":"Single-Domain Antibodies As Therapeutics against Human Viral Diseases","abstract":"In full-size formats, monoclonal antibodies have been highly successful as therapeutics against cancer and immune diseases.

In addition, VHHs can be equipped with effector functions, for example to guide components of the immune system with high precision to sites of viral infection.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review focuses on VHH formats that have been developed to combat viruses including influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9165,"details":{"paperId":"bf2f31edcc26de2afbeb50bcea01017802f661bc","externalIds":{"MAG":"3092050929","DOI":"10.3389/978-2-88945-432-7","CorpusId":"225162593"},"title":"Single-Domain Antibodies: Biology, Engineering and Emerging Applications","abstract":"Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) represent the minimal antigen binding-competent form of the immunoglobulin domain and have unique properties and applications.

DNA microarray experiments demonstrate that Hsp72 is one of the most highly upregulated genes in response to LGG-CM treatment. Real-time PCR and electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirm that regulation of Hsp induction is at least in part transcriptional in nature, involving heat shock factor-1. Although Hsps are not induced for hours after exposure, transient exposure to LGG-CM is sufficient to initiate the signal for Hsp induction, suggesting that signal transduction pathways may be involved. Experiments confirm that LGG-CM modulates the activity of certain signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells by activating MAP kinases.

The molecules are commonly used to study the function of the target proteins (i.e., their antigens). The intrabody technology is an attractive alternative to the generation of gene-targeted knockout animals, and complements knockdown techniques such as RNAi, miRNA and small molecule inhibitors, by-passing various limitations and disadvantages of these methods. The advantages of intrabodies include very high specificity for the target, the possibility to knock down several protein isoforms by one intrabody and targeting of specific splice variants or even post-translational modifications. Different types of intrabodies must be designed to target proteins at different locations, typically either in the cytoplasm, in the nucleus or in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Most straightforward is the use of intrabodies retained in the ER (ER intrabodies) to knock down the function of proteins passing the ER, which disturbs the function of members of the membrane or plasma proteomes. More effort is needed to functionally knock down cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins because in this case antibodies need to provide an inhibitory effect and must be able to fold in the reducing milieu of the cytoplasm. In this review, we present a broad overview of intrabody technology, as well as applications both of ER and cytoplasmic intrabodies, which have yielded valuable insights in the biology of many targets relevant for drug development, including α-synuclein, TAU, BCR-ABL, ErbB-2, EGFR, HIV gp120, CCR5, IL-2, IL-6, β-amyloid protein and p75NTR.

A neutralizing, cross-reactive VP4-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), 2G4, was used to probe the protein-protein interactions. The VP4 specificity of 2G4 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. MAb 2G4 reacted with both standard (SA11-C13) and variant rotavirus SA11 (SA11-4F) but did not react with bovine rotavirus B223 as determined by plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). When a panel of SA11-4F/B223 and SA11-Cl3/B223 reassortants in purified or crude lysate form that had been grown in the presence or absence of trypsin was analyzed with MAb 2G4 by PRN and ELISA, the results with some reassortants were unexpected. That is, MAb 2G4 reacted with VP4 of SA11 parental origin (4F or C13) when it was assembled into capsids with the homologous SA11 VP7 but failed to react with VP4 of SA11 assembled into capsids with heterologous B223 VP7. Conversely, MAb 2G4 failed to react with VP4 of B223 parental origin when it was assembled into capsids with homologous B223 VP7 but did react with B223 VP4 assembled into capsids with the heterologous SA11 VP7. Similar reactivity was observed when 2G4 was used to immunoprecipitate purified double-shelled virions. When soluble unassembled viral proteins were analyzed by ELISA, the 2G4 reactive pattern was as predicted from the parental origin of VP4. That is, 2G4 reacted with the soluble VP4 of reassortants having VP4 from SA11-Cl3 or SA11-4F and failed to react with VP4 of B223 origin, regardless of the origin of VP7. PRN and ELISA results obtained with nonglycosylated viruses revealed that the unexpected reactivity of 2G4 with virus particles was not the result of differential glycosylation of VP7 and epitope masking. These results indicate that the 2G4 epitope existed in the soluble form of VP4 encoded by SA11-Cl3 or SA11-4F but not in soluble B223 VP4.

It is its unique biochemical composition that renders MFGM with some beneficial biological activities, such as anti-adhesive effects toward pathogens. However, a prerequisite for the putative bioactivity of MFGM is its stability during gastrointestinal digestion. We, therefore, subjected MFGM material, isolated from raw milk, to an in vitro enzymatic gastrointestinal digestion. Sodium dodecyl sulfate PAGE, in combination with 2 staining methods, Coomassie Blue and periodic acid Schiff staining, was used to evaluate polypeptide patterns of the digest, whereas mass spectrometry was used to confirm the presence of specific MFGM proteins. Generally, it was observed that glycoproteins showed higher resistance to endogenous proteases compared with non-glycosylated proteins. Mucin 1 displayed the highest resistance to digestion and a considerable part of this protein was still detected at its original molecular weight after gastric and small intestine digestion. Cluster of differentiation 36 was also quite resistant to pepsin. A significant part of periodic acid Schiff 6/7 survived the gastric digestion, provided that the lipid moiety was not removed from the MFGM material. Overall, MFGM glycoproteins are generally more resistant to gastrointestinal digestion than serum milk proteins and the presence of lipids, besides glycosylation, may protect MFGM glycoproteins from gastrointestinal digestion.

An immune transcriptome comprising 219,765 transcripts and an overview of the mussel miRNome based on 5,175,567 non-redundant miRNA reads were obtained. The expression analyses showed opposite results in the transcriptome and miRNome; LPS was the stimulus that triggered the highest transcriptomic response, with 648 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while poly I:C was the stimulus that triggered the highest miRNA response, with 240 DE miRNAs. Our results reveal a powerful immune response to LPS as well as activation of certain immunometabolism- and ageing/senescence-related processes in response to all the immune challenges. Poly I:C exhibited powerful stimulating properties in mussels, since it triggered the highest miRNomic response and modulated important genes related to energy demand; these effects could be related to the stronger activation of these hemocytes (increased phagocytosis, increased NO synthesis, and increased velocity and accumulated distance). The transcriptome results suggest that after LPS stimulation, pathogen recognition, homeostasis and cell survival processes were activated, and phagocytosis was induced by LPS. β-glucans elicited a response related to cholesterol metabolism, which is important during the immune response, and it was the only stimulus that induced the synthesis of ROS. These results suggest a specific and distinct response of hemocytes to each stimulus from a transcriptomic, miRNomic, and functional point of view.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A powerful immune response to LPS is revealed as well as activation of certain immunometabolism- and ageing/senescence-related processes in response to all the immune challenges."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9706,"details":{"paperId":"2597a10a078d8652b5c830241505bda6e9fbd923","externalIds":{"MAG":"2953907839","PubMedCentral":"6669682","DOI":"10.3390/v11070591","CorpusId":"195771261","PubMed":"31261806"},"title":"Storage-Dependent Generation of Potent Anti-ZIKV Activity in Human Breast Milk","abstract":"Zika virus (ZIKV) causes congenital neurologic birth defects, notably microcephaly, and has been associated with other serious complications in adults.

The viral titer of milk that was spiked with ZIKV decreased considerably upon storage at 37 °C for 8 h, was lost entirely after 2 days of 4 °C storage, but was not affected at −20 °C.

We report here that the capsid of a major avian pathogen, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), can accommodate heterologous proteins to induce protective immunity. The structural units of the ∼70-nm-diameter T=13 IBDV capsid are trimers of VP2, which is made as a precursor (pVP2). The pVP2 C-terminal domain has an amphipathic α helix that controls VP2 polymorphism. In the absence of the VP3 scaffolding protein, 466-residue pVP2 intermediates bearing this α helix assemble into genuine VLPs only when expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag (the HT-VP2-466 protein). HT-VP2-466 capsids are optimal for protein insertion, as they are large enough (cargo space, ∼78,000 nm3) and are assembled from a single protein. We explored HT-VP2-466-based chimeric capsids initially using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The VLP assembly yield was efficient when we coexpressed EGFP-HT-VP2-466 and HT-VP2-466 from two recombinant baculoviruses. The native EGFP structure (∼240 copies/virion) was successfully inserted in a functional form, as VLPs were fluorescent, and three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy showed that the EGFP molecules incorporated at the inner capsid surface. Immunization of mice with purified EGFP-VLPs elicited anti-EGFP antibodies. We also inserted hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix (M2) protein epitopes derived from the mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 influenza virus and engineered several HA- and M2-derived chimeric capsids. Mice immunized with VLPs containing the HA stalk, an M2 fragment, or both antigens developed full protection against viral challenge. IMPORTANCE Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multimeric protein cages that mimic the infectious virus capsid and are potential candidates as nonliving vaccines that induce long-lasting protection. Chimeric VLPs can display or include foreign antigens, which could be a conserved epitope to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies or several variable epitopes effective against a large number of viral strains. We report the biochemical, structural, and immunological characterization of chimeric VLPs derived from infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), an important poultry pathogen. To test the potential of IBDV VLPs as a vaccine vehicle, we used the enhanced green fluorescent protein and two fragments derived from the hemagglutinin and the M2 matrix protein of the human murine-adapted influenza virus. The IBDV capsid protein fused to influenza virus peptides formed assemblies able to protect mice against viral challenge.

With a combination treatment, i.e., the addition of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2′FL, the effect of inhibition was increased.

We showed that the Nanobodies bound on the side (Nano-7 and Nano-62) and top (Nano-94) of the capsid-protruding (P) domain using X-ray crystallography. Nano-7 and Nano-62 bound at a similar region on the P domain, but the orientations of these two Nanobodies clashed with the shell (S) domain and neighboring P domains on intact particles. This finding suggested that the P domains on the particles should shift in order for Nano-7 and Nano-62 to bind to intact particles. Interestingly, both Nano-7 and Nano-94 were capable of blocking norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) from binding to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which are important cofactors for norovirus infection. Previously, we showed that the GI.1 HBGA pocket could be blocked with the soluble human milk oligosaccharide 2-fucosyllactose (2′FL). In the current study, we showed that a combined treatment of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2′FL enhanced the blocking potential with an additive (Nano-7) or synergistic (Nano-94) effect. We also found that GII Nanobodies with 2′FL also enhanced inhibition. The Nanobody inhibition likely occurred by different mechanisms, including particle aggregation or particle disassembly, whereas 2′FL blocked the HBGA binding site. Overall, these new data showed that the positive effect of the addition of 2′FL was not limited to a single mode of action of Nanobodies or to a single norovirus genogroup. IMPORTANCE The discovery of vulnerable regions on norovirus particles is instrumental in the development of effective inhibitors, particularly for GI noroviruses that are genetically diverse. Analysis of these GI.1-specific Nanobodies has shown that similar to GII norovirus particles, the GI particles have vulnerable regions. The only known cofactor region, the HBGA binding pocket, represents the main target for inhibition. With a combination treatment, i.e., the addition of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2′FL, the effect of inhibition was increased. Therefore, combination drug treatments might offer a better approach to combat norovirus infections, especially since the GI genotypes are highly diverse and are continually changing the capsid landscape, and few conserved epitopes have so far been identified.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A combined treatment of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2′FL enhanced the blocking potential with an additive (Nano-7) or synergistic (N nano-94) effect, and showed that the positive effect of the addition of 1′FL was not limited to a single mode of action of Nanobodies or to asingle norovirus genogroup."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4821,"details":{"paperId":"d32f14973cf8fcf5bdd3e0b8c2012dc899e34153","externalIds":{"MAG":"1983132913","DOI":"10.1074/JBC.M205964200","CorpusId":"40261695","PubMed":"12401805"},"title":"Structural Comparisons of Empty and Full Cytoplasmic Polyhedrosis Virus","abstract":"Viruses in the family Reoviridae are capable of transcription within the intact capsids.

The structure of the empty CPV reveals a density attributed to the transcription enzyme complex, which is attached to the internal surface of the capsid shell below each of the 12 turrets.

The σ1 protein is also the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we present a structural and functional characterization of two neutralizing antibodies that target σ1 of serotype 1 (T1) and serotype 3 (T3) reoviruses. The crystal structures revealed that each antibody engages its cognate σ1 protein within the head domain via epitopes distinct from the JAM-A-binding site. Surface plasmon resonance and cell-binding assays indicated that both antibodies likely interfere with JAM-A engagement by steric hindrance. To define the interplay between the carbohydrate receptor and antibody binding, we conducted hemagglutination inhibition assays using virions and ISVPs. The glycan-binding site of T1 σ1 is located in the head domain and is partly occluded by the bound Fab in the crystal structure. The T1-specific antibody inhibited hemagglutination by virions and ISVPs, probably via direct interference with glycan engagement. In contrast to T1 σ1, the carbohydrate-binding site of T3 σ1 is located in the tail domain, distal to the antibody epitope. The T3-specific antibody inhibited hemagglutination by T3 virions but not ISVPs, indicating that the antibody- and glycan-binding sites in σ1 are in closer spatial proximity on virions than on ISVPs. Our results provide direct evidence for a structural rearrangement of σ1 during virion-to-ISVP conversion and contribute new information about the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of reovirus. IMPORTANCE Virus attachment proteins mediate binding to host cell receptors, serve critical functions in cell and tissue tropism, and are often targeted by the neutralizing antibody response. The structural investigation of antibody-antigen complexes can provide valuable information for understanding the molecular basis of virus neutralization. Studies with enveloped viruses, such as HIV and influenza virus, have helped to define sites of vulnerability and guide vaccination strategies. By comparison, less is known about antibody binding to nonenveloped viruses. Here, we structurally investigated two neutralizing antibodies that bind the attachment protein σ1 of reovirus. Furthermore, we characterized the neutralization efficiency, the binding affinity for σ1, and the effect of the antibodies on reovirus receptor engagement. Our analysis defines reovirus interactions with two neutralizing antibodies, allows us to propose a mechanism by which they block virus infection, and provides evidence for a conformational change in the σ1 protein during viral cell entry.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results provide direct evidence for a structural rearrangement of σ1 during virion-to-ISVP conversion and contribute new information about the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of reovirus."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":134,"details":{"paperId":"599140c7146aee96bfe9b25834fcc2a366c63c4d","externalIds":{"MAG":"2006026087","DOI":"10.1002/BIP.10509","CorpusId":"36887175","PubMed":"14648762"},"title":"Structural alterations of enkephalins in the presence of GM1 ganglioside micelles","abstract":"The enkephalins are endogenous neurotransmitters and bind with high affinity at the δ‐receptor.

P. falciparum EBA-175 (PfEBA-175) engages the host receptor Glycophorin A (GpA) during invasion and is a leading vaccine candidate. Antibodies that recognize PfEBA-175 can prevent parasite growth, although not all antibodies are inhibitory. Here, using x-ray crystallography, small-angle x-ray scattering and functional studies, we report the structural basis and mechanism for inhibition by two PfEBA-175 antibodies. Structures of each antibody in complex with the PfEBA-175 receptor binding domain reveal that the most potent inhibitory antibody, R217, engages critical GpA binding residues and the proposed dimer interface of PfEBA-175. A second weakly inhibitory antibody, R218, binds to an asparagine-rich surface loop. We show that the epitopes identified by structural studies are critical for antibody binding. Together, the structural and mapping studies reveal distinct mechanisms of action, with R217 directly preventing receptor binding while R218 allows for receptor binding. Using a direct receptor binding assay we show R217 directly blocks GpA engagement while R218 does not. Our studies elaborate on the complex interaction between PfEBA-175 and GpA and highlight new approaches to targeting the molecular mechanism of P. falciparum invasion of erythrocytes.

There are no vaccines or antiviral therapies against HAstV disease. Several lines of evidence point to the presence of protective antibodies in healthy adults as a mechanism governing protection against reinfection by HAstV. However, development of anti-HAstV therapies is hampered by the gap in knowledge of protective antibody epitopes on the HAstV capsid surface. Here, we report the structure of the HAstV capsid spike domain bound to the neutralizing monoclonal antibody PL-2. The antibody uses all six complementarity-determining regions to bind to a quaternary epitope on each side of the dimeric capsid spike. We provide evidence that the HAstV capsid spike is a receptor-binding domain and that the antibody neutralizes HAstV by blocking virus attachment to cells. We identify patches of conserved amino acids that overlap the antibody epitope and may comprise a receptor-binding site. Our studies provide a foundation for the development of therapies to prevent and treat HAstV diarrheal disease. IMPORTANCE Human astroviruses (HAstVs) infect nearly every person in the world during childhood and cause diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. Despite the prevalence of this virus, little is known about how antibodies in healthy adults protect them against reinfection. Here, we determined the crystal structure of a complex of the HAstV capsid protein and a virus-neutralizing antibody. We show that the antibody binds to the outermost spike domain of the capsid, and we provide evidence that the antibody blocks virus attachment to human cells. Importantly, our findings suggest that a subunit-based vaccine focusing the immune system on the HAstV capsid spike domain could be effective in protecting children against HAstV disease.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The crystal structure of a complex of the HAstV capsid protein and a virus-neutralizing antibody is determined and it is suggested that a subunit-based vaccine focusing the immune system on the capsid spike domain could be effective in protecting children againstHAstV disease."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6138,"details":{"paperId":"3b757f3517af1c04cfaca486e08ac06bd7c8baf4","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4356365","MAG":"2030831262","DOI":"10.1107/S1399004714027734","CorpusId":"1251490","PubMed":"25760604"},"title":"Structure of a highly acidic β-lactamase from the moderate halophile Chromohalobacter sp. 560 and the discovery of a Cs+-selective binding site","abstract":"The tertiary structure of a β-lactamase derived from the halobacterium Chromohalobacter sp. 560 (HaBLA) was determined by X-ray crystallography.

Species D human adenovirus type 37 (HAdV-D37) is a major cause of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) and infects target cells by interacting with sialic acid (SA)-containing glycans via the fiber knob domain of the viral fiber protein. HAdV-D37 also interacts with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), but the outcome of this interaction remains unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular requirements of HAdV-D37 fiber knob:GAG interactions using a GAG microarray and demonstrated that fiber knob interacts with a broad range of sulfated GAGs. These interactions were corroborated in cell-based assays and by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Removal of heparan sulfate (HS) and sulfate groups from human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells by heparinase III and sodium chlorate treatments, respectively, reduced HAdV-D37 binding to cells. Remarkably, removal of HS by heparinase III enhanced the virus infection. Our results suggest that interaction of HAdV-D37 with sulfated GAGs in secretions and on plasma membranes prevents/delays the virus binding to SA-containing receptors and inhibits subsequent infection. We also found abundant HS in the basement membrane of the human corneal epithelium, which may act as a barrier to sub-epithelial infection.

A major impact on hospitalization for all-cause gastroenteritis was observed also. Background Rotavirus vaccination with exclusive use of RotaTeq was added to the National Immunization Programme (NIP) of Finland in September 2009. The objective of our study was to estimate the effectiveness and impact of RotaTeq after 4 years of follow-up. Methods Between 2009 and 2013, we conducted a prospective surveillance study of children aged <16 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and admitted in 2 hospitals in Finland. Rotavirus and other gastroenteritis viruses were detected in stool samples by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The effectiveness of RotaTeq was investigated by using a case-control design; wild-type rotavirus-positive children were classified as “cases” and rotavirus-negative children as “controls.” Hospital discharge records were used to estimate the impact of RotaTeq on rotavirus-associated AGE (RV-AGE) and all-cause AGE (AC-AGE) hospitalizations of age-eligible children in the NIP by comparing the prevaccination (2001–2006) and post-NIP seasons (2009–2013). Results The crude estimate of the effectiveness of RotaTeq to prevent RV-AGE hospitalization in NIP age-eligible children was 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%–98.4%). No change in prevalent wild-type rotavirus genotypes was observed. Vaccine-derived rotaviruses were detected in 8% of the children with RV-AGE, with a probable causal association in 2 children. Hospital discharge records revealed that RV-AGE and AC-AGE hospitalizations in children aged <16 years decreased in the two post-NIP seasons by 79% and 58%, respectively, compared to those in the prevaccination seasons.

This is mainly because the quantities of human milk oligosaccharides required for clinical trials have been unavailable. Recently, clinical studies have tested the potential beneficial effects of feeding infants formula containing 2'-fucosyllactose, which is the most abundant oligosaccharide in human milk. These studies have opened this field for further well-designed studies, which are required to fully understand the role of human milk oligosaccharides. However, one of the most striking features of human milk is its diversity of oligosaccharides, with over 200 identified to date. It may be that a mixture of oligosaccharides is even more beneficial to infants than a single structure.

It was here that we further reported the synthesis and anti-influenza activity of novel sialic acid (C-5 and C-9)-pentacyclic triterpene conjugates.

Two conjugates (26 and 42) showed strong cytotoxicity to MDCK cells in the CellTiter-Glo assay at a concentration of 100 μM. However, they showed no significant cytotoxicity to HL-60, Hela, and A549 cell lines in MTT assay under the concentration of 10 μM (except compound 42 showed weak cytotoxicity to HL-60 cell line (10 μM, ~53%)).

Our results demonstrate that the histidine-tagged protein does not escape the accumulation in the inclusion bodies, and that SUMO is largely superior to the thioredoxin-fusion tag in enhancing the expression and solubility of VP6 protein. Moreover, the VP6 protein produced according to the SUMO fusion tag displays well-known assembly properties, as observed in both transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images, giving rise to either VP6 trimers, 60 nm spherical virus-like particles, or nanotubes a few microns long. This different quaternary organization of VP6 shows a higher level of immunogenicity for the elongated structures with respect to the spheres or the protein trimers.

Peptides were incorporated into gene delivery formulations with the cationic lipid Lipofectin and plasmid DNA and shown to confer a high degree of transfection efficiency and specificity in 1HAEo-cells. Improved transfection efficiency and specificity was also observed in human endothelial cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Therefore, on the basis of clone frequency after biopanning, cell binding affinity, peptide sequence conservation and pathogenic similarity, we have identified 3 novel peptide families and 5 specific peptides that have the potential for gene transfer to respiratory epithelium in vivo as well as providing useful in vitro transfection reagents for primary human cell types of scientific and commercial interest.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"On the basis of clone frequency after biopanning, cell binding affinity, peptide sequence conservation and pathogenic similarity, 3 novel peptide families and 5 specific peptides that have the potential for gene transfer to respiratory epithelium in vivo are identified, providing useful in vitro transfection reagents for primary human cell types of scientific and commercial interest."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9746,"details":{"paperId":"2c3333d1fd04d2b2e5628833812c91121f87cc0b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7910953","DOI":"10.3390/v13020155","CorpusId":"231711664","PubMed":"33494515"},"title":"Targeted Profiling of Immunological Genes during Norovirus Replication in Human Intestinal Enteroids","abstract":"Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide.

Marek’s disease virus (MDV) is a herpesvirus that causes deadly lymphoma and has been linked to alterations of lipid metabolism in MDV-infected chickens. However, the role of lipid metabolism in MDV replication is largely unknown. We demonstrate here that infection of primary chicken embryonic fibroblast with MDV activates de novo lipogenesis, which is required for virus replication. In contrast, activation of Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) reduced MDV titer, while inhibition of FAO moderately increased virus replication. Thus optimized virus replication occurs if synthetized fatty acids are not used for generation of energy in the infected cells, and they are likely converted to lipid compounds, which are important for virus replication. We showed that infection with MDV activates COX-2/PGE2α pathway and increases the biosynthesis of PGE2α, a lipid mediator generated from arachidonic acid. Inhibition of COX-2 or PGE2α receptors, namely EP2 and EP4 receptors, reduced MDV titer, indicating that COX-2/PGE2α pathway are involved in virus replication. Our data show that the FA synthesis pathway inhibitors reduce COX-2 expression level and PGE2α synthesis in MDV infected cells, arguing that there is a direct link between virus-induced fatty acid synthesis and activation of COX-2/PGE2α pathway. This notion was confirmed by the results showing that PGE2α can restore MDV replication in the presence of the FA synthesis pathway inhibitors.

Typically monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are administered in large doses, either directly or indirectly into the circulation, via a systemic route which is well suited for disseminated ailments. Diseases confined within a specific localized tissue, however, may be treated more effectively and at reduced cost by a delivery system which targets directly the affected area. To explore the advantages of the local administration of antibodies, we reviewed current alternative, non-systemic delivery approaches which are in clinical use, being trialed or developed. These less conventional approaches comprise: (a) local injections, (b) topical and (c) peroral administration routes. Local delivery includes intra-ocular injections into the vitreal humor (i.e. Ranibizumab for age-related macular degeneration), subconjunctival injections (e.g. Bevacizumab for corneal neovascularization), intra-articular joint injections (i.e. anti-TNF alpha antibody for persistent inflammatory monoarthritis) and intratumoral or peritumoral injections (e.g. Ipilimumab for cancer). A range of other strategies, such as the local use of antibacterial antibodies, are also presented. Local injections of antibodies utilize doses which range from 1/10th to 1/100th of the required systemic dose therefore reducing both side-effects and treatment costs. In addition, any therapeutic antibody escaping from the local site of disease into the systemic circulation is immediately diluted within the large blood volume, further lowering the potential for unwanted effects. Needle-free topical application routes become an option when the condition is restricted locally to an external surface. The topical route may potentially be utilized in the form of eye drops for infections or corneal neovascularization or be applied to diseased skin for psoriasis, dermatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, antibiotic resistant bacterial infections or ulcerated wounds. Diseases confined to the gastrointestinal tract can be targeted directly by applying antibody via the injection-free peroral route. The gastrointestinal tract is unusual in that its natural immuno-tolerant nature ensures the long-term safety of repeatedly ingesting heterologous antiserum or antibody materials. Without the stringent regulatory, purity and clean room requirements of manufacturing parenteral (injectable) antibodies, production costs are minimal, with the potential for more direct low-cost targeting of gastrointestinal diseases, especially with those caused by problematic antibiotic resistant or toxigenic bacteria (e.g. Clostridium difficile, Helicobacter pylori), viruses (e.g. rotavirus, norovirus) or inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease). Use of the oral route has previously been hindered by excessive antibody digestion within the gastrointestinal tract; however, this limitation may be overcome by intelligently applying one or more strategies (i.e. decoy proteins, masking therapeutic antibody cleavage sites, pH modulation, enzyme inhibition or encapsulation). These aspects are additionally discussed in this review and novel insights also provided. With the development of new applications via local injections, topical and peroral routes, it is envisaged that an extended range of ailments will increasingly fall within the clinical scope of therapeutic antibodies further expanding this market.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"To explore the advantages of the local administration of antibodies, current alternative, non-systemic delivery approaches which are in clinical use, being trialed or developed are reviewed and novel insights also provided."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":474,"details":{"paperId":"3219e5262bffcca7cfea48528afb66719fc79812","externalIds":{"MAG":"2158014935","DOI":"10.1002/smll.201302136","CorpusId":"336468","PubMed":"24106164"},"title":"Targeted theranostic nanoparticles: receptor-mediated entry into cells, pH-induced signal generation and cytosolic delivery.","abstract":"Virus-like theranostic nanoparticles: virus-like poly(amino acid) nanoparticles are synthesized that can be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, resulting in encapsulated pH-activatable fluorescence probes that can be turned on in acidic environments but otherwise remain undetectable.

We observed that ATRA promotes calcium entry through store-operated calcium (SOC) channels into acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. This response is associated with changes in the expression profiles of ORAI1 and STIM1, two proteins involved in SOC channels activation, as well as with a significant upregulation of several key proteins associated to calcium signaling. Moreover, ATRA treatment of APL cells led to a significant activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) and its downstream effector AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), linking Ca2+ signaling to autophagy. Pharmacological inhibition of SOC channels and CAMKK2 enhanced ATRA-induced cell differentiation and death. Altogether, our results unravel an ATRA-elicited signaling pathway that involves SOC channels/CAMKK2 activation, induction of autophagy, inhibition of cellular differentiation and suppression of cell death.

In the gastrointestinal tract, the interaction of bacteriophages (phages) and their prokaryotic hosts influences the health of the mammalian host, especially colonization with invasive pathobionts.

ABSTRACT Humans are considered “superorganisms,” harboring a diverse microbial collective that outnumbers human cells 10 to 1. Complex and gravely understudied host- and microbe-microbe interactions—the product of millions of years of host-microbe coevolution—govern the superorganism in almost every aspect of life functions and overall well-being. Abruptly disrupting these interactions via extrinsic factors has undesirable consequences for the host. On the other hand, supplementing commensal or beneficial microbes may mitigate perturbed interactions or enhance the interactive relationships that ultimately benefit all parties. Hence, immense efforts have focused on dissecting the innumerable host- and microbe-microbe relationships to characterize if a “positive” or “negative” interaction is at play and to exploit such behavior for broader implications. For example, microbiome research has worked to identify and isolate naturally antipathogenic microbes that may offer therapeutic potential either in a direct, one-on-one application or by leveraging its unique metabolic properties. However, the discovery and isolation of such desired therapeutic microbes from complex microbiota have proven challenging. Currently, there is no conventional technique to universally and functionally screen for these microbes. With this said, we first describe in this review the historical (probiotics) and current (fecal microbiota or defined consortia) perspectives on therapeutic microbes, present the discoveries of therapeutic microbes through exploiting microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions, and detail our team’s efforts in discovering therapeutic microbes via our novel microbiome screening platform.

PAA disinfection mechanisms for RV were mainly due to genome damage. In contrast, PAA disinfection in TV was due to damage of the proteins important for binding to its host receptor. We also observed that PAA triggered aggregation of TV to a much greater extent than RV. These studies demonstrate that different viruses are inactivated via different PAA mechanisms. This information is important for designing an optimal sanitation practice for postharvest vegetable washing to minimize foodborne viral diseases. ABSTRACT We determined the disinfection efficacy and inactivation mechanisms of peracetic acid (PAA)-based sanitizer using pH values relevant for vegetable sanitation against rotavirus (RV) and Tulane virus (TV; a human norovirus surrogate). TV was significantly more resistant to PAA disinfection than RV: for a 2-log10 reduction of virus titer, RV required 1 mg/liter PAA for 3.5 min of exposure, while TV required 10 mg/liter PAA for 30 min. The higher resistance of TV can be explained, in part, by significantly more aggregation of TV in PAA solutions. The PAA mechanisms of virus inactivation were explored by quantifying (i) viral genome integrity and replication using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and (ii) virus-host receptor interactions using a cell-free binding assay with porcine gastric mucin conjugated with magnetic beads (PGM-MBs). We observed that PAA induced damage to both RV and TV genomes and also decreased virus-receptor interactions, with the latter suggesting that PAA damages viral proteins important for binding its host cell receptors. Importantly, the levels of genome-versus-protein damage induced by PAA were different for each virus. PAA inactivation correlated with higher levels of RV genome damage than of RV-receptor interactions. For PAA-treated TV, the opposite trends were observed. Thus, PAA inactivates each of these viruses via different molecular mechanisms. The findings presented here potentially contribute to the design of a robust sanitation strategy for RV and TV using PAA to prevent foodborne disease.

Significance: Cross-talk between virus-induced oxidative stress and the T cell response probably occurs, diminishing host cell recognition of infected cells. Cysteine-containing peptides represent an important class of T cell epitopes, yet their prevalence remains underestimated. We have established and interrogated a database of around 70,000 naturally processed MHC-bound peptides and demonstrate that cysteine-containing peptides are presented on the surface of cells in an MHC allomorph-dependent manner and comprise on average 5–10% of the immunopeptidome. A significant proportion of these peptides are oxidatively modified, most commonly through covalent linkage with the antioxidant glutathione. Unlike some of the previously reported cysteine-based modifications, this represents a true physiological alteration of cysteine residues. Furthermore, our results suggest that alterations in the cellular redox state induced by viral infection are communicated to the immune system through the presentation of S-glutathionylated viral peptides, resulting in altered T cell recognition.

The family comprises a large number of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, causing an array of diseases of varying severity in animals and humans. To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been identified, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, which are globally circulating in the human population (seasonal HCoV, sHCoV), and the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Seasonal HCoV are estimated to contribute to 15-30% of common cold cases in humans; although diseases are generally self-limiting, sHCoV can sometimes cause severe lower respiratory infections, as well as enteric and neurological diseases. No specific treatment is presently available for sHCoV infections. Herein we show that the anti-infective drug nitazoxanide has a potent antiviral activity against three human endemic coronaviruses, the Alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, and the Beta-coronavirus HCoV-OC43 in cell culture with IC50 ranging between 0.05 and 0.15 μg/ml and high selectivity indexes. We found that nitazoxanide does not affect HCoV adsorption, entry or uncoating, but acts at postentry level and interferes with the spike glycoprotein maturation, hampering its terminal glycosylation at an endoglycosidase H-sensitive stage.

Its assembly and structure-function relationships remain to be well understood. Following the lead of previous studies with other Reoviridae family members, most notably orbiviruses and rotaviruses, we used recombinant baculoviruses to coexpress reovirus core proteins λ1, λ2, and σ2 in insect cells. The resulting core-like particles (CLPs) were purified and characterized. They were found to be similar to cores with regard to their sizes, morphologies, and protein compositions. Like cores, they could also be coated in vitro with the two major outer-capsid proteins, μ1 and σ3, to produce virion-like particles. Coexpression of core shell protein λ1 and core nodule protein σ2 was sufficient to yield CLPs that could withstand purification, whereas expression of λ1 alone was not, indicating a required role for σ2 as a previous study also suggested. In addition, CLPs that lacked λ2 (formed from λ1 and σ2 only) could not be coated with μ1 and σ3, indicating a required role for λ2 in the assembly of these outer-capsid proteins into particles. To extend the use of this system for understanding the core and its assembly, we addressed the hypothesis that the hydrophilic amino-terminal region of λ1, which adopts an extended arm-like conformation around each threefold axis in the reovirus core crystal structure, plays an important role in assembling the core shell. Using a series of λ1 deletion mutants, we showed that the amino-terminal 230 residues of λ1, including its zinc finger, are dispensable for CLP assembly. Residues in the 231-to-259 region of λ1, however, were required. The core crystal structure suggests that residues in the 231-to-259 region are necessary because they affect the interaction of λ1 with the threefold and/or fivefold copies of σ2. An effective system for studies of reovirus core structure, assembly, and functions is hereby established.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An effective system for studies of reovirus core structure, assembly, and functions is established and the hypothesis that the hydrophilic amino-terminal region of λ1, which adopts an extended arm-like conformation around each threefold axis in the reov virus core crystal structure, plays an important role in assembling the core shell is addressed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1346,"details":{"paperId":"a352d456d93bac93b3042956947fabc487ccb498","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s11259-018-9733-1","CorpusId":"255101295"},"title":"The IMPDH inhibitors, ribavirin and mycophenolic acid, inhibit peste des petits ruminants virus infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that ribavirin, a competitive inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, significantly inhibits the replication of PPRV and an uncompetitive IMPDH inhibitor, mycophenolic acid (MPA), exerted more potent antiviral effect again P PRV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":9861,"details":{"paperId":"ec3ede6e7539f8a035cf5955a65fa0c9bbb8b3b5","externalIds":{"MAG":"2563069325","PubMedCentral":"5294970","DOI":"10.3390/v9010001","CorpusId":"17867479","PubMed":"28042824"},"title":"The Immune Response to Astrovirus Infection","abstract":"Astroviruses are one of the leading causes of pediatric gastroenteritis worldwide and are clinically importantly pathogens in the elderly and immunocompromised populations.

The most beneficial dietary carbohydrate components of breast milk are human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and glycoproteins (HMGs), involved in both specific and nonspecific immunity. Fucosylated oligosaccharides represent the largest fraction of human milk oligosaccharides, with the simplest and the most abundant being 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL). Fucosylated oligosaccharides, as well as glycans of glycoproteins, as beneficial dietary sugars, elicit anti-adhesive properties against fucose-dependent pathogens, and on the other hand are crucial for growth and metabolism of beneficial bacteria, and in this aspect participate in shaping a healthy microbiome. Well-documented secretor status related differences in the fucosylation profile of HMOs and HMGs may play a key but underestimated role in assessment of susceptibility to fucose-dependent pathogen infections, with a potential impact on applied clinical procedures. Nevertheless, due to genetic factors, about 20% of mothers do not provide their infants with beneficial dietary carbohydrates such as 2′-FL and other α1,2-fucosylated oligosaccharides and glycans of glycoproteins, despite breastfeeding them. The lack of such structures may have important implications for a wide range of aspects of infant well-being and healthcare.

The oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, is produced from cholesterol by the enzyme, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) has been shown to have anti-viral activities against a wide range of viruses, including a range of positive-sense RNA viruses. In this study, we have investigated the role of 25-HC in norovirus replication using murine norovirus (MNV) as a model system. As a control, we employed herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), a pathogen previously shown to be inhibited by 25-HC. Consistent with previous studies, 25-HC inhibited HSV-1 replication in the MNV-susceptible cell line, RAW264.7. Treating RAW264.7 cells with sub-cytotoxic concentrations of 25-HC reduced the MNV titers.

Instead, simultaneous optimization of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties has been proposed and implemented. As a result, new assays for pharmacokinetic characterization were required and existing assays were modified to fulfill high-throughput requirements. These assays, typically used at early stages of drug discovery and development, were modified and employed during this doctoral thesis to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of carbohydrate mimetics. The project was termed PADMET platform, with PADMET standing for physicochemical properties, absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity. The aims of the platform were on the one hand the elucidation of the pharmacokinetic behavior of carbohydrate mimetics and on the other hand the development of such compounds with improved drug-likeness. \nWhile building up the PADMET platform, the need for an inexpensive and uncomplicated pKa determination method became apparent. A methodology based on 1H-NMR spectroscopy was chosen for this purpose and scope and limitations of this approach were explored. An excellent correlation to reference data was achieved. \n \nThe components of the platform were used to characterize 93 carbohydrate mimetics regarding several pharmacokinetic parameters. The results were used in different projects of which two are discussed in detail in this thesis. First, one of the primary goals of the FimH antagonist project was the synthesis of orally available compounds with fast renal excretion. By the aid of various assays, molecules with a promising profile could be identified. Indeed, in vivo mouse studies confirmed the intended properties. The permeability values gathered during this project were correlated to calculated descriptors and to experimental lipophilicity values in order to identify the driving force of the permeation of carbohydrate mimetics. Calculated lipophilicity values as single descriptor proved to be superior to other descriptors and to combinations thereof. \n \nSecond, during the MAG project compounds with maintained local concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were envisioned.

Sia is a nine-carbon acidic sugar which is present in various organs and body fluids of humans and animals. Sias contribute to many beneficial biological functions including pathogen resistance, immunomodulation, gut microbiota development, gut maturation, anti-inflammation and neurodevelopment. The role of Sias in regulating the metabolism of pigs has seldom been reported. However, we have documented significant beneficial effects of specific Sia-GC’s on health and production performance of sows and piglets. These findings are reviewed in relation to other studies while noting the beneficial effects of the inclusion of Sia, Sia containing oligosaccharide or the sialo-protein lactoferrin in the diets of gilts and sows. The importance of the passive transfer of of Sia and Sia-GC’s through milk to the young and the implications for their growth and development is also reviewed. This information will assist in optimizing the composition of sow/gilt milk replacers designed to increases the survival of IUGR piglets or piglets with dams suffering from agalactia, a common problem in pig production systems worldwide. Abstract Swine are one of the most important agricultural species for human food production. Given the significant disease challenges confronting commercial pig farming systems, introduction of a new feed additive that can enhance animal performance by improving growth and immune status represents a major opportunity. One such candidate is sialic acid (Sia), a diverse family of nine-carbon acidic sugar, present in various organs and body fluid, as well as an essential structural and functional constituent of brain ganglioside of humans and animals. Sias are key monosaccharide and biomarker of sialylated milk oligosaccharide (Sia-MOS’s), sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids in milk and all vertebrate cells. Sias accomplish many critical endogenous functions by virtue of their physiochemical properties and via recognition by intrinsic receptors. Human milk sialylated glycoconjugates (Sia-GC’s) are bioactive compounds known to act as prebiotics that promote gut microbiota development, gut maturation, pathogen resistance, immunomodulation, anti-inflammation and neurodevelopment. However, the importance of Sia in pig health, especially in the growth, development, immunity of developing piglet and in pig production remains unknown.

Such beneficial effects of HMOs on cognition already become apparent during infancy, especially when the behavioural tasks are cognitively more demanding. When animals age, its effects become increasingly more apparent in simpler tasks as well. Furthermore, the combination of HMOs with other oligosaccharides yields different effects on memory performance as opposed to single HMO administration.

widely found in fruits and vegetables and exerts broad‐spectrum pharmacological effects in the liver. Many studies have explored the bioactivity of quercetin in the treatment of liver fibrosis. Hence, through a systematic review and biological mechanism evaluation, this study aimed to construct a body of preclinical evidence for the treatment of liver fibrosis using quercetin. The literature used in this study was mainly obtained from four databases, and the SYRCLE list (10 items) was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature. A meta‐analysis of HA, LN, and other indicators was performed via STATA 15.0 software. Subgroup analyses based on animal species and model protocol were performed to further obtain detailed results. Moreover, the therapeutic mechanism of quercetin was summarized in a directed network form based on a comprehensive search of the literature. After screening, a total of 14 articles (comprising 15 studies) involving 254 animals were included. The results from the analysis showed that the corresponding liver function indexes, such as the levels of HA and LN, were significantly improved in the quercetin group compared with the model group, and liver function, such as the levels of AST and ALT, were also improved in the quercetin group. The species‐ and model‐based subgroup analyses of AST and ALT revealed that quercetin exerts a significant effect. The therapeutic mechanism of quercetin was shown to be related to multiple pathways involving anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant activities and lipid accumulation, including regulation of the TGF‐β, α‐SMA, ROS, and P‐AMPK pathways. The results showed that quercetin exerts an obvious effect on liver fibrosis, and more prominent improvement effects on liver function and liver fibrosis indicators were obtained with a dose of 5–200 mg during a treatment course ranging from 4 to 8 weeks.

Method A total of 18 wistar rats weighing 180-200g were randomly divided into 6 groups, (Group 1 Normal control no castor oil, no treatment administered, Group 2 Experimental control were given castor oil 3.0 ml/kg body weight with no treatment, Group 3 Standard control were given castor oil 3.0 ml/kg body weight + loperamide, Group 4 Treatment 1 were administered 3.0 ml/kg body weight + 25 mg/kg combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide, Group 5 Treatment 2 were administered 3.0 ml/kg body weight + 50 mg/kg combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide, and Group 6 were administered 3.0 ml/kg body weight + 100 mg/kg combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide) with 3 rats per group; the experiment lasted for 24 hours. The action of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, Na+, K+ - ATPase and malondialdehyde were determined. Result Descriptive statistical analysis was adopted using SPSS version 20. Combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide significantly (p<0.05) lowered the elevated levels of malondialdehyde caused by castor oil induced diarrhea; the Na+, K+ - ATPase intestinal activity treatment with both vitamin C and loperamide significantly elevated the activity of Na+, K+ ATPase when compared with the normal control, but both treatments (loperamide alone and vitamin C plus loperamide were not significantly different (p<0.05) to themselves. However, at 50 mg/kg body weight of combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide it showed significant difference in the action of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Conclusion Findings of this study therefore, indicate that a combined effect of loperamide and vitamin C will be an effective therapeutic agent in the management of diarrhea by scavenging of free radicals generated in the cause of diarrheal to reduce lipid peroxidation.

Key words: Rotavirus, Concanavalin A, Cell culture ∗ Author for correspondence INTRODUCTION Rotaviruses (RV) are agents of acute diarrhea in mammals and birds (Kapikian & Chanock, 1996; Burke & Desselberger, 1996). Virion genome is formed by eleven segments of double -stranded RNA nvolved by a concentric triplei -layered protein shell (Kapikian & Chanock, 1996). The outer layer is constituted by VP4 and VP7 proteins being the former associated to hemagglutinin activity (some strains of RV), attachment andidentification of viral and cell receptorsvirulence (Bridger et al., 1998; Kirkwood et al., 1998). The latter, a glycoprotein, seems to be involved in cell penetration either by promoting the stability of VP4 or enhancing its activity (Prasad & Estes, 1997). VP4 is synthesized in free ribosomes while VP7 in ribosomes associated to the endoplasmic reticulum where it isglycosylated. The number of sites and locations of VP7 glycosylation depend upon the strain of RV albeit the glycans are all of high-mannose type (Both et al","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It was concluded that RV replication was not affected consistently by ConA, however it interfered with the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) without altering virus yields."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4506,"details":{"paperId":"84ea4a94884ac03787faffd5191b1adb5d49aabe","externalIds":{"MAG":"2783754831","DOI":"10.1039/c7fo01677h","CorpusId":"3409578","PubMed":"29384543"},"title":"The effect of fucoidan on intestinal flora and intestinal barrier function in rats with breast cancer.","abstract":"Recent research studies have shown that the intestinal flora are related to the occurrence and progress of breast cancer. This study investigates the effect of fucoidan on intestinal flora and intestinal barrier function in rats with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancers. Sixty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the control group, the model group, and the F1 and F2 groups, which were fed fucoidan at concentrations of 200 and 400 mg per kg bw (body weight), respectively. Intestinal histopathological analysis was performed and 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing was used to provide an overview of the intestinal flora composition. The contents of d-lactic acid (d-LA), diamine oxidase (DAO) and endotoxin in plasma were detected by ELISA. Expression levels of the tight junction (TJ) proteins, phosphorylated p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 were measured using western blotting. Our results suggested that the intestinal wall of the model group was damaged. However, after fucoidan intervention, the villi were gradually restored. ELISA showed that the levels of plasma endotoxin, d-LA and DAO decreased in the F1 and F2 groups compared to those in the model group. Fucoidan treatment also increased the expressions of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1 and claudin-8. Furthermore, the expression levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 were upregulated in fucoidan treatment groups. The results of 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing indicated that fucoidan increased the diversity of the intestinal microbiota and induced changes in microbial composition, with the increased Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes phylum ratio.

GT reduced the risk of diarrhea on day 5 by 32% [95% confidence interval 14-50%] OR 0.25 [0.11-0.25] and by 14% [4-24%] by day 7. In the GT group, on day 7 of treatment, all patients had normal stool consistency. GT reduced the time for stool normalization by 1.3 days [0.2-2.3]. A more significant effect was obtained in patients with risk factors for insufficient treatment efficacy and in patients with inflammatory AGE requiring ABT. In those who received GT, a decrease in the concentration of viruses in feces was found, in the control - no statistical differences. The recurrence of AGE symptoms during hospital treatment was recorded with a frequency of 3.6% and 16.7%, respectively (p = 0.111).Conclusions.

Previous evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may contribute to differences in oral vaccine efficacy. Methods: We performed whole metagenome shotgun sequencing on stool samples and measured anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin A in plasma samples from a subset of infants enrolled in a cluster randomized 2x2 factorial trial of improved water, sanitation and hygiene and infant feeding in rural Zimbabwe (SHINE trial: NCT01824940). We examined taxonomic and functional microbiome composition using random forest models, differential abundance testing and regression analyses to explored associations with RVV immunogenicity. Results: Among 158 infants with stool samples and anti-rotavirus IgA titres, 34 were RVV seroconverters. The median age at stool collection was 43 days. The infant microbiome was dominated by Bifidobacterium longum. The gut microbiome differed significantly between early ([≤]42 days) and later samples (>42 days) however, we observed no meaningful differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity, species composition or functional metagenomic composition by RVV seroconversion status. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was the only species associated with anti-rotavirus IgA titre. Random forest models poorly classified seroconversion status by both composition and functional microbiome variables.

However, the specific mechanism remains unclear. It has been increasingly recognized that changes in the gut microbiota may lead to GR through affecting the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Microbiota interacts with multiple factors such as birth to affect the growth of individuals. Microbiota communicates with the nerve system through chemical signaling (direct entry into the circulation system or stimulation of enteroendocrine cells) and nervous signaling (interaction with enteric nerve system and vagus nerve), which modulates appetite and immune response. Besides, they may also influence the function of enteric glial cells or lymphocytes and levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines. Environmental stress may cause leaky gut through perturbing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to further result in GR. Nutritional therapies involving probiotics and pre-/postbiotics are being investigated for helping the patients to overcome GR. In this review, we summarize the role of microbiota in GR with human and animal models.

Since no specific drugs and therapies against rotavirus are available, vaccination is considered the most effective method of decreasing the morbidity and mortality related to rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis. To date, six rotavirus vaccines have been developed and licensed by local governments. Notably, Rotarix™ and RotaTeq™ have been recommended as universal agents against rotavirus infection by the World Health Organization; however, lower efficacies were found in less-developed and developing regions with medium and high child mortality than well-developed ones with low child mortality. For now, two promising novel vaccines, Rotavac™ and RotaSiil™ were pre-qualified by the World Health Organization in 2018. Other rotavirus vaccines in the pipeline including neonatal strain (RV3-BB) and several non-replicating rotavirus vaccines with a parenteral delivery strategy are currently undergoing investigation, with the potential to improve the performance of, and eliminate the safety concerns associated with, previous live oral rotavirus vaccines.

Herein, major human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are assessed for their ability to promote the growth of bifidobacteria and to acidify their environment, key features of prebiotics. During in vitro anaerobic fermentation of infant microbiota, supplementation by HMOS significantly decreased the pH even greater than supplementation by fructooligosaccharide (FOS), a prebiotic positive control. HMOS elevated lactate concentrations, increased the proportion of Bifidobacterium spp. in culture, and through their fermentation into organic acids, decreased the proportion of Escherichia and Clostridium perfringens. Three principal components of HMOS, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose and 3-fucosyllactose, were consumed in these cultures. These three principal oligosaccharides of human milk were then individually tested as supplements for in vitro growth of four individual representative strains of infant gut microbes. Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007 and B. longum ATCC15697 efficiently consumed oligosaccharides and produced abundant lactate and short-chain fatty acids, resulting in significant pH reduction. The specificity of fermentation differed by microbe species and strain and by oligosaccharide structure. Escherichia coli K12 and C. perfringens did not utilize appreciable fucosylated oligosaccharides, and a typical mixture of organic acid fermentation products inhibited their growth. In summary, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose, and 3-fucosyllactose, when cultured with B. longum JCM7007 and B. longum ATCC15697, exhibit key characteristics of a prebiotic in vitro.

Due to its antiviral activity, antibody-based therapy is one of the possible effective countermeasures. Here, a combination of intracellular and extracellular human antibodies was investigated and showed an improved protective effect. Methods The scFv4F5-based intracellular antibody vectors and IgG1 extracellular antibody were constructed and expressed, respectively, and the sensitivity, specificity, and affinity of these antibodies were determined in vitro. In vivo, the protective effect of IgG1 and the combination of antibodies were tested respectively. Furthermore, the dynamics of viral replication, the related cytokines and apoptosis-related proteins were detected. Results In vitro, the expressed intracellular antibody inhibited H5N1 virus propagation and the IgG1 exhibited high specificity, sensitivity, and affinity against the H5N1 virus. In vivo, the extracellular antibody could inhibit viral propagation in a dose-dependent manner. The protective effect of IgG1 was good in a mouse model, and the survival was 100% at a dose of 15 mg/kg under infection with 100 TCID50 virus. When the intracellular antibody was pre-transfected in combination with IgG1, it had a better protective effect. The survival was 16.67% under treatment with IgG1 alone and up to 83.33% under treatment with the combination of antibodies when challenge of 500 TCID 50 virus. Furthermore, the levels of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10 and some apoptosis-related proteins increased.

Although 5-nitroimidazole compounds have formed the mainstay of giardiasis treatment for several years, the increasing number of reports of refractory cases given these and other antigiardial agents has raised concern and led to a search for other compounds. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety, in the treatment of children infected with G. lamblia, of nitazoxanide, given at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days, with those of tinidazole, given as a single dose of 50 mg/kg. Overall, 166 children, each proven to be infected with G. lamblia by the microscopical examination of a faecal sample, were included in the open and randomized trial, each being allocated to receive nitazoxanide or tinidazole. The parents of each treated child were asked to collect two faecal samples from the child between 5 and 10 days after the completion of treatment, for the parasitological follow-up. Only if no G. lamblia were found in both post-treatment samples from a child was that child considered cured. Among the 137 children who completed the study (74 given nitazoxanide and 63 given tinidazole), the frequency of parasitological cure following a single dose of tinidazole was significantly higher than that following six doses of nitazoxanide (90.5% v. 78.4%; P<0.05).

There is currently no proven effective drug treatment or prophylaxis for this coronavirus infection. While developing safe and effective vaccines is one of the key focuses, a number of existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for their potency and efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in the clinic. Here, we review the significant potential of nitazoxanide (NTZ) as an antiviral agent that can be repurposed as a treatment for COVID-19. Originally, NTZ was developed as an antiparasitic agent especially against Cryptosporidium spp.; it was later shown to possess potent activity against a broad range of both RNA and DNA viruses, including influenza A, hepatitis B and C, and coronaviruses. Recent in vitro assessment of NTZ has confirmed its promising activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 2.12 μM. Here we examine its drug properties, antiviral activity against different viruses, clinical trials outcomes, and mechanisms of antiviral action from the literature in order to highlight the therapeutic potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, in preliminary PK/PD analyses using clinical data reported in the literature, comparison of simulated TIZ (active metabolite of NTZ) exposures at two doses with the in vitro potency of NTZ against SARS-CoV-2 gives further support for drug repurposing with potential in combination chemotherapy approaches. The review concludes with details of second generation thiazolides under development that could lead to improved antiviral therapies for future indications.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"NTZ was developed as an antiparasitic agent especially against Cryptosporidium spp."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":427,"details":{"paperId":"bfb239bf362cc17920c61d4b72ce16bffefd9f2c","externalIds":{"MAG":"2125075076","DOI":"10.1002/ptr.5419","CorpusId":"43616502","PubMed":"26206567"},"title":"Therapeutic and Prophylactic Potential of Morama (Tylosema esculentum): A Review","abstract":"Tylosema esculentum (morama) is a highly valued traditional food and source of medicine for the San and other indigenous populations that inhabit the arid to semi‐arid parts of Southern Africa.

Thiazolides inhibit the replication of H1N1 and different other strains of influenza A virus by a novel mechanism: they act at post-translational level by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin at a stage preceding resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion, thus impairing hemagglutinin intracellular trafficking and insertion into the host plasma membrane, a key step for correct assembly and exit of the virus from the host cell. Targeting the maturation of the viral glycoprotein offers the opportunity to disrupt the production of infectious viral particles attacking the pathogen at a level different from the currently available anti-influenza drugs.

In these structures the concerted packaging and replication of the 11 positive-polarity single-stranded RNAs take place to generate the viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomic segments. Rotavirus infection is a leading cause of gastroenteritis-associated severe morbidity and mortality in young children, but no effective antiviral therapy exists. Herein we investigate the antirotaviral activity of the thiazolide anti-infective nitazoxanide and reveal a novel mechanism by which thiazolides act against rotaviruses. Nitazoxanide and its active circulating metabolite, tizoxanide, inhibit simian A/SA11-G3P[2] and human Wa-G1P[8] rotavirus replication in different types of cells with 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) ranging from 0.3 to 2 μg/ml and 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50s) higher than 50 μg/ml. Thiazolides do not affect virus infectivity, binding, or entry into target cells and do not cause a general inhibition of viral protein expression, whereas they reduce the size and alter the architecture of viroplasms, decreasing rotavirus dsRNA formation. As revealed by protein/protein interaction analysis, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, and viroplasm-like structure formation analysis, thiazolides act by hindering the interaction between the nonstructural proteins NSP5 and NSP2.

Since the first synthesis of the drug, a number of derivatives of NTZ have been produced, which are collectively named thiazolides. These are modified versions of NTZ, which include the replacement of the nitro group with bromo-, chloro-, or other functional groups, and the differential positioning of methyl- and methoxy-groups on the salicylate ring. The presence of a nitro group seems to be the prerequisite for activities against anaerobic or microaerophilic parasites and bacteria. Intracellular parasites and viruses, however, are susceptible to non-nitro-thiazolides with equal or higher effectiveness. Moreover, nitro- and bromo-thiazolides are effective against proliferating mammalian cells. Biochemical and genetic approaches have allowed the identification of respective targets and the molecular basis of resistance formation. Collectively, these studies strongly suggest that NTZ and other thiazolides exhibit multiple mechanisms of action. In microaerophilic bacteria and parasites, the reduction of the nitro group into a toxic intermediate turns out to be the key factor.

Here, we report that thiopurines inhibit the replication of the betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, and to a lesser extent, the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. 6-Thioguanine (6-TG) disrupted early stages of infection, limiting synthesis of full-length and subgenomic HCoV RNAs. Furthermore, consistent with our previous report on the effects of thiopurines on influenza A virus (IAV) glycoproteins, we observed that 6-TG inhibited accumulation of Spike glycoproteins from diverse HCoVs. Specifically, 6-TG treatment decreased the accumulation of Spike proteins and increased their electrophoretic mobility to match the properties of Spike following enzymatic removal of N-linked oligosaccharides with Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF). SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs) harvested from 6-TG-treated cells were deficient in Spike. 6-TG treatment had a similar effect on lentiviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike; lentiviruses could be harvested from cell supernatants, but they were deficient in Spike and unable to infect human cells bearing ACE2 receptors. Together, these findings from complementary ectopic expression and infection models strongly indicate that defective Spike trafficking and processing is an outcome of 6-TG treatment. At low micromolar doses, the primary known mode of action of 6-TG is selective inhibition of the small GTPase Rac1. However, we show that selective chemical inhibitors of the small GTPases Rac1, CDC42 and Rho had no effect on Spike processing and accumulation, whereas the broad GTPase agonist ML099 was able to counter the effects of 6-TG, suggesting that an unknown GTPase could be the relevant 6-TG-target protein involved in regulating Spike processing and accumulation.

Background: Several studies have shown that rotavirus and Salmonella infections are the leading causes of infectious gastroenteritis. Although probiotics have been effective in some studies, the use of 3-combination formulation probiotics is rare. Study: This single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled trial included 159 patients (age range, 3 mo to 14 y) hospitalized with infectious gastroenteritis between February 2009 and October 2010. Results: Patients were grouped according to the pathogen identified (48, Salmonella; 42, rotavirus; and 69, unknown origin). The total diarrhea duration was significantly shorter for children who received BIO-THREE (P<0.0001). After BIO-THREE administration, there were significantly less intervention group patients with severe diarrhea at intervention day 3.

While most develop a mild, self-limiting illness, some develop severe acute lower respiratory infection and persistent airway disease. Exposure to ambient particulate matter has been linked to asthma, bronchitis, and viral infection in multiple epidemiological studies. We hypothesized that coexposure to nanoparticles worsens RSV-induced airway epithelial barrier dysfunction. Bronchial epithelial cells were incubated with titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) or a combination of TiO2-NP and RSV. Structure and function of epithelial cell barrier were analyzed. Viral titer and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were evaluated. In vivo, mice were intranasally incubated with TiO2-NP, RSV, or a combination. Lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were harvested for analysis of airway inflammation and apical junctional complex (AJC) disruption. RSV-induced AJC disruption was amplified by TiO2-NP. Nanoparticle exposure increased viral infection in epithelial cells. TiO2-NP induced generation of ROS, and pretreatment with antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, reversed said barrier dysfunction. In vivo, RSV-induced injury and AJC disruption were augmented in the lungs of mice given TiO2-NP. Airway inflammation was exacerbated, as evidenced by increased white blood cell infiltration into the BAL, along with exaggeration of peribronchial inflammation and AJC disruption. These data demonstrate that TiO2-NP exposure exacerbates RSV-induced AJC dysfunction and increases inflammation by mechanisms involving generation of ROS.

However, the understanding of drug regulation of vascular hyperpermeability is so far limited. This study thus aimed to investigate the role of Tongxinluo (TXL) in the maintenance of the vascular endothelial paracellular permeability. Here, changes in permeability were determined by measuring the paracellular flux of FITC-dextran 40000 (FD40), while protein expression and intercellular distribution were examined by western blot and immunofluorescence assay, respectively. We found that TXL alleviated the ox-LDL-induced increase in flux of FD40 and then reduced the hyperpermeability. Moreover, ox-LDL-induced disruptions of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin1 were also restored. This is via the activation of ERK1/2 in the vascular endothelial cells.

Intraperitoneal inoculation of newborn Balb/c mice with rhesus rotavirus induced cholestasis, leading, in most cases, to biliary atresia with lethal outcome, similar to EHBA in human newborns. The influence of interferon-α (IFN-α) on the hepatotropism of rotavirus infection was investigated in this animal model. Single-dose therapy with 10 000 IU of IFN-α protected all rhesus rotavirus-infected pups from cholestatic disease. The same dose, injected 5 d after infection, had no protective effect. Starting with onset of cholestatic symptoms, the treatment with 10 000 IU of IFN-α daily showed good results in 29 mice. Seventy-six percent of the mice recovered after 1 wk of therapy. Histologic investigation revealed normal findings in the hepatobiliary tract of clinically normal mice. Twenty-one percent of the descendants of infected and prophylactic IFN-α-treated mice showed cholestatic symptoms after infection with rhesus rotavirus (79% in an untreated control group) and a milder form of the illness. In conclusion, we found that prophylactic treatment with IFN-α prevented the hepatobiliary system of newborn Balb/c mice from severe damage by rhesus rotavirus in this artificially designed infectious model for EHBA. Infected and icteric mice, treated for 1 wk with IFN-α, had good prospects for recovery and prevention of complete and irreversible occlusion of the extrahepatic bile ducts.

We have developed an injectable vaccine design to prevent infection or GE induced with these enteric viruses. The trivalent combination vaccine consists of NoV capsid (VP1) derived virus-like particles (VLPs) of GI-3 and GII-4 representing the two major NoV genogroups and tubular RV recombinant VP6 (rVP6), the most conserved and abundant RV protein. Each component was produced in insect cells by a recombinant baculovirus expression system and combined in vitro. The vaccine components were administered intramuscularly to BALB/c mice either separately or in the trivalent combination. High levels of NoV and RV type specific serum IgGs with high avidity (>50%) as well as intestinal IgGs were detected in the immunized mice. Cross-reactive IgG antibodies were also elicited against heterologous NoV VLPs not used for immunization (GII-4 NO, GII-12 and GI-1 VLPs) and to different RVs from cell cultures. NoV-specific serum antibodies blocked binding of homologous and heterologous VLPs to the putative receptors, histo-blood group antigens, suggesting broad NoV neutralizing activity of the sera. Mucosal antibodies of mice immunized with the trivalent combination vaccine inhibited RV infection in vitro. In addition, cross-reactive T cell immune responses to NoV and RV-specific antigens were detected. All the responses were sustained for up to six months. No mutual inhibition of the components in the trivalent vaccine combination was observed. In conclusion, the NoV GI and GII VLPs combination induced broader cross-reactive and potentially neutralizing immune responses than either of the VLPs alone.

In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans. ABSTRACT Traditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor binding in a new host. Our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains.

Characterization of different Tyr-to-Phe mutants confirmed that the formation of cross-linked VP dimers is mediated by dityrosine adducts and requires the Tyr704 residue, which crosses over from one neighboring VP subunit to the other. When compared to unmodified capsids, Tyr-cross-linked AAV displayed decreased transduction efficiency in cell culture. Surprisingly, further biochemical and quantitative microscopy studies revealed that restraining the two-fold interface hinders externalization of buried VP N-termini, which contain a phospholipase A2 domain and nuclear localization sequences critical for infection.

We hypothesized rotavirus VE is constant over time but appears to vary as a function of temporal variation in local rotavirus cases and/or misclassified diagnoses. Methods: We analyzed 6 years of data from eight US surveillance sites on 8- to 59-month olds with acute gastroenteritis symptoms. Children’s stool samples were tested via enzyme immunoassay (EIA); rotavirus-positive results were confirmed with molecular testing at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We defined rotavirus gastroenteritis cases by either positive on-site EIA results alone or positive EIA with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmation. For each case definition, we estimated VE against any rotavirus gastroenteritis, moderate-to-severe disease, and hospitalization using two mixed-effect regression models: the first including year plus a year–vaccination interaction, and the second including the annual percent of rotavirus-positive tests plus a percent positive–vaccination interaction. We used multiple overimputation to bias-adjust for misclassification of cases defined by positive EIA alone. Results: Estimates of annual rotavirus VE against all outcomes fluctuated temporally, particularly when we defined cases by on-site EIA alone and used a year–vaccination interaction. Use of confirmatory testing to define cases reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations. Temporal fluctuations in VE estimates further attenuated when we used a percent positive–vaccination interaction. Fluctuations persisted until bias-adjustment for diagnostic misclassification.

Fully closing the gap in rotavirus prevention between LMIC and high-income countries will likely require a multifaceted approach accounting for biological and methodological challenges and evaluation and roll-out of newer and next-generation vaccines.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review will provide an update on ORV performance in LMIC, the increasing body of literature regarding factors that affect ORV response, and the status of newer and next-generation rotavirus vaccines as of early 2020."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1465,"details":{"paperId":"959808f0f45e1186fccbdb4eb094e8c8264225ef","externalIds":{"MAG":"1977378169","DOI":"10.1007/s12602-012-9092-0","CorpusId":"207433887","PubMed":"26781849"},"title":"Upregulation of Intestinal Mucin Expression by the Probiotic Bacterium E. coli Nissle 1917","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"EcN was found to stimulate MUC gene expression in HT-29 intestinal cells and this stimulation was more distinct with polarized cells, which may partially interpret some health benefits of the probiotic bacterium including antagonizing pathogen adhesion and protection of the intestinal mucosa."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":10171,"details":{"paperId":"1441569bd7ecdf2fdc4022808af3f6120efcd867","externalIds":{"MAG":"2191390624","PubMedCentral":"3671692","DOI":"10.5402/2012/628797","CorpusId":"6609122","PubMed":"23762754"},"title":"Use of Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes in Baculovirus Research and Recombinant Protein Expression: Current Trends and Future Perspectives","abstract":"The baculovirus expression system is one of the most successful and widely used eukaryotic protein expression methods.

In this work it is shown for the first time that nanotubes formed by recombinant rotavirus VP6 protein can be used as scaffolds for the synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites. Rotavirus VP6 was produced by the insect cell‐baculovirus expression vector system. Nanotubes of several micrometers in length and various diameters in the nanometer range were functionalized with Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd through strong (sodium borohydride) or mild (sodium citrate) chemical reduction. The nanocomposites obtained were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high‐resolution TEM (HRTEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), dynamic light scattering, and their characteristic plasmon resonance. The outer surface of VP6 nanotubes had intrinsic affinity to metal deposition that allowed in situ synthesis of nanoparticles. Furthermore, the use of preassembled recombinant protein structures resulted in highly ordered integrated materials. It was possible to obtain different extents and characteristics of the metal coverage by manipulating the reaction conditions. TEM revealed either a continuous coverage with an electrodense thin film when using sodium citrate as reductant or a discrete coverage with well‐dispersed metal nanoparticles of diameters between 2 and 9 nm when using sodium borohydride and short reaction times. At long reaction times and using sodium borohydride, the metal nanoparticles coalesced and resulted in a thick metal layer. HRTEM‐EDS confirmed the identity of the metal nanoparticles.

Small SARS-CoV-2 peptide insertions (<34 amino acids) into the hypervariable region of the viral protein 4 (VP4) of RV SA11 strain resulted in reduced viral titer and replication, demonstrating a limited tolerance for peptide insertions at this site. ABSTRACT Species A rotavirus (RVA) vaccines based on live attenuated viruses are used worldwide in humans. The recent establishment of a reverse genetics system for rotoviruses (RVs) has opened the possibility of engineering chimeric viruses expressing heterologous peptides from other viral or microbial species in order to develop polyvalent vaccines. We tested the feasibility of this concept by two approaches. First, we inserted short SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides into the hypervariable region of the simian RV SA11 strain viral protein (VP) 4. Second, we fused the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or the shorter receptor binding motif (RBM) nested within the RBD, to the C terminus of nonstructural protein (NSP) 3 of the bovine RV RF strain, with or without an intervening Thosea asigna virus 2A (T2A) peptide. Mutating the hypervariable region of SA11 VP4 impeded viral replication, and for these mutants, no cross-reactivity with spike antibodies was detected. To rescue NSP3 mutants, we established a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for the bovine RV RF strain. Except for the RBD mutant that demonstrated a rescue defect, all NSP3 mutants delivered endpoint infectivity titers and exhibited replication kinetics comparable to that of the wild-type virus. In ELISAs, cell lysates of an NSP3 mutant expressing the RBD peptide showed cross-reactivity with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody. 3D bovine gut enteroids were susceptible to infection by all NSP3 mutants, but cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody was only detected for the RBM mutant. The tolerance of large SARS-CoV-2 peptide insertions at the C terminus of NSP3 in the presence of T2A element highlights the potential of this approach for the development of vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously. IMPORTANCE We explored the use of rotaviruses (RVs) to express heterologous peptides, using SARS-CoV-2 as an example. Small SARS-CoV-2 peptide insertions (<34 amino acids) into the hypervariable region of the viral protein 4 (VP4) of RV SA11 strain resulted in reduced viral titer and replication, demonstrating a limited tolerance for peptide insertions at this site. To test the RV RF strain for its tolerance for peptide insertions, we constructed a reverse genetics system. NSP3 was C-terminally tagged with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides of up to 193 amino acids in length. With a T2A-separated 193 amino acid tag on NSP3, there was no significant effect on the viral rescue efficiency, endpoint titer, and replication kinetics. Tagged NSP3 elicited cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in ELISA. We highlight the potential for development of RV vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The tolerance of large SARS-CoV-2 peptide insertions at the C terminus of NSP3 in the presence of T2A element highlights the potential of this approach for the development of vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1335,"details":{"paperId":"b8aad85572c63b24f0701291fa8e8cbebb00d182","externalIds":{"MAG":"3158262223","DOI":"10.1007/s11240-021-02112-4","CorpusId":"236426968"},"title":"Using a combination of chitosan, methyl jasmonate, and cyclodextrin as an effective elicitation strategy for prenylated stilbene compound production in Arachis hypogaea L. hairy root culture and their impact on genomic DNA","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This is the first report of simultaneous treatment involving chitosan, methyl jasmonate, and cyclodextrin to induce high stilbene compounds in peanut hairy roots, and the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activity of the CHT + MeJA‬+‬CD crude extract in the protection and damage of DNA is of great interest."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1947,"details":{"paperId":"4b590f94e22e5249ed059cc0b60eb2ac36f1e191","externalIds":{"MAG":"2347168365","DOI":"10.1016/j.addr.2016.04.031","CorpusId":"3575467","PubMed":"27155131"},"title":"Using peptides to increase transport across the intestinal barrier.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review describes the alternatives that use peptides to enhance intestinal absorption and comments on the possible toxic effects derived from their use as permeation enhancers, as well as potential formulation strategies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1292,"details":{"paperId":"73ea94a16e4809b1f3a998d35ef404d9ab40c106","externalIds":{"MAG":"2027043815","PubMedCentral":"2817806","DOI":"10.1007/s10565-009-9139-5","CorpusId":"9890856","PubMed":"19830583"},"title":"Using viral vectors as gene transfer tools (Cell Biology and Toxicology Special Issue: ETCS-UK 1 day meeting on genetic manipulation of cells)","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review summarises some of the viral delivery systems routinely used to mediate gene transfer into cell lines, primary cell cultures and in whole animal models, and introduces the main categories of viral vectors."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1574,"details":{"paperId":"6003dbebfa154a8f36e033954cb141ee33f8c1df","externalIds":{"MAG":"2011871276","DOI":"10.1016/0042-6822(89)90575-8","CorpusId":"23414656","PubMed":"2480689"},"title":"VP4 protein of porcine rotavirus strain OSU expressed by a baculovirus recombinant induces neutralizing antibodies.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The available evidence suggests that the VP4 expressed in insect cells maintained its antigenic configuration and may prove useful in elucidation of the extent of VP4 polymorphism among human and animal rotaviruses and the distribution ofVP4 among these viruses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6447,"details":{"paperId":"a64f69ba7685c8b668f8224fcd786db14e86a51d","externalIds":{"MAG":"2680858216","DOI":"10.1126/scitranslmed.aam5434","CorpusId":"4574606","PubMed":"28637924"},"title":"VP4- and VP7-specific antibodies mediate heterotypic immunity to rotavirus in humans","abstract":"Individual human VP4- and VP7-binding monoclonal antibodies mediate serotype cross-reactive neutralizing immunity to rotaviruses. Investigating heterotypic immunity to rotavirus There are many serotypes of rotavirus, and currently available vaccines include only one or a handful of different strains. However, these vaccines are generally able to induce cross-reactive immunity that prevents diarrheal disease in young children. To get a better understanding of heterotypic immunity, Nair et al. isolated rotavirus-specific B cells from human intestinal tissue and cloned the antibodies for functional analyses. They discovered that heterotypic immunity was often derived from antibodies targeting the VP5* stalk epitope. Although only a small number of antibodies were studied, these results suggest that vaccines focused on the VP5* region may be better able to induce broadly protective immunity to rotavirus. Human rotaviruses (RVs) are the leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid induction of heterotypic protective immunity to RV, which provides the basis for the efficacy of licensed monovalent RV vaccines, have remained unknown for more than 30 years. We used RV-specific single cell–sorted intestinal B cells from human adults, barcode-based deep sequencing of antibody repertoires, monoclonal antibody expression, and serologic and functional characterization to demonstrate that infection-induced heterotypic immunoglobulins (Igs) primarily directed to VP5*, the stalk region of the RV attachment protein, VP4, are able to mediate heterotypic protective immunity. Heterotypic protective Igs against VP7, the capsid glycoprotein, and VP8*, the cell-binding region of VP4, are also generated after infection; however, our data suggest that homotypic anti-VP7 and non-neutralizing VP8* responses occur more commonly in people. These results indicate that humans can circumvent the extensive serotypic diversity of circulating RV strains by generating frequent heterotypic neutralizing antibody responses to VP7, VP8*, and most often, to VP5* after natural infection. These findings further suggest that recombinant VP5* may represent a useful target for the development of an improved, third-generation, broadly effective RV vaccine and warrants more direct examination.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that humans can circumvent the extensive serotypic diversity of circulating RV strains by generating frequent heterotypic neutralizing antibody responses to VP7, VP8*, and most often, to VP5* after natural infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7205,"details":{"paperId":"1a4e891e78784829ebd952973ae12381f3304e75","externalIds":{"MAG":"1524951584","DOI":"10.1128/jvi.65.6.3052-3059.1991","CorpusId":"10026623","PubMed":"1709695"},"title":"VP4-specific intestinal antibody response to rotavirus in a murine model of heterotypic infection","abstract":"We have adapted a murine model of heterotypic rotavirus infection for the purpose of evaluating the intestinal antibody response to an infection that mimics human vaccination.

However, drug delivery systems are often inactivated in acidic environment of stomach or suffer poor absorption from intestinal cells due to the mucus layer. To overcome these issues we developed a drug delivery system constituted by a protein construct made by a Rotavirus capsid protein (VP6) and the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO. This chimeric construct allows specificity towards intestinal cells, the Rotavirus natural target, combined by an enhanced stability given by the eukaryotic protein transporter SUMO. Furthermore SUMO can act as a molecular switch that facilitates import/export of its ligand to the nucleus, the hypersensitive subcellular site target of many cell killing therapies. In this paper we show that SUMO-VP6 constructs self-assembly into stable nanocarriers.

Although initial data did not demonstrate pregnancy as a more susceptible period to severe outcomes of acute severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are an increasing number of reports showing that not only pregnant women might be at significantly higher risk than non-pregnant women by COVID-19 but also the fetus. These findings may be related to adaptive changes that occur during pregnancy, such as the reduction in the residual respiratory capacity, the decrease in viral immune responses, and the increased risk for thromboembolic events. Additionally, despite the SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission evidence being uncommon, maternal illness severity might reflect serious perinatal and neonatal outcomes. Thus, protecting the maternal–fetal dyad against COVID-19 is critical. Even though pregnant women initially were excluded from vaccine trials, several studies have provided safety and efficacy of the overall vaccine COVID-19 platforms. Vaccination during pregnancy becomes a priority and can generate benefits for both the mother and newborn: maternal neutralizing antibodies are transmitted through the placenta and breastfeeding. Moreover, regarding passive immunization, human milk contains other bioactive molecules and cells able to modulate the newborn’s immune response, which can be amplified after the vaccine. Nonetheless, many issues remain to be elucidated, considering the magnitude of the protective immunity transferred, the duration of the induced immunity, and the optimal interval for pregnant immunization.

Despite its immense success, the molecular determinants for virulence attenuation and immunogenicity of the 17D vaccine are poorly understood. 17D evolved several mutations in its genome, most of which lie within the envelope (E) protein. Given the major role played by the YFV E protein during virus entry, it has been hypothesized that the residues that diverge between the Asibi and 17D E proteins may be key determinants of attenuation. In this study, we define the process of YFV entry into target cells and investigate its implication in the activation of the antiviral cytokine response. We found that Asibi infects host cells exclusively via the classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while 17D exploits a clathrin-independent pathway for infectious entry. We demonstrate that the mutations in the 17D E protein acquired during the attenuation process are sufficient to explain the differential entry of Asibi versus 17D. Interestingly, we show that 17D binds to and infects host cells more efficiently than Asibi, which culminates in increased delivery of viral RNA into the cytosol and robust activation of the cytokine-mediated antiviral response. Overall, our study reveals that 17D vaccine and Asibi enter target cells through distinct mechanisms and highlights a link between 17D attenuation, virus entry, and immune activation. IMPORTANCE The yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine 17D is one of the safest and most effective live virus vaccines ever developed. The molecular determinants for virulence attenuation and immunogenicity of 17D are poorly understood. 17D was generated by serially passaging the virulent Asibi strain in vertebrate tissues. Here we examined the entry mechanisms engaged by YFV Asibi and the 17D vaccine. We found the two viruses use different entry pathways. We show that the mutations differentiating the Asibi envelope (E) protein from the 17D E protein, which arose during attenuation, are key determinants for the use of these distinct entry routes. Finally, we demonstrate that 17D binds and enters host cells more efficiently than Asibi. This results in a higher uptake of viral RNA into the cytoplasm and consequently a greater cytokine-mediated antiviral response. Overall, our data provide new insights into the biology of YFV infection and the mechanisms of viral attenuation.

Both vaccines exhibited similar safety characteristics. There is little doubt that Rotateq and Rotarix will be shown to be effective for routine protection of infants. Unfortunately, despite numerous clinical trials, the most common serotype (PlaGa) commonly has been encountered as a natural challenge. Therefore, it is not known whether either vaccine possesses advantages in different epidemiological situations. Continuing the analogy with influenza virus, it may be that optimum protection against different serotypes requires a vaccine that is precisely homologous in antigen composition. If so, Rotateq would provide protection against the most common serotype PlaG1 because in includes both Pla and G1 rotavirus reassortants. Further, it would be expected to provide superior protection against G2, G3, and G4 wild-type virus because it contains reassortants of those specificities. In the case of a natural challenge with a serotype that was not G1, G2, G3, or G4, a Rotateq preparation containing a WC3 reassortant expressing the new G serotype could be formulated readily. The monotypic Rotarix may provide ideal protection against the PlaG1 rotavirus because it is composed solely of the PlaG1 strain. It may also provide cross-protection against other rotavirus serotypes adequate to protect against severe and life-threatening disease. In such a case, its monotypic composition may also provide significant economic savings in manufacturing. The resolution of these questions may have to await extensive post-licensure experience with each vaccine. In the future, possible application of rotavirus vaccine for other situations also should be explored, including use in older children to limit nosocomial infection, use in geriatric populations, use in the immunocompromised host, and possibly use in parents and other adults in contact with infants with rotavirus. Both Rotarix and Rotateq likely are to be launched at prices beyond those affordable in the poorest and neediest less-developed countries. It is essential that there be vigorous pursuit of new technologies to manufacture these products at drastically reduced cost if their true lifesaving potential is to be achieved.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Two vaccine candidates, one monovalent (Rotarix) and one multivalent (Rotateq), appear to meet these requirements and are likely to be licensed in the United States in the next 2 or 3 years."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5096,"details":{"paperId":"5cfaaa42cdf319c2c6ce02331dccd9dcf5321978","externalIds":{"MAG":"2132791342","DOI":"10.1086/522997","CorpusId":"36362256","PubMed":"18198497"},"title":"Vaccines: the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine: discovery to licensure and beyond.","abstract":"Twenty-five years passed between the discovery of the parent strain (WC3) of the pentavalent human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine (PRV) in 1981 and the licensure of PRV in 2006.

Due to growing awareness of the potential ASF threat among pig producers, disinfection processes are considered as one of the most important preventive measures. Currently, a variety of chemical compounds are applied for the disinfection of pig farms. Meanwhile, these chemicals may pose a potential risk, due to their toxic, irritant or corrosive effect. The aim of this study was to determine whether any plant-based natural compounds may show a virucidal effect against ASFV, and simultaneously be depleted of some of the side-effects typical for chemical compounds. Ideally, natural virucidal compounds should be safe for both humans and animals, biodegradable, easily available and inexpensive. Fourteen plant extracts were selected and screened for their virucidal effect against ASFV, using the suspension test inspired by the PN-EN 14675:2015 European Standard procedure. The results of our study showed that most of the tested plant extracts were ineffective against ASFV. Some extracts suspended in a hydroglycolic medium exhibited high virus titre reduction, but it was confirmed that the effect resulted from medium composition.

Because it is known that virus entry is correlated with intracellular calcium concentration rise, this report attempts to present the most important data relevant to the feasibility of combining an insect virus such as baculovirus or densovirus with an insecticide. In this case, the insect virus is not used as a bioinsecticide but acts as a synergistic agent able to trigger calcium rise and to activate calcium-dependent intracellular signalling pathways involved in the increase of the membrane receptors and/or ion channels sensitivity to insecticides. This virus-insecticide mixture represents a promising alternative to optimize the efficacy of insecticides against insect pests while reducing the doses.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This report attempts to present the most important data relevant to the feasibility of combining an insect virus such as baculovirus or densovirus with an insecticide and shows that this virus-insecticide mixture represents a promising alternative to optimize the efficacy of insecticides against insect pests while reducing the doses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3009,"details":{"paperId":"d8deec78eb8496a0047e4b99157310348dc17653","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.10.010","CorpusId":"244095774","PubMed":"34782185"},"title":"Virus neutralisation by intracellular antibodies.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Recent research has shown that antibodies can mediate virus control indirectly by promoting MHC class I presentation and thereby increasing the CD8 T cell response, providing valuable new insight into how non-neutralising antibodies can Mediate potent protection in vivo."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":10104,"details":{"paperId":"757421c6afc901a59e1f30c31105f70a37fe358e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2314023313","DOI":"10.4172/2157-2526.S1-008","CorpusId":"87260553"},"title":"Virus-Like Particle-Based vaccines for Rift Valley Fever Virus","abstract":"There is a clear need for a vaccine to protect humans and livestock against the devastating consequences of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus infections.

In mammals, passive immunity is provided by neutralizing antibodies passed to the offspring via the placenta or the milk as immunoglobulin G and secreted immunoglobulin A. With the long-term goal of producing virus-resistant livestock, we have generated mice carrying transgenes that encode the light and heavy chains of an antibody that is able to neutralize the neurotropic JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM). MHV-JHM causes acute encephalitis and acute and chronic demyelination in susceptible strains of mice and rats. Transgene expression was targeted to the lactating mammary gland by using the ovine β-lactoglobulin promoter. Milk from these transgenic mice contained up to 0.7 mg of recombinant antibody/ml. In vitro analysis of milk derived from different transgenic lines revealed a linear correlation between antibody expression and virus-neutralizing activity, indicating that the recombinant antibody is the major determinant of MHV-JHM neutralization in murine milk. Offspring of transgenic and control mice were challenged with a lethal dose of MHV-JHM. Litters suckling nontransgenic dams succumbed to fatal encephalitis, whereas litters suckling transgenic dams were fully protected against challenge, irrespective of whether they were transgenic. This demonstrates that a single neutralizing antibody expressed in the milk of transgenic mice is sufficient to completely protect suckling offspring against MHV-JHM-induced encephalitis.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that a single neutralizing antibody expressed in the milk of transgenic mice is sufficient to completely protect suckling offspring against MHV-JHM-induced encephalitis."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6546,"details":{"paperId":"94ecf79c6810395d15579016e335417d66feb22f","externalIds":{"MAG":"1906158835","DOI":"10.1128/iai.39.2.917-927.1983","CorpusId":"28470302","PubMed":"6299952"},"title":"Virus-Specific Immunity in Neonatal and Adult Mouse Rotavirus Infection","abstract":"Mouse rotavirus (epizootic diarrhea of infant mice) was used as a model to study the role of virus-specific immunity in infection and diarrheal disease.

Herein, a whey protein lipid concentrate high in MFGM components (WPLC) and whey protein concentrate (WPC; control) were screened for anti-infective activity against porcine OSU and human Wa strains of RV in both the African Green Monkey kidney (MA104) and the human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell lines. Materials and Methods: Confluent cells were exposed to OSU or Wa RV in the presence of WPLC or WPC (control) at 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 5 mg/ml. Infectivity was detected by immunohistochemistry and expressed as % inhibition relative to 0 mg/ml. WPLC efficacy over WPC was expressed as fold-change. One-way ANOVA analyzed data for the independent and interactive effects of concentration, test material, and RV strain. Results: Both WPLC and WPC exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of human Wa and porcine OSU RV infectivity in MA104 and Caco-2 cells (p < 0.0001). WPLC was 1.5–4.8-fold more effective in reducing infectivity than WPC. WPLC efficacy was independent of RV strains, but varied between cell lines. WPLC and WPC at concentrations ≥0.5 mg/mL were most effective in reducing human Wa RV infectivity in MA104 cells (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: WPLC decreased infectivity of two strains for RV which differ in their dependency on sialic acid for binding to cells. Inhibition was observed in the most commonly used cell type for RV infectivity assays (MA104) and an intestinal cell line (Caco-2).

Zinc has a necessary role in the replication of many viruses, however, antiviral action of zinc has also been demonstrated in in vitro infection models most likely through induction of host antiviral responses. Therefore, depending on the host machinery that the virus employs at different stages of infection, zinc may either facilitate, or inhibit virus infection. In this study, we show that zinc plays divergent roles in rotavirus and dengue virus infections in epithelial cells. Dengue virus infection did not perturb the epithelial barrier functions despite the release of virus from the basolateral surface whereas rotavirus infection led to disruption of epithelial junctions. In rotavirus infection, zinc supplementation post-infection did not block barrier disruption suggesting that zinc does not affect rotavirus life-cycle or protects epithelial barriers post-infection suggesting the involvement of cellular pathways in the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in enteric infections. Zinc depletion by N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) inhibited dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection but had no effect on rotavirus. Time-of-addition experiments suggested that zinc chelation affected both early and late stages of dengue virus infectious cycle and zinc chelation abrogated dengue virus RNA replication. We show that transient zinc chelation induces ER stress and antiviral response by activating NF-kappaB leading to induction of interferon signaling.

Although specific vaccines have preventive effects, antiviral therapy is essential for the diarrhea patients. Ziyuglycoside II is a traditional Chinese herb which has been proven to possess anti-virus effects. This study aimed to investigate the roles of Ziyuglycoside II in rotavirus-induced diarrhea and the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that normal MA104 cells treated with RV became swollen and gather together. However, Ziyuglycoside II treatment inhibited cell growth in a dose- and time dependent manner and suppressed RV replication. Moreover, Ziyuglycoside II reversed RV-induced downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and upregulation of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Moreover, Ziyuglycoside II administration and ribavirin blocked toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway both in mRNA and protein level, which was paralleled with immunohistochemical assay. Additionally, Ziyuglycoside II administration improved diarrhea symptoms and decreased diarrhea scores.

Using this technique, a variety of human recombinant antibody fragments can be retrieved from bone marrow cells, lymph node cells, or peripheral blood cells of patients with infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. To develop diagnostically and therapeutically useful human antibody medicines, we should first select recombinant antibody fragments not only with antigen-binding activity but also with bioactivity such as virus or toxin neutralization, or tumor-specific cytotoxicity. To achieve this goal, several steps in antibody phage display may be improved: 1) a larger library should be constructed for possible isolation of minor populations present in the repertoire; 2) the biopanning procedure should be improved for isolation of antibody fragments reactive with immunologically minor epitopes; 3) the screening procedure should be based on the measurement of the bioactivity as well as the antigen-binding activity; 4) if necessary, the affinity and specificity of selected antibody fragments should be improved.

In cell culture experiment, after IPEC-J2 and 3D4/31 cells were treated by 8 mM l-isoleucine for 24 h, the gene expressions of β-defensins and pattern recognition receptors (PRR) signaling pathway were significantly increased. Then, in the in vivo experiment, 28 crossbred weaned pigs were randomly divided into two groups fed with basal diet with or without l-isoleucine for 18 days. On the 15th day, the oral RV gavage was executed in the half of piglets. Average daily feed intake and gain of piglets were impaired by RV infection (P < 0.05). RV infection also induced severe diarrhea and the increasing serum urea nitrogen concentration (P < 0.05), and decreased CD4+ lymphocyte and CD4+/CD8+ ratio of peripheral blood (P < 0.05). However, dietary l-isoleucine supplementation attenuated diarrhea and decreasing growth performance (P < 0.05), decreased the NSP4 concentration in ileal mucosa, and enhanced the productions and/or expressions of immunoglobulins, RV antibody, cytokines, and β-defensins in serum, ileum, and/or mesenteric lymph nodes of weaned piglets (P < 0.05), which could be relative with activation of PRR signaling pathway and the related signaling pathway (P < 0.05) in the weaned pigs orally infused by RV. These results indicate that dietary l-isoleucine could improve the growth performance and immune function, which could be derived from l-isoleucine treatment improving the innate and adaptive immune responses via activation of PRR signaling pathway in RV-infected piglets.

Using mRNA display selection and directed evolution, we designed novel antibody-like protein affinity reagents that target SARS N protein with high affinity and selectivity. Our libraries were based on an 88-residue variant of the 10th fibronectin type III domain from human fibronectin (10Fn3). This selection resulted in eight independent 10Fn3 intrabodies, two that require the N-terminal domain for binding and six that recognize the C terminus, one with Kd = 1.7 nm. 10Fn3 intrabodies are well expressed in mammalian cells and are relocalized by N in SARS-infected cells. Seven of the selected intrabodies tested do not perturb cellular function when expressed singly in vivo and inhibit virus replication from 11- to 5900-fold when expressed in cells prior to infection.

A larger emphasis has been on discovering potential vaccines, novel antiviral drugs, and agents that can mitigate the viral infection symptoms; however, a relatively new area, RNA interference (RNAi), has proven effective as an antiviral agent. The RNAi phenomenon has been largely exploited to cure cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare diseases.

The strong generalized anomeric effect operating in sp(2)-iminosugars determines the α-stereochemical outcome of the glycosylation reactions, independent of the presence or not of participating protecting groups and of the nature of the heteroatom. It also imparts chemical stability to the resulting aminoacetal, aminothioacetal, or gem-diamine functionalities. All the three isomaltose mimics behave as potent and very selective inhibitors of isomaltase and maltase, two α-glucosidases that bind the parent disaccharides either as substrate or inhibitor. In contrast, large differences in the inhibitory properties were observed among the maltose mimics, with the O-linked derivative being a more potent inhibitor than the N-linked analogue; the S-linked pseudodisaccharide did not inhibit either of the two target enzymes. A comparative conformational analysis based on NMR and molecular modelling revealed remarkable differences in the flexibility about the glycosidic linkage as a function of the nature of the linking atom in this series. Thus, the N-pseudodisaccharide is more rigid than the O-linked derivative, which exhibits conformational properties very similar to those of the natural maltose. The analogous pseudothiomaltoside is much more flexible than the N- or O-linked derivatives, and can access a broader area of the conformational space, which probably implies a strong entropic penalty upon binding to the enzymes.
