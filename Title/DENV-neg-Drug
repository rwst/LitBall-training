There is no effective vaccine or drug against DENV infection. Thus, the development of anti-DENV agents is imperative. This study aimed to assess the anti-DENV activity of (E)-guggulsterone using a DENV infectious system. A specific inhibitor targeting signal molecules was used to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of action.

A dose-dependent inhibitory effect of (E)-guggulsterone on DENV protein synthesis and RNA replication without cytotoxicity was observed. The mechanistic studied revealed that (E)-guggulsterone stimulates Nrf2-mediated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, which increases the antiviral interferon responses and downstream antiviral gene expression by blocking DENV NS2B/3B protease activity.

Chimeric dengue viruses (DENV) based on an attenuated flavivirus have been well developed as vaccine candidates by using reverse genetics. In this study, based on the full-length infectious cDNA clone of the well-known Japanese encephalitis virus live vaccine strain SA14-14-2 as a backbone, a novel chimeric dengue virus (named ChinDENV) was rationally designed and constructed by replacement with the premembrane and envelope genes of dengue 2 virus. The recovered chimeric virus showed growth and plaque properties similar to those of the parental DENV in mammalian and mosquito cells. ChinDENV was highly attenuated in mice, and no viremia was induced in rhesus monkeys upon subcutaneous inoculation. ChinDENV retained its genetic stability and attenuation phenotype after serial 15 passages in cultured cells. A single immunization with various doses of ChinDENV elicited strong neutralizing antibodies in a dose-dependent manner. When vaccinated monkeys were challenged with wild-type DENV, all animals except one that received the lower dose were protected against the development of viremia. Furthermore, immunization with ChinDENV conferred efficient cross protection against lethal JEV challenge in mice in association with robust cellular immunity induced by the replicating nonstructural proteins.

Here we show that DENV-2-type-specific mAb 9A3D-8 utilizes the functionally critical residues K307, V308, K310, I312, P332, L387, L389 and N390 for ED3 binding. Surprisingly, this DENV-type-specific epitope is predicted to overlap with the ED3 DENV-complex-reactive antigenic site on the viral surface. Further, this unique binding site enables mAb 9A3D-8 to neutralize virus infectivity at relatively low occupancy of virions compared to other ED3 mAbs identified to date.

Forty percent of the world's population is at risk, with dengue experiencing consistent geographic spread over the years. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common vector-borne viral disease, with nearly 400 million worldwide infections each year concentrated in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Severe dengue complications are often associated with a secondary heterotypic infection of one of the four circulating serotypes. In this scenario, humoral immune responses targeting cross-reactive, poorly neutralizing epitopes can lead to increased infectivity of susceptible cells via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In this way, antibodies produced in response to infection or vaccination are capable of contributing to enhanced disease in subsequent infections. Currently, there are no available therapeutics to combat DENV disease, and there is an urgent need for a safe and efficacious vaccine. Here, we developed a nucleotide-modified mRNA vaccine encoding the membrane and envelope structural proteins from DENV serotype 1 encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (prM/E mRNA-LNP). Vaccination of mice elicited robust antiviral immune responses comparable to viral infection, with high levels of neutralizing antibody titers and antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Immunocompromised AG129 mice vaccinated with the prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine were protected from a lethal DENV challenge. Vaccination with either a wild-type vaccine or a vaccine with mutations in the immunodominant fusion loop epitope elicited equivalent humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies elicited by the vaccine were sufficient to protect against a lethal challenge. Both vaccine constructs demonstrated serotype-specific immunity with minimal serum cross-reactivity and reduced ADE in comparison to a live DENV1 viral infection. IMPORTANCE With 400 million worldwide infections each year, dengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease. Forty percent of the world's population is at risk, with dengue experiencing consistent geographic spread over the years. With no therapeutics available and vaccines performing suboptimally, the need for an effective dengue vaccine is urgent. Here, we develop and characterize a novel mRNA vaccine encoding the dengue serotype 1 envelope and premembrane structural proteins that is delivered via a lipid nanoparticle. Our DENV1 prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine induces neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in immunocompetent mice and protects an immunocompromised mouse from a lethal DENV challenge. Existing antibodies against dengue can enhance subsequent infections via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Importantly our vaccine induced only serotype-specific immune responses and did not induce ADE.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A novel mRNA vaccine encoding the dengue serotype 1 envelope and premembrane structural proteins that is delivered via a lipid nanoparticle is developed and characterized and protects an immunocompromised mouse from a lethal DENV challenge."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4712,"details":{"paperId":"de7239a4e61bbd55dfdca916cd700c535283ca48","externalIds":{"MAG":"2098466244","DOI":"10.1128/AAC.00686-10","CorpusId":"9159627","PubMed":"20837762"},"title":"A Derivate of the Antibiotic Doxorubicin Is a Selective Inhibitor of Dengue and Yellow Fever Virus Replication In Vitro","abstract":"ABSTRACT A doxorubicin derivate, SA-17, that carries a squaric acid amide ester moiety at the carbohydrate (α-l-daunosaminyl) group was identified as a selective inhibitor of in vitro dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 replication (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.34 ± 0.20 μg/ml [0.52 ± 0.31 μM]).

DENV2-specific neutralizing hMAb 2D22 binds to a quaternary structure epitope. We engineered and recovered a recombinant DENV4 that displayed the 2D22 epitope. DENV2 neutralizing antibodies in people exposed to infection or a live vaccine tracked with the 2D22 epitope on the DENV4/2 chimera. The chimera remained sensitive to DENV4 antibodies, indicating that the major neutralizing epitopes on DENV2 and -4 are at different sites.

The complexity of the protective immune response to DENV is still not fully understood. The most advanced vaccine candidates focus specifically on humoral immune responses and the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies. However, results from several recent studies have revealed the protective role of T cells in the immune response to DENV. Hence, in this study, we generated a novel and potent DENV vaccine candidate based on an Orf virus (ORFV, genus Parapoxvirus) vector platform engineered to encode five highly conserved or cross-reactive DENV human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02- or HLA-B*07-restricted epitopes as minigenes (ORFV-DENV).

Moreover, we demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from clinically confirmed DENV-positive donors stimulated with ORFV-DENV generate cytotoxic T cell responses to at least three of the expressed DENV peptides. Finally, we showed that ORFV-DENV could activate CD8+ T cells isolated from donors who had recovered from Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. ZIKV belongs to the same virus family (Flaviviridae) and has epitope sequences that are homologous to those of DENV.

ABSTRACT Here, we identified a novel class of compounds which demonstrated good antiviral activity against dengue and Zika virus infection. These derivatives constitute intermediates in the synthesis of indole (ervatamine-silicine) alkaloids and share a tetracyclic structure, with an indole and a piperidine fused to a seven-membered carbocyclic ring.

In addition, the stereochemistry at C-7 and C-8, as well as the presence of an oxazolidine ring, influenced the potency of the compounds. Mechanism of action studies with two analogues of this family (compounds 22 and trans-14) showed that this class of molecules can suppress viral infection during the later stages of the replication cycle (RNA replication/assembly). Moreover, a cell-dependent antiviral profile of the compounds against several Zika strains was observed, possibly implying the involvement of a cellular factor(s) in the activity of the molecules. Sequencing of compound-resistant Zika mutants revealed a single nonsynonymous amino acid mutation (aspartic acid to histidine) at the beginning of the predicted transmembrane domain 1 of NS4B protein, which plays a vital role in the formation of the viral replication complex.

In 2010, an estimated 390 million DENV infections occurred worldwide, of which 96 million were symptomatic [3]. DENV infections produce a spectrum of clinical disease. This includes mild undifferentiated fever, classical dengue fever, and severe dengue [4]. Severe dengue is characterized by hemorrhage and/or plasma leakage (dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome) and organ failure. Approximately 500 000 severe cases and 20 000 deaths are estimated to occur each year [1]. These syndromes can be caused by each of 4 antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV-1–4) that cocirculate throughout the Western Pacific, Southern and Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas [5, 6]. Owing to global warming, spread of the Aedes vector to many parts of the world, uncontrolled urbanization, and human travel, dengue continues to intensify in DENV-endemic areas and spread to previously unaffected areas. Multiple serotypes frequently cocirculate in areas of endemicity, and epidemics of different serotypes occur unpredictably from year to year. Because of the growing economic burden associated with DENV infections and the lack of effective vector-control measures or specific therapy, a licensed DENV vaccine has become an urgent need [7]. The safety of DENV vaccines has been a vexing problem primarily because of concerns about disease enhancement. Following infection with a single DENV serotype, an individual will develop lifelong homotypic immunity and transient heterotypic immunity, which wanes after several months [8, 9]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that the risk of severe dengue is higher following a subsequent infection with a heterologous serotype. Although the precise mechanisms of disease enhancement are unknown, poorly neutralizing heterotypic antibody is believed to play a role via antibody-dependent enhancement [10]. Antibody-dependent enhancement occurs when poorly neutralizing heterotypic antibodies bind to virus and increase viral uptake by Fc receptor–bearing cells (eg, macrophages), resulting in increased viral replication [11]. Additionally, cross-reactive heterotypic T cells may produce a cytokine storm resulting in increased disease severity [12]. Additionally, the nonstructural protein (NS1)–antibody complexes bind to plasma complement, generating anaphylatoxin [13, 14]. Regardless of the mechanism(s), immune-mediated enhancement has raised significant concerns about the safety of DENV vaccines. However, there has been no evidence of disease enhancement in the field following immunization, although follow-up has been no longer than 25 months [15–17]. A general consensus holds that a tetravalent DENV vaccine protecting against all serotypes simultaneously will be required. The article by Kirkpatrick et al in this issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases highlights a potentially important advance in dengue vaccine development offered by a candidate, live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (LATV) administered as a single subcutaneous injection [18]. Each of the 4 monovalent vaccine components, designed by the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, is composed of a DENV genetic background with a shared core–attenuating 30-nucleotide deletion in the 3′ untranslated region of the viral genome. The DENV-2 component (rDEN2/ 4Δ30) is a chimeric virus with the structural proteins of DENV-2 replacing those of DENV-4.

No dengue vaccine is currently available nor is there an antiviral therapy for DENV infections. We have developed a tetravalent live-attenuated DENV vaccine tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV) that consists of a molecularly characterized attenuated DENV-2 strain (TDV-2) and three chimeric viruses containing the pre-membrane and envelope genes of DENV-1, -3, and -4 expressed in the context of the TDV-2 genome. To impact dengue vaccine delivery in endemic areas and immunize travelers, a simple and rapid immunization strategy (RIS) is preferred. We investigated RIS consisting of two full vaccine doses being administered subcutaneously or intradermally on the initial vaccination visit (day 0) at two different anatomical locations with a needle-free disposable syringe jet injection delivery devices (PharmaJet) in non-human primates. This vaccination strategy resulted in efficient priming and induction of neutralizing antibody responses to all four DENV serotypes comparable to those elicited by the traditional prime and boost (2 months later) vaccination schedule. In addition, the vaccine induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, and targeting the DENV-2 NS1, NS3, and NS5 proteins. Moreover, vaccine-specific T cells were cross-reactive with the non-structural NS3 and NS5 proteins of DENV-4. When animals were challenged with DENV-2 they were protected with no detectable viremia, and exhibited sterilizing immunity (no increase of neutralizing titers post-challenge). RIS could decrease vaccination visits and provide quick immune response to all four DENV serotypes. This strategy could increase vaccination compliance and would be especially advantageous for travelers into endemic areas.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This vaccination strategy resulted in efficient priming and induction of neutralizing antibody responses to all four DENV serotypes comparable to those elicited by the traditional prime and boost vaccination schedule."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7982,"details":{"paperId":"07d4bddf8984cb34fb593a2f057f5a3914866f27","externalIds":{"MAG":"3003313580","PubMedCentral":"7159032","DOI":"10.3390/vaccines8010063","CorpusId":"211048251","PubMed":"32024238"},"title":"A Review on Dengue Vaccine Development","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) has become a global health threat with about half of the world’s population at risk of infection.

In the absence of a universally-accepted vaccine, a drug capable of inhibiting DENV multiplication is an urgent and unmet clinical need. Here we summarize inhibitory strategies by targeting either host biochemical pathways or virus-encoded proteins. A variety of approaches have been generated to design Directly-acting antivirals or DAAs targeting different DENV proteins, with mixed success. Among them, DAAs targeting genome replicating viral enzymes have proven effective against many viruses including, Human Immuno-deficiency Virus and Hepatitis C Virus. DAAs may be derived either from existing compound libraries of novel molecules and plant secondary metabolites or devised through Computeraided Drug design (CADD) methods. Here, we focus on compounds with reported DAA-activity against the DENV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which replicates the viral RNA genome. The structure-activity relation (SAR) and toxicity of the natural compounds, including secondary plant metabolites, have been discussed in detail. We have also tabulated the novel compounds with known anti-RdRp activity. We conclude with a list of DAAs for which a co-crystal structure with RdRp is reported.

Many antiviral compounds have been studied in cultured cells but are unsuitable for clinical applications due to pharmacokinetic profiles, side effects, or inconsistent efficacy across dengue serotypes. Such tool compounds can, however, aid in identifying clinically useful treatments. Here, computational screening (Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures) was used to identify entries in an in silico database of safe-in-human compounds (SWEETLEAD) that display high chemical similarities to known inhibitors of dengue virus. Inhibitors of the dengue proteinase NS2B/3, the dengue capsid, and the host autophagy pathway were used as query compounds. Three FDA-approved compounds that resemble the tool molecules structurally, cause little toxicity, and display strong antiviral activity in cultured cells were selected for further analysis. Pyrimethamine (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 1.2 μM), like the dengue proteinase inhibitor ARDP0006 to which it shows structural similarity, inhibited intramolecular NS2B/3 cleavage. Lack of toxicity early in infection allowed testing in mice, in which pyrimethamine also reduced viral loads. Niclosamide (IC50 = 0.28 μM), like dengue core inhibitor ST-148, affected structural components of the virion and inhibited early processes during infection. Vandetanib (IC50 = 1.6 μM), like cellular autophagy inhibitor spautin-1, blocked viral exit from cells and could be shown to extend survival in vivo. Thus, three FDA-approved compounds with promising utility for repurposing to treat dengue virus infections and their potential mechanisms were identified using computational tools and minimal phenotypic screening. IMPORTANCE No antiviral therapeutics are currently available for dengue virus infections. By computationally overlaying the three-dimensional (3D) chemical structures of compounds known to inhibit dengue virus over those of compounds known to be safe in humans, we identified three FDA-approved compounds that are attractive candidates for repurposing as antivirals. We identified targets for two previously identified antiviral compounds and revealed a previously unknown potential anti-dengue compound, vandetanib. This computational approach to analyze a highly curated library of structures has the benefits of speed and cost efficiency. It also leverages mechanistic work with query compounds used in biomedical research to provide strong hypotheses for the antiviral mechanisms of the safer hit compounds. This workflow to identify compounds with known safety profiles can be expanded to any biological activity for which a small-molecule query compound has been identified, potentially expediting the translation of basic research to clinical interventions.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Computational screening was used to identify entries in an in silico database of safe-in-human compounds that display high chemical similarities to known inhibitors of dengue virus that are attractive candidates for repurposing as antivirals."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5108,"details":{"paperId":"cb199d3b16e03263843daddd3145d3ca9ceedd6b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2168704739","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.02724-07","CorpusId":"41824166","PubMed":"18480438"},"title":"A Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Based on a Complex Adenovirus Vector Provides Significant Protection in Rhesus Monkeys against All Four Serotypes of Dengue Virus","abstract":"ABSTRACT Nearly a third of the human population is at risk of infection with the four serotypes of dengue viruses, and it is estimated that more than 100 million infections occur each year. A licensed vaccine for dengue viruses has become a global health priority. A major challenge to developing a dengue vaccine is the necessity to produce fairly uniform protective immune responses to all four dengue virus serotypes. We have developed two bivalent dengue virus vaccines, using a complex adenovirus vector, by incorporating the genes expressing premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins of dengue virus types 1 and 2 (dengue-1 and -2, respectively) (CAdVax-Den12) or dengue-3 and -4 (CAdVax-Den34). Rhesus macaques were vaccinated by intramuscular inoculation of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulated by combining the two bivalent vaccine constructs. Vaccinated animals produced high-titer antibodies that neutralized all four serotypes of dengue viruses in vitro. The ability of the vaccine to induce rapid, as well as sustained, protective immune responses was examined with two separate live-virus challenges administered at 4 and 24 weeks after the final vaccination. For both of these virus challenge studies, significant protection from viremia was demonstrated for all four dengue virus serotypes in vaccinated animals. Viremia from dengue-1 and dengue-3 challenges was completely blocked, whereas viremia from dengue-2 and dengue-4 was significantly reduced, as well as delayed, compared to that of control-vaccinated animals. These results demonstrate that the tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation provides significant protection in rhesus macaques against challenge with all four dengue virus serotypes.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that the tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation provides significant protection in rhesus macaques against challenge with all four d Dengue virus serotypes."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8115,"details":{"paperId":"59f8d80394330bed044d4449312dc4b70f49a62b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2527621116","DOI":"10.4049/jimmunol.1600927","CorpusId":"30040488","PubMed":"27683751"},"title":"A Tetravalent Formulation Based on Recombinant Nucleocapsid-like Particles from Dengue Viruses Induces a Functional Immune Response in Mice and Monkeys","abstract":"Despite the considerable effort that has been invested in elucidating the mechanisms of protection and immunopathogenesis associated with dengue virus infections, a reliable correlate of protection against the disease remains to be found.

Consequently, the protective role of cell-mediated immunity in the control of dengue infections has begun to be studied. Although earlier research implicated cellular immunity in dengue immunopathogenesis, a wealth of newer data demonstrated that multifunctional CD8+ T cell responses are instrumental for avoiding the more severe manifestations of dengue disease.

Similarly, the reproductive fitness of wMelPop-CLA infected Ae. aegypti females declined with age. These results reveal a general pattern associated with wMelPop-CLA induced pathogenesis in this mosquito species, where host fitness costs increase during aging of both immature and adult life-history stages.

Severe dengue complications are often associated with a secondary heterotypic infection of one of the four circulating serotypes. In this scenario, humoral immune responses targeting cross-reactive, poorly-neutralizing epitopes can lead to increased infectivity of susceptible cells via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In this way, antibodies produced in response to infection or vaccination are capable of contributing to enhanced disease in subsequent infections. Currently, there are no available therapeutics to combat DENV disease, and there is an urgent need for a safe and efficacious vaccine. Here, we developed a nucleotide-modified mRNA vaccine encoding for the membrane and envelope structural proteins from DENV serotype 1 encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (prM/E mRNA-LNP). Vaccination of mice elicited robust antiviral immune responses comparable to viral infection with high levels of neutralizing antibody titers and antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Immunocompromised AG129 mice vaccinated with the prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine were protected from a lethal DENV challenge. Vaccination with either a wild-type vaccine, or a vaccine with mutations in the immunodominant fusion-loop epitope, elicited equivalent humoral and cell mediated immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies elicited by the vaccine were sufficient to protect against a lethal challenge. Both vaccine constructs demonstrated serotype specific immunity with minimal serum cross-reactivity and reduced ADE compared to a live DENV1 viral infection. IMPORTANCE With 400 million worldwide infections each year, dengue is the most common vector-born viral disease. 40% of the world’s population is at risk with dengue experiencing consistent geographic spread over the years. With no therapeutics available and vaccines performing sub optimally, the need for an effective dengue vaccine is urgent. Here we develop and characterize a novel mRNA vaccine encoding for the dengue serotype 1 envelope and premembrane structural proteins that is delivered via a lipid nanoparticle. Our DENV1 prM/E mRNA-LNP vaccine induces neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in immunocompetent mice and protects an immunocompromised mouse from a lethal DENV challenge. Existing antibodies against dengue can enhance subsequent infections via antibody-dependent enhancement.

The significance of the DENV envelope proteins III lies in the fact that it elicits an immune response and hence can be a potential vaccine design candidate. This domain appears to play a key role in the host cell receptor binding for viral entry and in inducing long lasting protective immunity against the infection. We used long molecular dynamic simulation and mutagenesis scanning methods to provide the dynamic environment and propose the potential mutation that may result in enhancing the binding specificity and affinity of the antigen–antibody (Ag–Ab) complex. The binding free energetics were also estimated using free energy perturbation method. One charged mutation that is theorinine 93L to arginine interacting with epitopic glutamic acid 368 strongly contributing in increasing the binding affinity as well as specificity, predicted as −9.6 kcal/mol gain in 2H12-Fab with dengue envelope domain III binding free energy relative to the wild-type.

Morbidity and mortality caused by this virus are alarming for the possible increased threat to human health. A suitable diagnostic test is the prerequisite for designing and developing control measures. But, the tests being employed at present possess one or the other drawback for this disease diagnosis. During the dengue virus infections, NS2B is essential for the stability and catalytic activity of the NS3 protease. N‐terminal 185 amino acids of NS3 protease domain along with hydrophilic portion of NS2B (NS2BNS3pro) is being used to screen dengue inhibitors but not for diagnosis until now. In the present study, we have used purified NS2BNS3pro as an antigen to trap anti‐NS2BNS3pro antibodies of the clinical samples. Antibodies were detected successfully in both Western blot analysis and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. In ELISA, antibodies were detected in both primary and secondary infections of all serotypes. Interestingly, 17 samples declared as other febrile infections by NS1 and IgM/IgG tests were found to be positive in present test, which were further confirmed by reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction. In silico studies suggested the absence of conserved epitopes between NS2BNS3pro and the counterpart in JEV, Zika, and CHIKV, indicating less possibility of crossreaction, which was in turn confirmed by using synthetic peptides representing the above epitopes. Statistical analysis with 76% specificity, 87% sensitivity, and 95% concordance also supported the present test as a suitable test for large scale diagnosis of dengue virus infections.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2324,"details":{"paperId":"94da9ee99a2ee584abf6aa2de24b7f8c3adaafde","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.02.070","CorpusId":"247429319","PubMed":"35287985"},"title":"A novel chimeric dengue vaccine candidate composed of consensus envelope protein domain III fused to C-terminal-modified NS1 protein.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results reveal that antibodies induced by cEDIII-ΔC NS1 not only show anti-viral efficacy by in vitro assays but also provide protective effects against DENV infection in a mouse model."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2020,"details":{"paperId":"6fef1d9ebfe5001fd758b3d13d5ce8c1de3015cb","externalIds":{"MAG":"2005243362","DOI":"10.1016/j.micinf.2008.12.004","CorpusId":"32023127","PubMed":"19114121"},"title":"A novel dengue vaccine candidate that induces cross-neutralizing antibodies and memory immunity.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A proof-of-concept study demonstrated that BALB/c mice immunized with the recombinant cED III developed neutralizing antibodies against all serotypes of dengue virus."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":604,"details":{"paperId":"6f6d370ca16d7c32e0810a8978517afa44734cfc","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s00705-016-2817-8","CorpusId":"254048524"},"title":"A novel dengue virus serotype 1 vaccine candidate based on Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine strain SA14-14-2 as the backbone","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The chimeric virus was able to stimulate high-titer production of antibodies against DENV1 and provided protection against lethal challenge with neuroadapted dengue virus in mice, suggesting that the chimeric vaccine candidate is a promising d Dengue vaccine candidate."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1173,"details":{"paperId":"75ea85cb3fd659c2a7ab55275881922fb2ca3fd4","externalIds":{"MAG":"2790768164","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.01.010","CorpusId":"46840210","PubMed":"29360474"},"title":"A novel flavanone derivative inhibits dengue virus fusion and infectivity","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A novel flavanone derivative, 5‐hydroxy‐7‐methoxy‐6‐methylflavanone (FN5Y), inhibited DENV2 pH‐dependent fusion in cell‐based system with strong binding efficiency to DENV envelope protein at K, K′, X′, and Y′ positions."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1199,"details":{"paperId":"6c4ae5ad1a6449145d81126fd4ff20b74811983e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2982087820","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104636","CorpusId":"204918560","PubMed":"31654671"},"title":"A novel flavivirus entry inhibitor, BP34610, discovered through high-throughput screening with dengue reporter viruses.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An effective small-molecule inhibitor, BP34610, is identified via cell-based high-throughput screening of 12,000 compounds using DENV-2 reporter viruses, which likely targets the DENV E protein."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2387,"details":{"paperId":"bb0bbe02d10613d9a12b47745fbef793a79348c6","externalIds":{"MAG":"2072797460","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2009.08.029","CorpusId":"26042968","PubMed":"19783271"},"title":"A novel fusion protein domain III-capsid from dengue-2, in a highly aggregated form, induces a functional immune response and protection in mice.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The present work provides additional evidence in support for a crucial role of CMI in protection against dengue virus and describes a novel vaccine candidate against the disease based on a recombinant protein that can stimulate both arms of the acquired immune system."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6667,"details":{"paperId":"d598953abbcacf847b84b3a49f97e4dcc51e317a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2755477691","PubMedCentral":"5617232","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1006643","CorpusId":"23223234","PubMed":"28915259"},"title":"A novel mechanism of antibody-mediated enhancement of flavivirus infection","abstract":"Antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection is a well-described phenomenon that is based on the cellular uptake of infectious virus-antibody complexes following their interaction with Fcγ receptors expressed on myeloid cells. Here we describe a novel mechanism of antibody-mediated enhancement of infection by a flavivirus (tick-borne encephalitis virus) in transformed and primary human cells, which is independent of the presence of Fcγ receptors. Using chemical cross-linking and immunoassays, we demonstrate that the monoclonal antibody (mab) A5, recognizing an epitope at the interface of the dimeric envelope protein E, causes dimer dissociation and leads to the exposure of the fusion loop (FL). Under normal conditions of infection, this process is triggered only after virus uptake by the acidic pH in endosomes, resulting in the initiation of membrane fusion through the interaction of the FL with the endosomal membrane. Analysis of virus binding and cellular infection, together with inhibition by the FL-specific mab 4G2, indicated that the FL, exposed after mab A5- induced dimer-dissociation, mediated attachment of the virus to the plasma membrane also at neutral pH, thereby increasing viral infectivity. Since antibody-induced enhancement of binding was not only observed with cells but also with liposomes, it is likely that increased infection was due to FL-lipid interactions and not to interactions with cellular plasma membrane proteins.

Rare neutralizing HMAbs are usually serotype‐specific and bind to quaternary structure‐dependent epitopes. We determined the structure of DENV1 complexed with Fab fragments of a highly potent HMAb 1F4 to 6 Å resolution by cryo‐EM. Although HMAb 1F4 appeared to bind to virus and not E proteins in ELISAs in the previous study, our structure showed that the epitope is located within an envelope (E) protein monomer, and not across neighboring E proteins.

A potent neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody named 7F4 was previously reported and, here, we further analyze the detailed epitope of this antibody. 7F4 recognized a novel conformational epitope close to the N-67 glycan on the E protein. This antibody was specific to the DENV that lacks N-67 glycan, including the Mochizuki strain. Interestingly, the Mochizuki strain acquired N-67 glycan by 7F4 selective pressure. DENVs might have evolved to escape from this antibody considering that most of currently circulating DENVs possess N-67 glycan.

Fighting flavi with flavi Insect-transmitted flaviviruses can cause hemorrhagic fever in humans and contribute to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hobson-Peters et al. isolated a new flavivirus from mosquitoes in Australia that can only infect insect cells. Binjari virus permits swapping of structural proteins from other flaviviruses such as dengue or Zika virus. The chimeric viruses grow to high titers in insect cells but do not infect human cells. They can be used to efficiently produce vaccines or antigens for diagnostics, overcoming safety and manufacturing hurdles of other approaches. A chimeric Binjari virus platform could facilitate and possibly accelerate development of much needed diagnostics and interventions for flaviviruses. Flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis virus present substantial global health burdens. New vaccines are being sought to address safety and manufacturing issues associated with current live attenuated vaccines. Here, we describe a new insect-specific flavivirus, Binjari virus, which was found to be remarkably tolerant for exchange of its structural protein genes (prME) with those of the aforementioned pathogenic vertebrate-infecting flaviviruses (VIFs). Chimeric BinJ/VIF-prME viruses remained replication defective in vertebrate cells but replicated with high efficiency in mosquito cells. Cryo–electron microscopy and monoclonal antibody binding studies illustrated that the chimeric BinJ/VIF-prME virus particles were structurally and immunologically similar to their parental VIFs. Pilot manufacturing in C6/36 cells suggests that high yields can be reached up to 109.5 cell culture infectious dose/ml or ≈7 mg/liter. BinJ/VIF-prME viruses showed utility in diagnostic (microsphere immunoassays and ELISAs using panels of human and equine sera) and vaccine applications (illustrating protection against Zika virus challenge in murine IFNAR−/− mouse models). BinJ/VIF-prME viruses thus represent a versatile, noninfectious (for vertebrate cells), high-yield technology for generating chimeric flavivirus particles with low biocontainment requirements.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A new insect-specific flavivirus, Binjari virus, was found to be remarkably tolerant for exchange of its structural protein genes (prME) with those of the aforementioned pathogenic vertebrate-infecting flaviviruses (VIFs)."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6809,"details":{"paperId":"2810666f6d03a4168577a23a18fe9ed99d3b5565","externalIds":{"MAG":"2186465316","DOI":"10.1586/14760584.2016.1128328","CorpusId":"20608850","PubMed":"26635182"},"title":"A recombinant, chimeric tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate based on a dengue virus serotype 2 backbone","abstract":"ABSTRACT Dengue fever is caused by infection with one of four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (DENV-1–4), necessitating tetravalent dengue vaccines that can induce protection against all four DENV.

In the current commercially available antibody‐capture diagnostic methods, immobilized nonstructural 1 (NS1) antigen indiscriminately binds and detects immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G against any serotype, thus limiting its capability to distinguish existing serotypes of dengue. Identification of dengue serotype is important because certain serotypes are associated with severe forms of dengue as well as dengue hemorrhagic fever. In this study, we aimed to identify an immunogenic epitope unique to DENV2 NS1 antigen and determine the binding specificity of its synthetic peptide mimotope to antibodies raised in animal models. Selection of a putative B‐cell epitope from the reported DENV2 NS1 antigen was done using Kolaskar and Tongaonkar Antigenicity prediction, Emini surface accessibility prediction, and Parker hydrophilicity prediction available at the immune epitope database and analysis resource. Uniqueness of the B‐cell epitope to DENV2 was analyzed by BLASTp. Immunogenicity of the synthetic peptide analog of the predicted immunogenic epitope was tested in rabbits. The binding specificity of the antibodies raised in animals and the synthetic peptide mimotope was tested by indirect ELISA. A synthetic peptide analog comprising the unique epitope of DENV2 located at the 170th–183rd position of DENV2 NS1 was found to be immunogenic in animal models.

Antibodies against DENVs are responsible for both protection as well as pathogenesis. A vaccine that is safe for and efficacious in all people irrespective of their age and domicile is still an unmet need. It is becoming increasingly apparent that vaccine design must eliminate epitopes implicated in the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies. Methodology/principal findings We report a Pichia pastoris-expressed dengue immunogen, DSV4, based on DENV envelope protein domain III (EDIII), which contains well-characterized serotype-specific and cross-reactive epitopes. In natural infection, <10% of the total neutralizing antibody response is EDIII-directed. Yet, this is a functionally relevant domain which interacts with the host cell surface receptor. DSV4 was designed by in-frame fusion of EDIII of all four DENV serotypes and hepatitis B surface (S) antigen and co-expressed with unfused S antigen to form mosaic virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs displayed EDIIIs of all four DENV serotypes based on probing with a battery of serotype-specific anti-EDIII monoclonal antibodies. The DSV4 VLPs were highly immunogenic, inducing potent and durable neutralizing antibodies against all four DENV serotypes encompassing multiple genotypes, in mice and macaques. DSV4-induced murine antibodies suppressed viremia in AG129 mice and conferred protection against lethal DENV-4 virus challenge. Further, neither murine nor macaque anti-DSV4 antibodies promoted mortality or inflammatory cytokine production when passively transferred and tested in an in vivo dengue disease enhancement model of AG129 mice. Conclusions/significance Directing the immune response to a non-immunodominant but functionally relevant serotype-specific dengue epitope of the four DENV serotypes, displayed on a VLP platform, can help minimize the risk of inducing disease-enhancing antibodies while eliciting effective tetravalent seroconversion.

Currently, there are no antiviral drugs and effective vaccination available to combat DENV infections. Major component of DENV which plays the important role for viral binding to the receptor to induce the infection is an envelope (E) glycoprotein.

Therefore, E glycoproteins of all four serotypes was chosen to be analyzed. Conserved regions were found in 100 sequences of each DENV serotype. Multiple sequence alignments was done to obtain consensus sequence. Multiple bioinformatics tools were used for prediction of B-cell and T-cell epitopes based on antigenicity, hydrophilicity, beta-turn, flexibility and surface accessibility.

Here, we report experimental evidence to explain the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results and its implication for drug development. R1479 lost its potency by 125-fold when balapiravir was used to treat primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; one of the major cells targeted for viral replication) that were preinfected with dengue virus. The elevated EC50 was greater than the plasma trough concentration of R1479 observed in dengue patients treated with balapiravir and could possibly explain the efficacy failure. Mechanistically, dengue virus infection triggered PBMCs to generate cytokines, which decreased their efficiency of conversion of R1479 to its triphosphate form (the active antiviral ingredient), resulting in decreased antiviral potency. In contrast to the cytidine-based compound R1479, the potency of an adenosine-based inhibitor of dengue virus (NITD008) was much less affected.

However, oxidative stress was detected in both types of infected cells. Despite this, the survival of mosquito cells benefits from the upregulation of genes related to antioxidant defense, such as glutathione S transferase (GST). A second defense system, i.e., consisting of antiapoptotic effects, was also shown to play a role in protecting mosquito cells against DENV infection. This system is regulated by an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) that is an upstream regulator of caspases-9 and -3. DENV-infected C6/36 cells with double knockdown of GST and the IAP showed a synergistic effect on activation of these two caspases, causing a higher rate of apoptosis (>20%) than those with knockdown of each single gene (∼10%). It seems that the IAP acts as a second line of defense with an additional effect on the survival of mosquito cells with DENV infection. Compared to mammalian cells, residual hydrogen peroxide in DENV-infected C6/36 cells may signal for upregulation of the IAP.

This disease whose symptoms range from mild fever to potentially fatal haemorrhagic fever and hypovolemic shock, threatens nearly half the global population. There is neither a preventive vaccine nor an effective antiviral therapy against dengue disease. The difference between severe and mild disease appears to be dependent on the viral load. Early diagnosis may enable timely therapeutic intervention to blunt disease severity by reducing the viral load. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of RNA interference (RNAi) to attenuate DENV replication may offer one approach to dengue therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings We screened the non-translated regions (NTRs) of the RNA genomes of representative members of the four DENV serotypes for putative siRNA targets mapping to known transcription/translation regulatory elements. We identified a target site in the 5′ NTR that maps to the 5′ upstream AUG region, a highly conserved cis-acting element essential for viral replication. We used a replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (AdV5) vector to deliver a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting this site into cells. We show that this shRNA matures to the cognate siRNA and is able to inhibit effectively antigen secretion, viral RNA replication and infectious virus production by all four DENV serotypes.

This study characterizes the role of LT and its non-toxic B subunit (LTB) in the modulation of antibody responses to a coadministered antigen, the dengue virus (DENV) envelope glycoprotein domain III (EDIII), which binds to surface receptors and mediates virus entry into host cells. In contrast to non-adjuvanted or alum-adjuvanted formulations, antibodies induced in mice immunized with LT or LTB showed enhanced virus-neutralization effects that were not ascribed to a subclass shift or antigen affinity. Nonetheless, immunosignature analyses revealed that purified LT-adjuvanted EDIII-specific antibodies display distinct epitope-binding patterns with regard to antibodies raised in mice immunized with EDIII or the alum-adjuvanted vaccine. Notably, the analyses led to the identification of a specific EDIII epitope located in the EF to FG loop, which is involved in the entry of DENV into eukaryotic cells. The present results demonstrate that LT and LTB modulate the epitope specificity of antibodies generated after immunization with coadministered antigens that, in the case of EDIII, was associated with the induction of neutralizing antibody responses.

However, methods to prevent or treat DENV infection have not been well established. It was previously demonstrated that Lactococcus lactis strain plasma (LC‑plasma) has the ability to stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). As pDCs are key immune cells that control viral infection by producing large amounts of type I interferons (IFN), the present study evaluated the effect of LC‑plasma on DENV infection using a mouse infectious DENV strain. Mice were divided into two groups and the test group was orally administered LC‑plasma for two weeks. Two weeks following administration, the mice were infected with DENV and the relative viral titers and the expression of the inflammatory genes in DENV‑infected tissue were measured using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The relative viral titers were notably lower in the DENV‑infected tissues compared with the control group when LC‑plasma was orally administered prior to DENV infection. Furthermore, the expression of the inflammatory genes associated with DENV infection was also reduced by LC‑plasma administration. To investigate how LC‑plasma administration controls DENV infection, the present study examined anti‑viral gene expression, which is critical for the viral clearance induced by type I IFN. Two weeks subsequent to the administration of LC‑plasma, the expression of anti‑viral gene was measured using RT‑qPCR. Oral intake of LC‑plasma enhanced anti‑viral gene expression in DENV‑infected spleen tissue. To clarify the detailed mechanism, in vitro co‑culture studies using bone‑marrow derived DC (BMDC) were performed. BMDC were stimulated with LC‑plasma in combination with anti‑IFN‑α/β antibody and the expression of anti‑viral genes was measured.

It is estimated that 3.97 billion people living in 128 countries are at risk of dengue, 400 million infections annually, and 96 million asymptomatic cases occurring every year [1-4]. Four closely related dengue serotypes cause the disease: DENV-1 to -4. Serotype specific differences in clinical manifestations have been reported. In a cross-sectional study, Balmaseda et al. [5] reported that among hospitalized children in Nicaragua over 3 years period DENV-2 was associated with more shock and internal hemorrhage while DENV-1 was associated with increased vascular permeability. Furthermore, DENV-1 was associated with more hospitalized primary dengue cases and more primary DENV infection with severe manifestations. Others reported that DENV-2 and DENV-3 may cause more severe diseases than the other serotypes and that DENV-4 is associated with milder illness [6-12]. Certain genotypes within particular serotypes are associated with epidemics of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) vs. classic dengue [11,13]. Aedes aegypt mosquitoes are the primary vectors of DENV throughout the tropics [14]. DENV infection is categorized as asymptomatic infection, subclinical infection, undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, DHF with or without dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and other severe forms of dengue. DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding diathesis, and a tendency to develop a potentially fatal shock syndrome. Clinical manifestations of dengue infection range from mild dengue fever to severe plasma leakage with hemorrhagic manifestations. Thrombocytopenia is an important finding in patients with dengue. A study reported that platelet count of dengue patients can be normal or abnormally high or low. This should be used for future diagnosis [15-17]. Management of dengue patient is to have good fluid replacement therapy until recovery of platelet. Multiple factors have been suggested to contribute to severe dengue such as secondary infections, age, viral load and infecting serotype and genotype [6-8]. Dengue infection is spreading at an alarming rate around the globe and statistics shows that the disease has increased dramatically since 1980, with epidemics occurring in both eastern and western Africa [18,19].

Although Dengvaxia®, was registered in several countries, the results after the immunization of people suggest an increase of risk in non-immune persons and children younger than 9 years old. No other vaccine is registered so far, thus the development of a safe and effective vaccine continues to be a priority for the WHO and the scientific community. Areas covered: This work reviews the structural and antigenic properties of the capsid protein of Dengue virus, along with results of studies performed to assess the immunogenicity and protective capacity in animals of vaccine candidates based on this protein. Expert opinion: The generation of a memory cellular immune response alone, after vaccination against Dengue virus, could be advantageous, as there would not be risk of increasing viral infectivity through sub-neutralizing antibodies. However, it is improbable to achieving sterilizing immunity. In this scenario, an infection could stablished but without the appearance of the severe disease. The cell-mediated immunity should keep the virus at bay. The capsid protein induces a protective immune response in animals without the induction of virus-binding antibodies.

For these reasons, it is necessary to generate more specific antigens to improve serological methods that could be cheaper and used in field operations. Here, we describe a strategy for the inactivation of cross-reacting epitopes on the surface of the Dengue virus envelope protein through the synthetic generation of recombinant peptide sequences, where key amino acid residues from Dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) and 2 (DENV-2) are substituted by alanine residues. The proteins thus generated are recognized by 88% of sera from Dengue NS1+ patients and show improved serotype specificity because they do not react with the antibodies present in seroconverted, PCR-serotyped DEN-4 infected patients.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A strategy for the inactivation of cross-reacting epitopes on the surface of the Dengue virus envelope protein is described through the synthetic generation of recombinant peptide sequences, where key amino acid residues from Dengueirus serotype 1 and 2 are substituted by alanine residues."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2954,"details":{"paperId":"22ffb10c3c83d68b08f318d5ee504d943aa835ef","externalIds":{"MAG":"2313742891","DOI":"10.1021/np200715v","CorpusId":"1850523","PubMed":"22050318"},"title":"Alkylated flavanones from the bark of Cryptocarya chartacea as dengue virus NS5 polymerase inhibitors.","abstract":"An in vitro screening of New Caledonian plants allowed the selection of several species with a significant dengue virus NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibiting activity.

This study demonstrated that antibodies present in immune human sera and 3H5 monoclonal antibody neutralised dengue‐2 virus by altering the virus entry pathway into cells. In the presence of neutralising antibodies, dengue‐2 virus was endocytosed by LLC‐MK2 cells. The endocytosis process involved ruffling of antibody‐coated virions by cellular pseudopodia and invagination of cell membrane. This mode of entry is atypical as compared to direct fusion of dengue‐2 virus with cell membrane in the absence of antibody. The virions were internalised in the form of virion‐antibody complexes consisting of single or clumps of virions. After 3 minutes of incubation, neutralised virions were detected in cellular vesicles, and signs of intra‐endosomal penetration into cytoplasm were not evident even after a prolonged incubation of 10 minutes, suggesting that viral uncoating was compromised. Vesicle‐bound virions were no longer detected after 20 minutes of incubation. In addition, no sign of viral replication was detected in cells infected with “neutralised” virions by immunofluorescence assay.

ABSTRACT Dengue fever, caused by dengue virus (DENV), is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease and is endemic in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world, with an increasing incidence in temperate regions. The closely related flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) can be transmitted vertically in utero and causes congenital Zika syndrome and other birth defects. In adults, ZIKV is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. There are no approved antiviral therapies against either virus. Effective antiviral compounds are urgently needed. Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) are a specific class of nitrogen-containing compounds produced by plants of the Amaryllidaceae family with numerous biological activities. Recently, the AA lycorine was shown to present strong antiflaviviral properties. Previously, we demonstrated that Crinum jagus contained lycorine and several alkaloids of the cherylline, crinine, and galanthamine types with unknown antiviral potential. In this study, we explored their biological activities. We show that C. jagus crude alkaloid extract inhibited DENV infection. Among the purified AAs, cherylline efficiently inhibited both DENV (50% effective concentration [EC50], 8.8 μM) and ZIKV replication (EC50, 20.3 μM) but had no effect on HIV-1 infection. Time-of-drug-addition and -removal experiments identified a postentry step as the one targeted by cherylline. Consistently, using subgenomic replicons and replication-defective genomes, we demonstrate that cherylline specifically hinders the viral RNA synthesis step but not viral translation. In conclusion, AAs are an underestimated source of antiflavivirus compounds, including the effective inhibitor cherylline, which could be optimized for new therapeutic approaches.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"AAs are an underestimated source of antiflavivirus compounds, including the effective inhibitor cherylline that could be optimized for new therapeutic approaches, and are demonstrated to be effective against dengue fever and Zika virus."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":118,"details":{"paperId":"1dcf0bb20b5f5ae9a72c5574c6e80711bf10867f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2044817254","DOI":"10.1002/JMV.2036","CorpusId":"42306158","PubMed":"11536239"},"title":"Amino acid and phenotypic changes in dengue 2 virus associated with escape from neutralisation by IgM antibody","abstract":"Two dengue 2‐specific IgM monoclonal antibodies (MAb) recognised spatially unrelated epitopes on the envelope (E) protein of dengue 2 virus, which were also recognised by serum from 20 and 50%, respectively, of patients with a primary dengue 2 infection.

We here report on an aglycon analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin (code name LCTA-949) that inhibits DENV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in a dose-dependent manner. Virus infection was completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drug-addition experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not encode structural proteins) replication.

Natural host defense peptides which uniquely evolved to protect the hosts have been shown to have antiviral properties. In this study, we firstly collected the venom of the Alopecosa nagpag spider from Shangri-La County, Yunnan Province. A defense peptide named Av-LCTX-An1a (Antiviral-Lycotoxin-An1a) was identified from the spider venom, and its anti-dengue serotype-2 virus (DENV2) activity was verified in vitro. Moreover, a real-time fluorescence-based protease inhibition assay showed that An1a functions as a DENV2 NS2B–NS3 protease inhibitor.

Here, we develop the rationale and strategy for a new approach to developing cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) vaccines for ZKV flavivirus infection. The proposed approach is based on recent studies using a protein structure computer model for HIV epitope selection designed to select epitopes for CTL attack optimized for viruses that exhibit antigenic drift. Because naturally processed and presented human ZKV T cell epitopes have not yet been described, we identified predicted class I peptide sequences on ZKV matching previously identified DNV (Dengue) class I epitopes and by using a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) binding prediction tool. A subset of those met the criteria for optimal CD8+ attack based on physical chemistry parameters determined by analysis of the ZKV protein structure encoded in open source Protein Data File (PDB) format files. We also identified candidate ZKV epitopes predicted to bind promiscuously to multiple HLA class II molecules that could provide help to the CTL responses. This work suggests that a CTL vaccine for ZKV may be possible even if ZKV exhibits significant antigenic drift.

The spread of DENV-associated infections is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide, as there is no widely available vaccine or specific therapeutic for DENV infections. To address this, we developed a novel tetravalent dengue vaccine by utilizing virus-like particles (VLPs). We created recombinant DENV1 to -4 (DENV1-4) VLPs by coexpressing precursor membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins, with an F108A mutation in the fusion loop structure of E to increase the production of VLPs in mammalian cells. Immunization with DENV1-4 VLPs as individual, monovalent vaccines elicited strong neutralization activity against each DENV serotype in mice. For use as a tetravalent vaccine, DENV1-4 VLPs elicited high levels of neutralization activity against all four serotypes simultaneously. The neutralization antibody responses induced by the VLPs were significantly higher than those with DNA or recombinant E protein immunization. Moreover, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) was not observed against any serotype at a 1:10 serum dilution. We also demonstrated that the Zika virus (ZIKV) VLP production level was enhanced by introducing the same F108A mutation into the ZIKV envelope protein. Taken together, these results suggest that our strategy for DENV VLP production is applicable to other flavivirus VLP vaccine development, due to the similarity in viral structures, and they describe the promising development of an effective tetravalent vaccine against the prevalent flavivirus. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus poses one of the most serious public health problems worldwide, and the incidence of diseases caused by the virus has increased dramatically. Despite decades of effort, there is no effective treatment against dengue. A safe and potent vaccine against dengue is still needed. We developed a novel tetravalent dengue vaccine by using virus-like particles (VLPs), which are noninfectious because they lack the viral genome. Previous attempts of other groups to use dengue VLPs resulted in generally poor yields. We found that a critical amino acid mutation in the envelope protein enhances the production of VLPs. Our tetravalent vaccine elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses against all four DENV serotypes.

Cross-reactive and non-neutralizing antibodies against envelope (E) protein of DENV bind to the Fcγ receptors (FcγR) of cells, and thereby exacerbate viral infection by heterologous serotypes via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Identification and modification of enhancing epitopes may mitigate enhancement of DENV infection. In this study, we characterized the cross-reactive DB21-6 and DB39-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against domain I-II of DENV; these antibodies poorly neutralized and potently enhanced DENV infection both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, two enhancing mAbs, DB21-6 and DB39-2, were observed to compete with sera antibodies from patients infected with dengue. The epitopes of these enhancing mAbs were identified using phage display, structural prediction, and mapping of virus-like particle (VLP) mutants. N8, R9, V12, and E13 are the reactive residues of DB21-6, while N8, R9, and E13 are the reactive residues of DB39-2. N8 substitution tends to maintain VLP secretion, and decreases the binding activity of DB21-6 and DB39-2. The immunized sera from N8 substitution (N8R) DNA vaccine exerted greater neutralizing and protective activity than wild-type (WT)-immunized sera, both in vitro and in vivo.

Previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of anti-E Abs in human serum after DENV infection recognize the highly conserved fusion loop (FL) of E protein. The role of anti-FL Abs in protection against subsequent DENV infection versus pathogenesis remains unclear. A human anti-E monoclonal Ab was used as a standard in a virion-capture ELISA to measure the concentration of anti-E Abs, [anti-E Abs], in dengue-immune sera from Nicaraguan patients collected 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-infection.

Analysis of sequential samples from 10 dengue patients revealed [anti-E Abs] and [anti-FL Abs] were higher in secondary than in primary DENV infections.

Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a dot blot assay by using 67 alanine mutants of predicted surface-exposed E residues as a systematic approach to identify epitopes recognized by mAbs and polyclonal sera, and confirmed our findings using a capture-ELISA assay. Of the 12 mouse mAbs tested, three recognized a novel epitope involving residues (Q211, D215, P217) at the central interface of domain II, and three recognized residues at both domain III and the lateral ridge of domain II, suggesting a more frequent presence of interdomain epitopes than previously appreciated. Compared with mAbs generated by traditional protocols, the potent neutralizing mAbs generated by a new protocol recognized multiple residues in A strand or residues in C strand/CC′ loop of DENV2 and DENV1, and multiple residues in BC loop and residues in DE loop, EF loop/F strand or G strand of DENV1. The predominant epitopes of anti-E antibodies in polyclonal sera were found to include both fusion loop and non-fusion residues in the same or adjacent monomer.

Individuals exposed to primary DENV infections develop serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, including strongly neutralizing antibodies targeting quaternary epitopes. To date, no studies have measured the levels and kinetics of serum antibodies directed to such epitopes among populations in regions where dengue is endemic. Here, we use a recombinant DENV4 (rDENV4/3-M14) displaying a major DENV3 type-specific quaternary epitope recognized by human monoclonal antibody 5J7 to measure the proportion, magnitude, and kinetics of DENV3 type-specific neutralizing antibody responses targeting this epitope. Primary DENV3 sera from 30 individuals in a dengue hospital-based study in Nicaragua were studied 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-infection, alongside samples collected annually 1 to 4 years post-primary DENV3 infection from 10 individuals in a cohort study in Nicaragua. We found substantial individual variation in the proportion of DENV3 type-specific neutralizing antibody titers attributed to the 5J7 epitope (range, 0 to 100%), with the mean significantly increasing from 22.6% to 41.4% from 3 to 18 months. We extended the transplanted DENV3 5J7 epitope on the virion (rDENV4/3-M16), resulting in increased recognition in several individuals, helping define the footprint of the epitope. However, 37% and 13% of the subjects still showed little to no recognition of the 5J7 epitope at 3 and 18 months, respectively, indicating that one or more additional DENV3 type-specific epitopes exist. Overall, this study demonstrates how DENV-immune plasma from populations from areas of endemicity, when coupled with structurally guided recombinant viruses, can help characterize the epitope-specific neutralizing antibody response in natural DENV infections, with direct implications for design and evaluation of dengue vaccines. IMPORTANCE The four serotypes of dengue virus cause dengue, a major public health burden worldwide, yet it has been challenging to develop a vaccine that is safe and equally effective against all four serotypes. More in-depth characterization of natural human neutralizing antibody responses is needed to identify determinants of protective antibody responses to all DENV serotypes. Here, we use hospital and cohort studies in a region where dengue is endemic to assess the proportion and kinetics of the DENV3 neutralizing antibody response directed to a quaternary epitope on DENV3 recognized by strongly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody 5J7, which was transplanted into a DENV4 backbone. We show that many individuals recognized the 5J7 epitope, but to various degrees over time, suggesting that additional DENV3-specific epitopes likely exist.

We used BALB/c mice to study the specificity of the CTL response to an immunodominant epitope on the dengue virus NS3 protein. We mapped the minimalH-2Kd-restricted CTL epitope to residues 298 to 306 of the dengue type 2 virus NS3 protein. In short-term T-cell lines and clones, the predominant CD8+ CTL to this epitope in mice immunized with dengue type 2 virus or vaccinia virus expressing the dengue type 4 virus NS3 protein were cross-reactive with dengue type 2 or type 4 virus, while broadly serotype-cross-reactive CTL were a minority population. In dengue type 3 virus-immunized mice, the predominant CTL response to this epitope was broadly serotype cross-reactive. All of the dengue virus-specific CTL clones studied also recognized the homologous NS3 sequences of one or more closely related flaviviruses, such as Kunjin virus. The critical contact residues for the CTL clones with different specificities were mapped with peptides having single amino acid substitutions. These data demonstrate that primary dengue virus infection induces a complex population of flavivirus-cross-reactive NS3-specific CTL clones in mice and suggest that CTL responses are influenced by the viral serotype.

Primary infection only leads to self-limited dengue fever. But secondary infection with another serotype carries a higher risk of increased disease severity, causing life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Serotype cross-reactive antibodies facilitate DENV infection in Fc-receptor-bearing cells by promoting virus entry via Fcγ receptors (FcγR), a process known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Most studies suggested that enhancing antibodies were mainly specific to the structural premembrane protein (prM) of DENV. However, there is still no effective drugs or vaccines to prevent ADE. In this study, we firstly confirmed that both DENV-2 infected human sera (anti-DENV-2) and DENV-2 prM monoclonal antibody (prM mAb) could significantly enhance DENV-1 infection in K562 cells. Then we developed anti-idiotypic antibodies (prM-AIDs) specific to prM mAb by immunizing of Balb/c mice. Results showed that these polyclonal antibodies can dramatically reduce ADE phenomenon of DENV-1 infection in K562 cells. To further confirm the anti-ADE effect of prM-AIDs in vivo, interferon-α and γ receptor-deficient mice (AG6) were used as the mouse model for DENV infection. We found that administration of DENV-2 prM mAb indeed caused a higher DENV-1 titer as well as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and alaninea minotransferase (ALT) in mice infected with DENV-1, similar to clinical ADE symptoms.

Of note, the number of platelets in peripheral blood of prM-AIDs group were significantly increased at day 3 post infection with DENV-1 compared that of prM-mAb group.

The drug will inhibit the ability of the virus to replicate by inhibiting the protease enzyme of the virus. \n \nThe genome of dengue virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that encodes for a polyprotein. The polyprotein is translated into three structural components, namely capsid, envelope, and membrane, and seven nonstructural proteins, namely NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. NS3 is a serine protease that has a critical role alongside host cell proteases in the protein breakdown of viral polyprotein that leads to replication.2 The foundation of Koh-Stenta et al’s study was fundamentally based on the similarity of the amino acid sequence of proteases, especially at the active sites, of the dengue virus and the West Nile virus.3 As extensive knowledge was available on the West Nile virus and peptide-bound X-ray crystal structure confirmed many protein–ligand interactions similar to the two viruses,4 the knowledge could be applied on dengue virus. \n \nThe results of Koh-Stenta et al’s research are highly encouraging and show a possibility for the development of an anti-dengue drug in the near future. Another recent study by Dutch investigators suggested that a protein manufactured by the dengue virus NS4B would make a plausible target for antiviral drug.5 Their data suggested that a metabolite of acetaminophen (a common pain killer) AM404 was able to inhibit dengue virus replication. In our opinion, this is a ground-breaking discovery, and the study not only brings us one step closer to the development of an antiviral drug against dengue virus, but also enables the determination of when the replication of the virus is inhibited. The latter was achieved by using a derivative of dengue virus that expressed luciferase, a molecule that produces bioluminescence, during replication. \n \nHence, by correlating the two studies, we conclude that two proteins, ie, NS4B and NS2B, are potential targets for the development of an anti-dengue drug. Moreover, other areas should be explored, of the viral genome, to target other potential sites for drug development. It could be possible to manufacture drugs that stop the virus from entering the cell (entry inhibitors) or drugs that inhibit the strand of RNA (5′ capping) inhibiting viral replication.6","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Two proteins manufactured by the dengue virus NS4B and NS2B are potential targets for the development of an anti-dengue drug, and the study enables the determination of when the replication of the virus is inhibited."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7242,"details":{"paperId":"c443a4317d9167325b8c04da92e2e6e6300086fd","externalIds":{"MAG":"3115098502","DOI":"10.22271/flora.2020.v8.i6a.706","CorpusId":"234632612"},"title":"Anti-dengue effects of medicinal plants: A review","abstract":"Dengue viral infections have shown to infect 390 million individuals annually, causing severe clinical disease in the form of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

A large outbreak of DENV and ZIKV occurred recently, leading to many cases of illness and death. However, despite decades of effort, we have no clinically specific therapeutic drugs against DENV and ZIKV.

Thus, in this study, we examined a series of novel anti-inflammatory compounds and found that treatment with compound 2d could dose dependently reduce viral protein expression and viral progeny production in HEK-293 and Raw264.7 cells infected with four serotypes of DENV and ZIKV. In addition, considering medication safety, compound 2d could not suppress cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzymatic activities and thus could prevent the side effect of bleeding. Moreover, compound 2d significantly inhibited COX-2 enzymatic activities and prostaglandin E2 levels, associated with viral replication, compared to results with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib. Furthermore, administering 5 mg/kg compound 2d to DENV-2-infected AG129 mice prolonged survival and reduced viremia and serum cytokine levels.

In this study, we examined the antibody responses to E protein as well as to precursor membrane (PrM), capsid, and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of four serotypes of DENV by Western blot analysis of DENV serotype 2-infected patients with different disease severity and immune status during an outbreak in southern Taiwan in 2002.

A blocking experiment and neutralization assay showed that more than 90% of anti-E antibodies after primary infection were cross-reactive and nonneutralizing against heterologous serotypes and that only a minor proportion were type specific, which may account for the type-specific neutralization activity. Moreover, the E-binding activity in sera of 10 patients with primary infection was greatly reduced by amino acid replacements of three fusion loop residues, tryptophan at position 101, leucine at position 107, and phenylalanine at position 108, but not by replacements of those outside the fusion loop of domain II, suggesting that the predominantly cross-reactive anti-E antibodies recognized epitopes involving the highly conserved residues at the fusion loop of domain II.

We provided a dynamic description of DIII at physiological and endosomal pHs and in complex with the neutralizing human antibody DV32.6. We observed conformational exchange in the isolated DIII, in regions important for the packing of E protein dimers on the virus surface.

Although equine WN vaccines are currently being developed, a WN vaccine for humans is years away. There is also no specific therapeutic agent for flaviviral infections. The incidence of human WN virus infection is very low, which makes it difficult to target the human populations in need of vaccination and to assess the vaccine's economic feasibility. It has been shown, however, that prophylactic application of antiflaviviral antibody can protect mice from subsequent virus challenge. This model of antibody prophylaxis using murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) has been used to determine the timing of antibody application and specificity of applied antibody necessary for successful prophylaxis. The major flaviviral antigen is the envelope (E) glycoprotein that binds cellular receptors, mediates cell membrane fusion, and contains an array of epitopes that elicit virus‐neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies. The protective efficacy of an E‐glycoprotein‐specific MAb is directly related to its ability to neutralize virus infectivity. The window for successful application of prophylactic antibody to prevent flaviviral encephalitis closes at about 4 to 6 days postinfection concomitant with viral invasion of the brain. Using murine MAbs to modify human disease results in a human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response that eventually limits the effectiveness of subsequent murine antibody applications. To reduce the HAMA response and make these MAbs more generally useful for humans, murine MAbs can be “humanized” or human MAbs with analogous reactivities can be developed. Antiflaviviral human or humanized MAbs might be practical and cost‐effective reagents for preventing or modifying flaviviral diseases.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The window for successful application of prophylactic antibody to prevent flaviviral encephalitis closes at about 4 to 6 days postinfection concomitant with viral invasion of the brain, so using murine MAbs to modify human disease results in a human antimouse antibody response that eventually limits the effectiveness of subsequent murine antibody applications."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4754,"details":{"paperId":"65ec25cbc8337caea165cd8cf4b0a0db76f4d4dd","externalIds":{"MAG":"2124098076","DOI":"10.1128/CVI.00016-11","CorpusId":"16302774","PubMed":"21270280"},"title":"Antibody Recognition of the Dengue Virus Proteome and Implications for Development of Vaccines","abstract":"ABSTRACT Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection caused by four distinct serotypes of dengue virus, each appearing cyclically in the tropics and subtropics along the equator.

One of the main impediments to the successful advancement of these vaccines is the lack of well-defined immune correlates of protection.

We examined rhesus macaques vaccinated with tetravalent vaccines consisting of live-attenuated virus (LAV) or purified inactivated virus (PIV), followed by boosting with LAV and challenging with wild-type dengue virus. We detected temporal increases in antibodies against envelope proteins in response to either vaccine, while only the PIV/LAV vaccination strategy resulted in anticapsid antibodies. In contrast to results from vaccination, naïve macaques challenged with wild-type viruses of each serotype demonstrated a balanced response to nonstructural and structural components, including responses against the membrane protein.

Methods: Nabs (Neut50 titres) were assessed using Foci Reduction Neutralization Test (FRNT) and in-house ELISAs were used to assess NS1-Abs and NS1-Ab subclasses for all four DENV serotypes in individuals with past DF (n=22), those with past DHF (n=14) and seronegative (SN) individuals (n=7).

ABSTRACT Dengue is caused by infection with any one of four dengue viruses (DENV); the risk of severe disease appears to be enhanced by the cross-reactive or subneutralizing levels of antibody from a prior DENV infection. These antibodies opsonize DENV entry through the activating Fc gamma receptors (FcγR), instead of infection through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis, to result in higher levels of DENV replication. However, whether the enhanced replication is solely due to more efficient FcγR-mediated DENV entry or is also through FcγR-mediated alteration of the host transcriptome response to favor DENV infection remains unclear. Indeed, more efficient viral entry through activation of the FcγR can result in an increased viral antigenic load within target cells and confound direct comparisons of the host transcriptome response under antibody-dependent and antibody-independent conditions. Herein, we show that, despite controlling for the viral antigenic load in primary monocytes, the antibody-dependent and non-antibody-dependent routes of DENV entry induce transcriptome responses that are remarkably different. Notably, antibody-dependent DENV entry upregulated DENV host dependency factors associated with RNA splicing, mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, and vesicle trafficking. Additionally, supporting findings from other studies, antibody-dependent DENV entry impeded the downregulation of ribosomal genes caused by canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis to increase viral translation. Collectively, our findings support the notion that antibody-dependent DENV entry alters host responses that support the viral life cycle and that host responses to DENV need to be defined in the context of its entry pathway.

A hypothetical intrinsic pathway has been proposed for the IL-10 response during antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV infection; however, the mechanisms of IL-10 regulation remain unclear. Principle Finding We found that DENV infection and/or attachment was sufficient to induce increased expression of IL-10 and its downstream regulator suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in human monocytic THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes. IL-10 production was controlled by activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB), primarily through protein kinase A (PKA)- and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/PKB-regulated pathways, with PKA activation acting upstream of PI3K/PKB. DENV infection also caused glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β inactivation in a PKA/PI3K/PKB-regulated manner, and inhibition of GSK-3β significantly increased DENV-induced IL-10 production following CREB activation. Pharmacological inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) activity significantly decreased DENV-induced IL-10 production, whereas silencing Syk-associated C-type lectin domain family 5 member A caused a partial inhibition. ADE of DENV infection greatly increased IL-10 expression by enhancing Syk-regulated PI3K/PKB/GSK-3β/CREB signaling. We also found that viral load, but not serotype, affected the IL-10 response. Finally, modulation of IL-10 expression could affect DENV replication.

The reason for this limited approval is the concern that this vaccine sensitized some of the dengue-naïve recipients to severe dengue fever. Recent knowledge about the nature of the immune response elicited by DENV viruses suggests that all LAVs have inherent capacity to predominantly elicit antibodies (Abs) against the pre-membrane (prM) and fusion loop epitope (FLE) of DENV. These antibodies are generally cross-reactive among DENV serotypes carrying a higher risk of promoting Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). ADE is a phenomenon in which suboptimal neutralizing or non-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies bind to virus and facilitate Fcγ receptor mediated enhanced entry into host cells, followed by its replication, and thus increasing the cellular viral load. On the other hand, antibody responses directed against the host-cell receptor binding domain of DENV envelope domain-III (EDIII), exhibit a higher degree of type-specificity with lower potential of ADE. The challenges associated with whole DENV-based vaccine strategies necessitate re-focusing our attention toward the designed dengue vaccine candidates, capable of inducing predominantly type-specific immune responses. If the designed vaccines elicited predominantly EDIII-directed serotype specific antibodies in the absence of prM and FLE antibodies, this could avoid the ADE phenomenon largely associated with the prM and FLE antibodies. The generation of type-specific antibodies to each of the four DENV serotypes by the designed vaccines could avoid the immune evasion mechanisms of DENVs. For the enhanced vaccine safety, all dengue vaccine candidates should be assessed for the extent of type-specific (minimal ADE) vs. cross-reactive (ADE promoting) neutralizing antibodies.

One explanation for the increased risk of DHF/DSS development after heterologous secondary infections is the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) hypothesis. This hypothesis postulates that pre-existing non-neutralizing antibodies will form immune complexes with the new serotype-infecting virus that in turn will have enhanced capacity to infect macrophages and other Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR)-bearing cells.

Katzelnick et al. examined data from a long-term study of Nicaraguan children exposed to dengue virus (see the Perspective by Feinberg and Ahmed). They confirmed that antibody-dependent enhancement of disease occurs at a specific range of antibody concentrations. Low levels of antibody did not enhance disease, intermediate levels exacerbated disease, and high antibody titers protected against severe disease.

Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe disease has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue disease is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers.

It was found that dengue‐1 immune sera at 1:5 dilution (n = 12) could neutralize dengue‐2 infections in BHK‐21 cells, as assessed by a standard plaque‐reduction neutralization assay. Two‐thirds of the dengue‐1 immune sera at 1:25 dilution demonstrated neutralizing effects for dengue‐2 infections, whereas, non‐immune sera revealed no neutralization for dengue‐2 infections in BHK‐21 cells. Human mononuclear leukocytes in response to dengue‐2 infections elicited a T cell helper 1 (Th1) response revealing induction of IFNγ but not IL‐4 production. Dengue‐1 immune sera did not neutralize dengue‐2 infections in mononuclear leukocytes. Subneutralizing titers of dengue‐1 immune sera at 1:250, but not at 1:10 dilution, enhanced dengue‐2 infections in mononuclear leukocytes (1.2 ± 0.7 × 104 vs. 2.8 ± 0.3 × 102 PFU/ml). The enhancement of dengue‐2 infections in mononuclear leukocytes by dengue‐1 immune sera at 1:250 was associated with an increase in the lymphocyte proliferation index, and a decrease in IFNγ production (56 ± 24 vs. 12 ± 3 pg/ml).

Accordingly, research on the processes governing the DENV infection cycle is essential to develop vaccines or antiviral therapies. One of the most attractive DENV molecules to investigate is nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), which is essential for viral replication and a major immune target for infection. Objective: To produce antibodies to support future studies on NS3 and its cellular interactions with other proteins. Materials and methods: Two recombinant proteins of the helicase domain of DENV NS3 serotype 2 were expressed, and used to immunize mice and produce polyclonal antibodies.

A few flaviviruses, primarily DV and YFV, cause hemorrhagic manifestations in severe infection. The chapter investigates targets for the treatment of flaviviruses, including viral and host elements that may be effectively targeted for treatment. Important progress in the treatment of flavivirus infections has been made recently, bringing ever closer to fruition the important goal of developing a broad-spectrum agent that is effective after disease manifestation. New animal models of flaviviral disease would be important in developing a better understanding of basic virology and antiviral treatment. Epidemiological methods to detect and predict the severity and location of outbreaks would be beneficial in control of DV diseases, giving better chances to efficacy of antiflaviviral agents.

In this report, the potential target of the inhibitory effect of NO was studied at the molecular level. The NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), showed an inhibitory effect on RNA accumulation at around 8-14 h post-infection, which corresponded to the step of viral RNA synthesis in the DENV life cycle. The activity of the viral replicase isolated from SNAP-treated DENV-2-infected cells was suppressed significantly compared with that of the negative-control N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (NAP)-treated cells. Further investigations on the molecular target of NO action showed that the activity of recombinant DENV-2 NS5 in negative-strand RNA synthesis was affected in the presence of 5 mM SNAP in in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assays, whereas the RNA helicase activity of DENV-2 NS3 was not inhibited up to a concentration of 15 mM SNAP.

Currently, there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral drug for dengue virus (DENV) infection. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa) and its related derivatives have been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses. However, it is unknown whether Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, affects DENV infection. Here, we found that the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in DENV‐permissive cells, while the viral RNA and viral protein synthesis were not affected. Moreover, results from time‐of‐addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV was exhibited by targeting the virus itself, not the host cells. Directly incubating DENV with CBX resulted in a remarkable reduction of virus titer and virus infectivity. Furthermore, DENV RNA from progeny virions in the supernatants was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in a dose‐dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that the antiviral activity of CBX against DENV may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself. Our work, for the first time, demonstrates that CBX has antiviral activity against DENV infection, providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against dengue.

The increasing number of dengue infections per year suggests that the virus is becoming more virulent and its transmission is expanding. Nevertheless, no effective treatment for dengue infection currently exists. In a search for antiviral agents effective against dengue virus, we investigated the potential of targeting a structural protein site rather than an enzymatic one. Using this approach, we now report the discovery of a small molecule ligand that inhibits viral growth. Our results also provide the first evidence that the binding site, a pocket located at the hinge between domains 1 and 2 of the envelope protein (E protein) on the virus surface, is a valid target for antiviral therapy. Ligand candidates were identified from libraries of approximately 142,000 compounds using a computational high-throughput screening protocol targeting this pocket of the E protein. Cell-based assays were conducted on 23 top-ranked compounds. Among four with good antiviral activity profiles, the compound P02 was found to inhibit viral reproduction at micromolar concentrations. Using saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy, we also show that the compound binds virus and competes for binding E protein with the known ligand N-octyl-beta-D-glucoside.

Dengue vector control is a key component for the dengue control strategy, since no absolutely effective vaccine or drug is available yet. However, the rapid rise and spread of mosquito insecticide resistance have become major threats to the efficiency of insecticide-based vector control activities. Thus, innovative vector control tools are badly needed. This study aims to confirm the antivirus effectiveness of ivermectin on dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) in Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894), then to explore its potential use in the combating to the dengue epidemics. Methods Aedes albopictus were first infected with DENV-2 in human whole blood, and at the fourth day after infectious blood feeding, they were divided into eight groups. Seven of them were held for six days with access to 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng/ml ivermectin, respectively, and the last one was set as a historical control group, which was stored at -80°C until being detected at the same time with the other groups. Each mosquito was detected using real-time fluorescent RT-PCR kit. DENV-2 RNA concentration (copies/ml) and infection rate in each group were compared. Results Both of quantitatively and qualitatively inhibiting effects of ivermectin have been detected in this study. Generally, DENV-2 replicated well in Aedes albopictus without ivermectin intervention, whose virus loads exhibited significantly higher when the mosquitoes were holding from 4 days to 10 days after infectious blood feeding.

Furthermore, activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) was required for ceramide-induced NF-κB activation and iNOS expression. Notably, anti-DENV NS1 Abs caused GSK-3β–mediated NF-κB activation and iNOS expression, which were regulated by aSMase. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β reduced hepatic endothelial cell apoptosis in mice passively administered anti-DENV NS1 Abs. These results suggest that anti-DENV NS1 Abs bind to the endothelial cell membrane and cause NO production and apoptosis via a mechanism involving the aSMase/ceramide/GSK-3β/NF-κB/iNOS/NO signaling pathway.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that anti-DENV NS1 Abs bind to the endothelial cell membrane and cause NO production and apoptosis via a mechanism involving the aSMase/ceramide/GSK-3β/NF-κB/iNOS/NO signaling pathway."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7784,"details":{"paperId":"78cf3fe386cdbc0ec69000e110287c9b199c4919","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9573221","DOI":"10.3390/plants11192631","CorpusId":"252828114","PubMed":"36235496"},"title":"Antrodia cinnamomea Suppress Dengue Virus Infection through Enhancing the Secretion of Interferon-Alpha","abstract":"Dengue caused by dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne disease. Dengue exhibits a wide range of symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to flu-like illness, and a few symptomatic cases may develop into severe dengue, leading to death. However, there are no effective and safe therapeutics for DENV infections. We have previously reported that cytokine expression, especially inflammatory cytokines, was altered in patients with different severities of dengue. Antrodia cinnamomea (A. cinnamomea) is a precious and endemic medical mushroom in Taiwan. It contains unique chemical components and exhibits biological activities, including suppressing effects on inflammation and viral infection-related diseases. According to previous studies, megakaryocytes can support DENV infection, and the number of megakaryocytes is positively correlated with the viral load in the serum of acute dengue patients. In the study, we investigated the anti-DENV effects of two ethanolic extracts (ACEs 1–2) and three isolated compounds (ACEs 3–5) from A. cinnamomea on DENV infection in Meg-01 cells. Our results not only demonstrated that ACE-3 and ACE-4 significantly suppressed DENV infection, but also reduced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels. Moreover, the level of the antiviral cytokine interferon (IFN)-α was also increased by ACE-3 and ACE-4 in Meg-01 cells after DENV infection. Here, we provide new insights into the potential use of A. cinnamomea extracts as therapeutic agents against DENV infection.

The CYD-TDV dengue vaccine produced by Sanofi-Pasteur is the only dengue vaccine evaluated in phase 3 controlled clinical trials. Notwithstanding the significant contribution to the development of a vaccine against dengue, the three phase 3 clinical studies of CYD-TDV and the meta-analysis of the long-term follow up of those studies, have provided evidence that this vaccine exhibited partial vaccine efficacy to protect against virologically confirmed dengue and lead to four considerations: a) adequate vaccine efficacy against dengue virus (DENV) infections 3 and 4, less vaccine efficacy against DENV 1 and no protection against infection by DENV 2; b) decreased vaccine efficacy in dengue seronegative individuals at the beginning of the vaccination; c) 83% and 90% protection against hospitalizations and severe forms of dengue, respectively, at 25 months follow-up; and d) increased hospitalization for dengue in the vaccinated group, in children under nine years of age at the time of vaccination, detected since the third year of follow-up. The benefit of the CYD-TDV vaccine can be summarized in the protection against infection by DENV 3 and 4, as well as protection for hospitalizations and severe cases in people over nine years, who have had previous dengue infection, working mainly as a booster. In this review we identified elements on efficacy and safety of this vaccine that must be taken into account in the licensing process and potential inclusion in the national vaccination program of Mexico. The available scientific evidence on the CYD-TDV vaccine shows merits, but also leads to relevant questions that should be answered to properly assess the safety profile of the product and the target populations of potential benefit. In this regard we consider it would be informative to complete the 6-year follow-up after starting vaccination, according to the company’s own study protocol recommended by the World Health Organization. As with any new vaccine, the potential licensing and implementation of the CYD-TDV as part of Mexico’s vaccination program, requires a clear definition of the balance between the expected benefits and risks. Particularly with a vaccine with variable efficacy and some signs of risk, in the probable case of licensing, the post-licensed period must involve the development of detailed protocols to immediately identify risks or any health event associated with vaccination.","publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1933,"details":{"paperId":"61bfd4d60f2871ddf9d9b784886153a03e8e084e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2087107782","DOI":"10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.04.011","CorpusId":"1070238","PubMed":"19406165"},"title":"Application of antibodies against nonstructural protein 2B of dengue serotype 2 virus induced by DNA immunisation or recombinant protein NS 2B immunisation in BALB/c mice.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results indicate that the polyclonal Abs could be used as a tool for studying the role of NS2B in the pathogenesis of DV2 and can recognise both the natural and denatured NS2b protein."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3509,"details":{"paperId":"1a4f12ff896a4ddbdc5bc9e209bbf206339396fc","externalIds":{"MAG":"3026277863","DOI":"10.1080/00397911.2020.1764584","CorpusId":"219460332"},"title":"Approaches for the development of potential dengue inhibitors","abstract":"Abstract Dengue is the most severe mosquito borne viral disease for several decades in tropical and subtropical countries.

Climate change, virus evolution, and social factors may increase the risk of these flavivirus infections and may lead to the emergence of other flaviviruses in Europe that are endemic in (sub)tropical regions of the world. Control of the spread of flaviviruses is very difficult considering the cycling of flaviviruses between arthropod vectors and animal reservoir hosts. The increasing threat of flavivirus infections emphasizes the necessity of a sustainable vector surveillance system, an active animal health surveillance system and an adequate human surveillance system for early detection of flavivirus infections. Vaccination is the most important approach to prevent flavivirus infections. Effective inactivated whole virus vaccines against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) infection are available. Implementation of TBE vaccination based on favorable cost-effectiveness estimates per region and per target group can reduce the disease burden of TBE infection. At present, several West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine candidates are in various stages of clinical development.

Therefore, there is a significant need for DENV vaccine platforms capable of generating broad immune responses including durable cellular immunity, as well as novel analytical tools to assess the magnitude, diversity, and persistence of vaccine-elicited immunity. In this study, we demonstrate that a single dose of the recombinant, tetravalent, live-attenuated DENV vaccine TAK-003 elicits potent and durable cellular immunity against both the structural and non-structural proteins of all four DENV serotypes, which is maintained for at least 4 months post-immunization. Although not contained within the vaccine formulation, significant reactivity against the non-structural (NS) proteins of DENV-1,-3, and-4 is observed following vaccination, to an extent directly proportional to the magnitude of responses to the corresponding vaccine (DENV-2) components. Distinct, quantifiable, and durable patterns of DENV antigen reactivity can be observed in individuals following vaccination. Detailed epitope mapping of T cell reactivity against the DENV-2 proteome using a matrix of overlapping peptide pools demonstrated that TAK-003 elicits a broad response directed across the DENV-2 proteome, with focused reactivity against NS1 and NS3.

Specific antibody detection has been the mainstay of diagnosis which is prone for both false positive and false negative reactions. The newer parameter NS1 appears to be highly specific and reliable for diagnosis of dengue infection from the first day of fever. Platelet count is the only accessory test for diagnosis of dengue infection in the peripheral laboratories. Therefore, we tried to evaluate the association of platelet counts against NS1 and IgM/IgG in dengue infections.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSerum samples from clinically suspected dengue cases were tested for NS1, IgM and IgG by immunochromatography-based test. Platelet counts were obtained for all positive cases and 150 dengue seronegative cases of fever that served as controls. Test results of dengue-specific parameters were compared against platelet counts. The proportions obtained were compared by Standard error of the difference between the proportions (SEP test).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 2104 samples tested, 320 were positive for one or more dengue parameters. Of the 320, 95 were positive for NS1 only, 161 showed IgM only while 9 showed IgG only. More than one marker was detected in the remaining 55 samples.

Mutants containing single amino acid substitutions, as well as combinations of mutations, were constructed and analyzed for their virulence in mice, growth properties in cultured cells, and genetic stability. The most significant attenuation in mice was achieved by mutagenesis of threonine 310. Combining this mutation with deletion mutations in the 3′-noncoding region yielded mutants that were highly attenuated. The biological effects of mutation Thr 310 to Lys, however, could be reversed to a large degree by a mutation at a neighboring position (Lys 311 to Glu) that arose spontaneously during infection of a mouse. Mutagenesis of the other positions provided evidence for the functional importance of residue 308 (Asp) and its charge interaction with residue 311 (Lys), whereas residue 309 could be altered or even deleted without any notable consequences. Deletion of residue 309 was accompanied by a spontaneous second-site mutation (Phe to Tyr) at position 332, which in the three-dimensional structure of protein E is spatially close to residue 309.

While immunity to the infecting serotype is long-lived, heterotypic immunity wanes a few months after infection. Epidemiological studies link secondary heterotypic infections with more severe symptoms, and cross-reactive, poorly neutralizing antibodies have been implicated in this increased disease severity. To understand the cellular and functional properties of the acute dengue virus B cell response and its role in protection and immunopathology, we characterized the plasmablast response in four secondary DENV type 2 (DENV2) patients. Dengue plasmablasts had high degrees of somatic hypermutation, with a clear preference for replacement mutations. Clonal expansions were also present in each donor, strongly supporting a memory origin for these acutely induced cells. We generated 53 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from sorted patient plasmablasts and found that DENV-reactive MAbs were largely envelope specific and cross neutralizing. Many more MAbs neutralized DENV than reacted to envelope protein, emphasizing the significance of virion-dependent B cell epitopes and the limitations of envelope protein-based antibody screening. A majority of DENV-reactive MAbs, irrespective of neutralization potency, enhanced infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Interestingly, even though DENV2 was the infecting serotype in all four patients, several MAbs from two patients neutralized DENV1 more potently than DENV2. Further, half of all type-specific neutralizing MAbs were also DENV1 biased in binding. Taken together, these findings are reminiscent of original antigenic sin (OAS), given that the patients had prior dengue virus exposures. These data describe the ongoing B cell response in secondary patients and may further our understanding of the impact of antibodies in dengue virus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE In addition to their role in protection, antibody responses have been hypothesized to contribute to the pathology of dengue. Recent studies characterizing memory B cell (MBC)-derived MAbs have provided valuable insight into the targets and functions of B cell responses generated after DENV exposure. However, in the case of secondary infections, such MBC-based approaches fail to distinguish acutely induced cells from the preexisting MBC pool. Our characterization of plasmablasts and plasmablast-derived MAbs provides a focused analysis of B cell responses activated during ongoing infection. Additionally, our studies provide evidence of OAS in the acute-phase dengue virus immune response, providing a basis for future work examining the impact of OAS phenotype antibodies on protective immunity and disease severity in secondary infections.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The characterization of plasmablasts and plasmablast-derived MAbs provides a focused analysis of B cell responses activated during ongoing infection, and provides evidence of original antigenic sin (OAS) in the acute-phase dengue virus immune response."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2465,"details":{"paperId":"04876e43f4e83b2e0542aac0987d6d27e905bf77","externalIds":{"MAG":"2491460411","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2016.07.014","CorpusId":"2692669","PubMed":"27467579"},"title":"B cells naturally induced during dengue virus infection release soluble CD27, the plasma level of which is associated with severe forms of pediatric dengue.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Increased sCD27 release in cultures of purified polyclonally stimulated B cells supports a potential new role for B cells in dengue pathogenesis, and s CD27 and sCD38 are novel biomarkers associated with clinical outcome during d Dengue virus infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1212,"details":{"paperId":"1fc75755920364fc028ff8bee30427547c901a26","externalIds":{"MAG":"3095240310","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104966","CorpusId":"226241384","PubMed":"33137362"},"title":"BIKE regulates dengue virus infection and is a cellular target for broad-spectrum antivirals.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A requirement for BIKE, but not STK-16, in dengue virus (DENV) infection is revealed and a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of BIKE can be potentially used as a broad-spectrum strategy against acute emerging viral infections is established."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7101,"details":{"paperId":"a37191a07472b38edf5cbc5c8647eeccf4e43058","externalIds":{"MAG":"2920877561","DOI":"10.21474/IJAR01/8534","CorpusId":"127155444"},"title":"BIO EFFICACY OF SPATHODEA CAMPANULATA P.BEAUV.(BIGNONIACEAE) HEXANE LEAF EXTRACT AGAINST DENGUE AND ZIKA VIRUS VECTOR AEDES AEGYPTI (DIPTERA:CULICIDAE).","abstract":"Pravin Y and Mohanraj R.S.

We had found that LPS markedly suppressed DV infection of primary human MO/Mφ when it was added to cultures prior to or together with, but not after, viral adsorption. The inhibitory effect of LPS was direct and specific and was not mediated by LPS-induced secretion of cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, alpha interferon, MIP-1α, and RANTES. In fact, productive DV infection was not blocked but was just postponed by LPS, with a time lag equal to one viral replication cycle. Time course studies demonstrated that LPS was only effective in suppressing DV infection of MO/Mφ that had not been previously exposed to the virus. At various time points after viral adsorption, the level of unbound viruses that remained free in the culture supernatants of LPS-pretreated cultures was much higher than that of untreated controls. These observations suggest that the LPS-induced suppression of DV replication was at the level of virus attachment and/or entry. Blockade of the major LPS receptor, CD14, with monoclonal antibodies MY4 or MoS39 failed to inhibit DV infection but could totally abrogate the inhibitory effect of LPS. Moreover, human serum could significantly enhance the LPS-induced DV suppression in a CD14-dependent manner, indicating that the “binding” of LPS to CD14 was critical for the induction of virus inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that LPS blocked DV entry into human MO/Mφ via its receptor CD14 and that a CD14-associated cell surface structure may be essential for the initiation of a DV infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that LPS blocked DV entry into human MO/Mφ via its receptor CD14 and that a CD14-associated cell surface structure may be essential for the initiation of a DV infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1780,"details":{"paperId":"fcbc1f22e455765897c9f85df9b43f6969f8ff19","externalIds":{"MAG":"2011206425","DOI":"10.1016/J.JCHROMB.2006.08.051","CorpusId":"24839284","PubMed":"17011249"},"title":"Bacterially expressed and refolded envelope protein (domain III) of dengue virus type-4 binds heparan sulfate.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A homology model of dengue-4 envelope protein (domain III) was developed and mapped the possible amino acid residues critical for binding to heparan sulfate and will help in development of bioassay for the proposed vaccine candidate."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3226,"details":{"paperId":"c193dc86635a4f62dff26abb6ac86a9f499ab9a9","externalIds":{"MAG":"2064558921","PubMedCentral":"4071309","DOI":"10.1038/srep05452","CorpusId":"14622585","PubMed":"24965553"},"title":"Baicalin, a metabolite of baicalein with antiviral activity against dengue virus","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In vitro antiviral experiments showed that baicalin as the main metabolite of baicalein exerting in vitro anti-DENV activity and showed anti-adsorption effect with IC50 = 18.07 ± 0.2 μg/ml."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2027,"details":{"paperId":"94d479c2084d7c5d4de6a8f771bf86b4fe5b74a2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2055729637","DOI":"10.1016/j.micinf.2011.06.008","CorpusId":"19348374","PubMed":"21763777"},"title":"Balance of infection-enhancing and neutralizing antibodies induced by a dengue tetravalent DNA vaccine in a mouse model.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The balance of neutralizing and enhancing activities induced by a dengue tetravalent vaccine was analyzed in this study in a DNA vaccine model using mice, finding that enhancing activities were not shown in mice immunized with aDNA vaccine as far as complement was included in the in vitro assay system."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3056,"details":{"paperId":"25607e5fb9d9f6cf742efa8dbda9ebf007c3ffb7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2038682017","DOI":"10.1038/nrmicro3030","CorpusId":"6980991","PubMed":"23652323"},"title":"Barriers to preclinical investigations of anti-dengue immunity and dengue pathogenesis","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Controversy in the field of dengue research relating to the interaction between DENV and the mammalian host is discussed and suggestions for the most effective ways in which the role of the immune system in the protection from, and pathology of, DENV infection can be addressed experimentally are offered."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1329,"details":{"paperId":"ccc01da721df5edfcd38a85533e5ca03a1b15eb2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2112855634","DOI":"10.1016/j.bcp.2015.11.001","CorpusId":"13117222","PubMed":"26551597"},"title":"Basic chemokine-derived glycosaminoglycan binding peptides exert antiviral properties against dengue virus serotype 2, herpes simplex virus-1 and respiratory syncytial virus.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The COOH-terminal peptides of C XCL9 and CXCL12γ have antiviral activity against DENV serotype 2, clinical and laboratory strains of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and it is shown that CXcl9(74-103) competes with DENV envelope protein domain III for binding to heparin."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3562,"details":{"paperId":"01d0be1ae52f4fda37813817aca2777b1c8798a2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2976138411","DOI":"10.1080/14786419.2019.1669030","CorpusId":"203438318","PubMed":"31554433"},"title":"Bauhinia holophylla (Bong.)

The increased prevalence of dengue virus (DENV) infection has had a significant socio-economic impact on epidemic countries. The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has created an international public health emergency because ZIKV infection has been linked to congenital defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome. To develop potentially antiviral drugs for combatting these acute infectious diseases, we have targeted the host calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) for inhibition. By using CaMKII structure-guided inhibitor design, we generated four families of benzenesulfonamide (BSA) derivatives for SAR analysis.

To explore the possibility that compounds inhibiting NS3-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis might function as antivirals even if they do not inhibit RNA unwinding in vitro, we designed a robust dengue virus (DENV) NS3 ATPase assay suitable for high-throughput screening.

Circular dichroism (CD) is a spectroscopic technique which measures differences in the absorption of left-handed and right handed circularly polarized light. The CD spectrum can determine conformation of the NS1 antigen and its antibody, conformational changes of the antigen-antibody interaction and estimates the secondary structure of these proteins in far UV region. Firstly, CD spectrum of individual solutions of the antigen and the antibody were measured. Then, the solutions were mixed to produce a solution of complex dengue NS1 antigen and its antibody for measurement. The findings show that the antibody has the highest positive band of CD intensity follow by the complex antigen-antibody and antigen. The antibody is a chiral structure, has high helical conformation and more ordered epitope structure. Meanwhile, the NS1 antigen shows the negative and the lowest CD spectrum. The antigen is low chirality and has more random-like conformation. The complex (binding of the antigen and antibody) has the CD spectrum's shape similar to the antibody but in lower intensity. So, it has helical and beta conformations lower than the antibody.

In solution and without inhibitors, the functionally important C-terminal segment of the NS2B cofactor is dissociated from DEN NS3pro (\"open state\"), necessitating a large structural change to produce the \"closed state\" thought to underpin activity. We analyzed the fold of DEN NS2B-NS3pro in solution with and without bound inhibitor by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Multiple paramagnetic lanthanide tags were attached to different sites to generate pseudocontact shifts (PCS). In the face of severe spectral overlap and broadening of many signals by conformational exchange, methods for assignment of (15)N-HSQC cross-peaks included selective mutation, combinatorial isotope labeling, and comparison of experimental PCSs and PCSs back-calculated for a structural model of the closed conformation built by using the structure of the related West Nile virus (WNV) protease as a template. The PCSs show that, in the presence of a positively charged low-molecular weight inhibitor, the enzyme assumes a closed state that is very similar to the closed state previously observed for the WNV protease. Therefore, a model of the protease built on the closed conformation of the WNV protease is a better template for rational drug design than available crystal structures, at least for positively charged inhibitors. To assess the open state, we created a binding site for a Gd(3+) complex and measured paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. The results show that the specific open conformation displayed in the crystal of DEN NS2B-NS3pro is barely populated in solution. The techniques used open an avenue to the fold analysis of proteins that yield poor NMR spectra, as PCSs from multiple sites in combination with model building generate powerful information even from incompletely assigned (15)N-HSQC spectra.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A model of the protease built on the closed conformation of the related West Nile virus protease is a better template for rational drug design than available crystal structures, at least for positively charged inhibitors."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1869,"details":{"paperId":"dcebf683f0e2d0c8ec72830b780a29ac699bbce4","externalIds":{"MAG":"282630144","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmgm.2015.05.008","CorpusId":"31593173","PubMed":"26086900"},"title":"Binding specificity of polypeptide substrates in NS2B/NS3pro serine protease of dengue virus type 2: A molecular dynamics Study.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Molecular dynamics simulations of the NS2B/NS3 protease complexes with six peptide substrates of DV type 2 suggested that among the ten substrate residues (P(5)-P( 5)') the P(1) and P(2) subsites play a major role in the binding with the focused protease."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7183,"details":{"paperId":"0baf7463255e45542bbd07c13fb7b1e90385458c","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.22146/ijc.68317","CorpusId":"248248933"},"title":"Bioactive Compound Profile and Biological Modeling Reveals the Potential Role of Purified Methanolic Extract of Sweet Flag (Acorus calamus L.) in Inhibiting the Dengue Virus (DENV) NS3 Protease-Helicase","abstract":"Dengue fever is an infectious disease caused by the dengue virus, and there is no yet effective drug to treat this disease successfully.

Recent reports indicate that there is a significant correlation between virus titer in the bloodstream of infected individuals and the severity of the disease, especially the development of DHF.

In spite of the increasing global incidence, no specific antiviral therapy is available. Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage are the main targets either for direct antibody (Ab)-independent or Ab-mediated human DENV infection, usually associated to the severe forms of disease. Since the virus entry may be a convenient therapeutic alternative, this study aimed to investigate the mode of DENV internalization into myeloid cells in the absence and presence of DENV Ab and evaluate the inhibitory activity of diverse biochemical inhibitors of endocytosis. Methodology/principal findings By infectivity assays and quantitative RT-PCR determinations, it was demonstrated that DENV-2 entry into U937 and K562 cells in the absence of Ab was highly inhibited by the early treatment with ammonium chloride, chlorpromazine and dynasore, but it was not affected by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, indicating that DENV-2 utilizes a low pH-dependent, clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytic infectious pathway for the direct entry into both human myeloid cells. To study the Ab-mediated entry of DENV, the experimental conditions for enhancement of infection were established by inoculating immune complexes formed with DENV-2 and the Ab 2H2 or 3H5. The internalization of DENV-2-2H2 or DENV-2-3H5 complexes in both myeloid cells was also dependent on acid pH and dynamin but a differential requirement of the clathrin-mediated endocytic route was observed depending on the FcγR involved in the complex uptake: the infection through FcγRII was dependent on clathrin-coated vesicles whereas the internalization pathway mediated by FcγRI was independent of clathrin. This property was not serotype-specific. Conclusions/significance DENV entry into myeloid cells in the absence or presence of Ab can be blocked by diverse biochemical inhibitors affecting the cellular factors involved in endocytosis.

DENV and ZIKV cause two of the most wide spread mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world, dengue fever (DENF) and zika fever (ZIKF), respectively. In many regions around the world, both of these diseases can outbreak together and can be lethal as well as life-threatening. Unfortunately, there is no functional and satisfactory vaccine available to combat these viruses. Therefore, in this study, we have attempted to design a blue print of potential multivalent and multipathogenic vaccines using immunoinformatics approach, which can combat both the DENV and ZIKV infections, simultaneously. Initially, three vaccines were designed; containing highly antigenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic epitopes of T-cell (100% conserved) and B-cell from all the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV. In total, nine cytotoxic T-lymphocytic (CTL), nine helper T-lymphocytic (HTL), and seven B-cell lymphocytic (BCL) epitopes were used to construct three vaccines using three different adjuvants, designated as ‘V1’, ‘V2’, and ‘V3’. Later, V3 was found to be the best vaccine construct, determined by molecular docking analysis. Thereafter, several in silico validation studies including molecular dynamics simulation and immune simulation were performed which indicated that V3 might be quite stable and should generate substantial immune response in the biological environment. However, further in vivo and in vitro validation might be required to finally confirm the safety and efficacy of our suggested vaccine constructs. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is present on DC and recognizes N-glycosylation sites on the E-glycoprotein of DENV. Thus, the DC-SIGN/E-glycoprotein interaction can be considered as an important target for inhibitors of viral replication. We evaluated various carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) against all four described serotypes of DENV replication in Raji/DC-SIGN+ cells and in monocyte-derived DC (MDDC). Methodology/Principal Findings A dose-dependent anti-DENV activity of the CBAs Hippeastrum hybrid (HHA), Galanthus nivalis (GNA) and Urtica dioica (UDA), but not actinohivin (AH) was observed against all four DENV serotypes as analyzed by flow cytometry making use of anti-DENV antibodies. Remarkably, the potency of the CBAs against DENV in MDDC cultures was significantly higher (up to 100-fold) than in Raji/DC-SIGN+ cells. Pradimicin-S (PRM-S), a small-size non-peptidic CBA, exerted antiviral activity in MDDC but not in Raji/DC-SIGN+ cells. The CBAs act at an early step of DENV infection as they bind to the viral envelope of DENV and subsequently prevent virus attachment. Only weak antiviral activity of the CBAs was detected when administered after the virus attachment step. The CBAs were also able to completely prevent the cellular activation and differentiation process of MDDC induced upon DENV infection.

In this study, we examine the role of CD4+ T cells during primary DENV infection. Four I-Ab–restricted epitopes derived from three of the nonstructural DENV proteins were identified. CD4+ T cells expanded and were activated after DENV infection, with peak activation occurring on day 7. The DENV-specific CD4+ T cells expressed intracellular IFN-γ, TNF, IL-2, and CD40L, and killed peptide-pulsed target cells in vivo. Surprisingly, depletion of CD4+ T cells before DENV infection had no effect on viral loads. Consistent with this observation, CD4+ T cell depletion did not affect the DENV-specific IgG or IgM Ab titers or their neutralizing activity, or the DENV-specific CD8+ T cell response. However, immunization with the CD4+ T cell epitopes before infection resulted in significantly lower viral loads.

Over a decade of research has highlighted a significant contribution of the T‐cell response to both protection and/or disease enhancement during DENV infection, the latter being mainly associated with sub‐optimal cross‐reactive T‐cell responses during secondary infections. Phase IIb/III clinical trials of the first licensed tetravalent dengue vaccine highlight increased vaccine efficacy in dengue‐immune as opposed to dengue‐naive vaccinees, suggesting a possible immunoprotective role of pre‐existing DENV‐specific T cells that are boosted upon vaccination. No vaccine is available for ZIKV and little is known about the T‐cell response to this virus.

Increased viral infection of DCs was also observed; however, increased infection did not appear to be mediated by DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin, but rather was regulated by decreased production of IFN-α and decreased apoptotic death of infected DCs.

Dengue disease encompasses a wide range of clinical symptoms, usually presenting as an uncomplicated febrile illness lasting 5-7 days; however, a small percentage of infections are associated with plasma leakage and bleeding tendency (called dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF), which can result in shock. Epidemiological studies indicate that severe dengue disease most often occurs during secondary heterotypic DENV infection. Additionally, plasma leakage (the hallmark of DHF) coincides with defervescence and viral clearance, suggesting that severe disease arises from the immune response to infection rather than a direct effect of the virus. A number of studies have found increased levels of markers of immune cell activation in patients with DHF compared to patients with the less severe form of disease (DF).

Infection with one of the four serotypes of DENV results in a transient period of protection against reinfection with all serotypes (cross-protection), followed by lifelong immunity to the infecting serotype. While a protective role for neutralizing antibody responses is well established, the contribution of T cells to reinfection is less clear, especially during heterotypic reinfection. This study investigates the role of T cells during homotypic and heterotypic DENV reinfection. Mice were sequentially infected with homotypic or heterotypic DENV serotypes, and T cell subsets were depleted before the second infection to assess the role of DENV-primed T cells during reinfection. Mice primed nonlethally with DENV were protected against reinfection with either a homotypic or heterotypic serotype 2 weeks later. Homotypic priming induced a robust neutralizing antibody response, whereas heterotypic priming elicited binding, but nonneutralizing antibodies. CD8+ T cells were required for protection against heterotypic, but not homotypic, reinfection. These results suggest that T cells can contribute crucially to protection against heterotypic reinfection in situations where humoral responses alone may not be protective. Our findings have important implications for vaccine design, as they suggest that inducing both humoral and cellular responses during vaccination may maximize protective efficacy across all DENV serotypes. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is present in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical regions. Infection with dengue virus can be asymptomatic, but it can also progress into the potentially lethal severe dengue disease. There are four closely related dengue virus serotypes. Infection with one serotype results in a transient period of resistance against all serotypes (cross-protection), followed by lifelong resistance to the infecting serotype, but not the other ones. The duration and mechanisms of the transient cross-protection period remain elusive. This study investigates the contribution of cellular immunity to cross-protection using mouse models of DENV infection. Our results demonstrate that cellular immunity is crucial to mediate cross-protection against reinfection with a different serotype, but not for protection against reinfection with the same serotype. A better understanding of the mediators responsible for the cross-protection period is important for vaccine design, as an ideal vaccine against dengue virus should efficiently protect against all serotypes.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that T cells can contribute crucially to protection against heterotypic reinfection in situations where humoral responses alone may not be protective, and suggest that inducing both humoral and cellular responses during vaccination may maximize protective efficacy across all DENV serotypes."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8110,"details":{"paperId":"15db63691bbc853d1d6c633fbda10abd343e6cab","externalIds":{"MAG":"1850437202","DOI":"10.4049/jimmunol.1401597","CorpusId":"26646492","PubMed":"25217165"},"title":"CD8+ T Cells Prevent Antigen-Induced Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Disease in Mice","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) causes pathologies ranging from the febrile illness dengue fever to the potentially lethal severe dengue disease. A major risk factor for developing severe dengue disease is the presence of subprotective DENV-reactive Abs from a previous infection (or from an immune mother), which can induce Ab-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE). However, infection in the presence of subprotective anti–DENV Abs does not always result in severe disease, suggesting that other factors influence disease severity. In this study we investigated how CD8+ T cell responses influence the outcome of Ab-mediated severe dengue disease. Mice were primed with aluminum hydroxide–adjuvanted UV-inactivated DENV prior to challenge with DENV. Priming failed to induce robust CD8+ T cell responses, and it induced nonneutralizing Ab responses that increased disease severity upon infection. Transfer of exogenous DENV-activated CD8+ T cells into primed mice prior to infection prevented Ab-dependent enhancement and dramatically reduced viral load.

Serological cross-reactivity has proved to be a challenge to diagnose Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in dengue virus (DENV) endemic countries. Confirmatory testing of ZIKV IgM positive results by plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) provides clarification in only a minority of cases because most individuals infected with ZIKV were previously exposed to DENV. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of a ZIKV/DENV DUO IgM antibody capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) for discriminating between DENV and ZIKV infections in endemic regions. Our performance evaluation included acute and convalescent specimens from patients with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed DENV or ZIKV from the Sentinel Enhanced Dengue Surveillance System in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The ZIKV/DENV DUO MAC-ELISA specificity was 100% for DENV (N = 127) and 98.4% for ZIKV (N = 275) when specimens were tested during the optimal testing window (days post-onset of illness [DPO] 6–120). The ZIKV/DENV DUO MAC-ELISA sensitivity of RT-PCR confirmed specimens reached 100% for DENV by DPO 6 and for ZIKV by DPO 9. Our new ZIKV/DENV DUO MAC-ELISA was also able to distinguish ZIKV and DENV regardless of previous DENV exposure. We conclude this novel serologic diagnostic assay can accurately discriminate ZIKV and DENV infections.

The overall antigenicity of the E products was analyzed by radioimmunoprecipitation, using dengue virus hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF) or an anti-E peptide serum. Truncated E that was 79% or less in length did not bind HMAF efficiently, whereas E constructs greater than 79% were able to bind HMAF with high efficiency. The first 392 amino acids of the dengue type 4 virus E sequence, including the Arg-392 following the 79% E C terminus, appeared to be critical for proper antigenic structure required for efficient binding by HMAF. Truncated E's ranging from 59 to 81% in length were secreted extracellularly, whereas smaller or larger E's were retained intracellularly. Secreted E's contained carbohydrate side chains that were resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion, suggesting that the transport of E occurs via a pathway from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi complex. 79% E-RKG (which possessed the three additional amino acids immediately downstream of 79% E) was expressed at a high concentration on the surface of recombinant virus-infected cells presumably being inserted into the plasma membrane by a hydrophobic C-terminal membrane anchor. Evaluation in mice of the protective efficacy of the various vaccinia virus E recombinants indicated that only truncated E's that were recognized efficiently by HMAF induced a high level of resistance to dengue virus encephalitis. 79% E-RKG which is expressed at a high concentration on the surface of infected cells was highly immunogenic when tested for induction of an E antibody response. This suggests that cell surface expression of 79% E-RKG was responsible for its enhanced immunogenicity. Finally, passive immunization studies indicated that serum antibodies to E played a major role in the complete or nearly complete resistance to dengue virus challenge induced by certain vaccinia virus-truncated E recombinants.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3147,"details":{"paperId":"81d8e570364c1f4a7b6f9d5afbdba90e05dda24c","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-35035-w","CorpusId":"256947935"},"title":"Cardol triene inhibits dengue infectivity by targeting kl loops and preventing envelope fusion","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown for the first time that cardol triene had a potential for further development as anti-dengue inhibitors and kl loops of dengue envelope proteins were major targets."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7752,"details":{"paperId":"645787a6943bae80d0803d469b8b9f60317ea4de","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9030784","DOI":"10.3390/nu14081584","CorpusId":"248142216","PubMed":"35458146"},"title":"Carica papaya Leaf Juice for Dengue: A Scoping Review","abstract":"The potential therapeutic effect of Carica papaya leaf juice has attracted wide interest from the public and scientists in relieving dengue related manifestations.

Although there have been considerable advances in understanding the pathophysiology of these viruses, no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs are currently available. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of carnosine, an endogenous dipeptide (β‐alanyl‐l‐histidine), against DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) and ZIKV infection in human liver cells (Huh7). Computational studies were performed to predict the potential interactions between carnosine and viral proteins. Biochemical and cell‐based assays were performed to validate the computational results. Mode‐of‐inhibition, plaque reduction, and immunostaining assays were performed to determine the antiviral activity of carnosine. Exogenous carnosine showed minimal cytotoxicity in Huh7 cells and rescued the viability of infected cells with EC50 values of 52.3 and 59.5 μM for DENV2 and ZIKV infection, respectively. Based on the mode‐of‐inhibition assays, carnosine inhibited DENV2 mainly by inhibiting viral genome replication and interfering with virus entry. Carnosine antiviral activity was verified with immunostaining assay where carnosine treatment diminished viral fluorescence signal.

The disease is a vector-borne disease, transmitted by the bite of an Aedes spp. mosquito. Dynamic clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic, flu-like febrile illness, dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with or without dengue shock syndrome (DSS), make the disease one of the most challenging to diagnose and treat. DF is a self-limited illness, while DHF/DSS, characterized by plasma leakage resulting from an increased vascular permeability, can have severe consequences, including death. The pathogenesis of dengue virus infection remains poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of a suitable animal model that can recapitulate the cardinal features of human dengue diseases. Currently, there is no specific treatment or antiviral therapy available for dengue virus infection and supportive care with vigilant monitoring is the principle course of treatment. Since vector control programs have been largely unsuccessful in preventing outbreaks, vaccination seems to be the most viable option for prevention. There are four dengue viral serotypes and each one of them is capable of causing severe dengue. Although immunity induced by infection by one serotype is effective in protection against the homologous viral serotype, it only has a transient protective effect against infection with the other three serotypes. The meager cross protective immunity generated wanes over time and may even induce a harmful effect at the time of subsequent secondary infection. Thus, it is imperative to have a vaccine that can elicit equal and long-lasting immunity to all four serotypes simultaneously. Numerous tetravalent vaccines are currently either in the pipeline for clinical trials or under development. For those frontrunner tetravalent vaccines in clinical trials, despite good safety and immunogenicity profiles registered, issues such as imbalanced immune responses between serotypes and questions with regard to whether the optimum formulation have been identified remain unresolved.

The DENV complex antigenic site was located on an upper lateral surface of ED3 that was distinct but overlapped with a previously described DENV-2 type-specific antigenic site on ED3.

Here we report that brequinar has activity against a broad spectrum of viruses. The compound not only inhibits flaviviruses (dengue virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and Powassan virus) but also suppresses a plus-strand RNA alphavirus (Western equine encephalitis virus) and a negative-strand RNA rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus). Using dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) as a model, we found that brequinar suppressed the viral infection cycle mainly at the step of RNA synthesis. Supplementing the culture medium with pyrimidines (cytidine or uridine) but not purines (adenine or guanine) could be used to reverse the inhibitory effect of the compound. Continuous culturing of DENV-2 in the presence of brequinar generated viruses that were partially resistant to the inhibitor. Sequencing of the resistant viruses revealed two amino acid mutations: one mutation (M260V) located at a helix in the domain II of the viral envelope protein and another mutation (E802Q) located at the priming loop of the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase domain. Functional analysis of the mutations suggests that the NS5 mutation exerts resistance through enhancement of polymerase activity. The envelope protein mutation reduced the efficiency of virion assembly/release; however, the mutant virus became less sensitive to brequinar inhibition at the step of virion assembly/release.

However, there is minimal information about the immunological responses in these patients. CD8 T cells are important in dengue, because they have been implicated in both protection and immunopathology. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of HLA-DR+ CD38+ and HLA-DR− CD38+ effector CD8 T cell subsets in dengue patients from India and Thailand. Both CD8 T cell subsets expanded and expressed markers indicative of antigen-driven proliferation, tissue homing, and cytotoxic effector functions, with the HLA-DR+ CD38+ subset being the most striking in these effector qualities. The breadth of the dengue-specific CD8 T cell response was diverse, with NS3-specific cells being the most dominant. Interestingly, only a small fraction of these activated effector CD8 T cells produced gamma interferon (IFN-γ) when stimulated with dengue virus peptide pools. Transcriptomics revealed downregulation of key molecules involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Consistent with this, the majority of these CD8 T cells remained IFN-γ unresponsive even after TCR-dependent polyclonal stimulation (anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28) but produced IFN-γ by TCR-independent polyclonal stimulation (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA] plus ionomycin). Thus, the vast majority of these proliferating, highly differentiated effector CD8 T cells probably acquire TCR refractoriness at the time the patient is experiencing febrile illness that leads to IFN-γ unresponsiveness. Our studies open novel avenues for understanding the mechanisms that fine-tune the balance between CD8 T cell-mediated protective versus pathological effects in dengue. IMPORTANCE Dengue is becoming a global public health concern. Although CD8 T cells have been implicated both in protection and in the cytokine-mediated immunopathology of dengue, how the balance is maintained between these opposing functions remains unknown. We comprehensively characterized CD8 T cell subsets in dengue patients from India and Thailand and show that these cells expand massively and express phenotypes indicative of overwhelming antigenic stimulus and tissue homing/cytotoxic-effector functions but that a vast majority of them fail to produce IFN-γ in vitro. Interestingly, the cells were fully capable of producing the cytokine when stimulated in a T cell receptor (TCR)-independent manner but failed to do so in TCR-dependent stimulation. These results, together with transcriptomics, revealed that the vast majority of these CD8 T cells from dengue patients become cytokine unresponsive due to TCR signaling insufficiencies. These observations open novel avenues for understanding the mechanisms that fine-tune the balance between CD8-mediated protective versus pathological effects.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"CD8 T cell subsets in dengue patients from India and Thailand are comprehensively characterized and it is revealed that these cells expand massively and express phenotypes indicative of overwhelming antigenic stimulus and tissue homing/cytotoxic-effector functions but that the vast majority of them fail to produce IFN-γ in vitro."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6650,"details":{"paperId":"7c315d26f379856c5e3160cea86c954a52f1c9c1","externalIds":{"MAG":"2228441468","PubMedCentral":"4703206","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1005357","CorpusId":"3057617","PubMed":"26735137"},"title":"Characterization of RyDEN (C19orf66) as an Interferon-Stimulated Cellular Inhibitor against Dengue Virus Replication","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most important arthropod-borne pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases in humans. However, no vaccine or specific antiviral is available for dengue. As seen in other RNA viruses, the innate immune system plays a key role in controlling DENV infection and disease outcome. Although the interferon (IFN) response, which is central to host protective immunity, has been reported to limit DENV replication, the molecular details of how DENV infection is modulated by IFN treatment are elusive. In this study, by employing a gain-of-function screen using a type I IFN-treated cell-derived cDNA library, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, C19orf66, as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) that inhibits DENV replication, which we named Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN). Overexpression and gene knockdown experiments revealed that expression of RyDEN confers resistance to all serotypes of DENV in human cells. RyDEN expression also limited the replication of hepatitis C virus, Kunjin virus, Chikungunya virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and human adenovirus. Importantly, RyDEN was considered to be a crucial effector molecule in the IFN-mediated anti-DENV response. When affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis was performed, RyDEN was revealed to form a complex with cellular mRNA-binding proteins, poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), and La motif-related protein 1 (LARP1). Interestingly, PABPC1 and LARP1 were found to be positive modulators of DENV replication. Since RyDEN influenced intracellular events on DENV replication and, suppression of protein synthesis from DENV-based reporter construct RNA was also observed in RyDEN-expressing cells, our data suggest that RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data suggest that RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2474,"details":{"paperId":"513cb35e60c0bf44257040586bdbb8a8d41eb1d5","externalIds":{"MAG":"2610785775","DOI":"10.1016/j.virol.2017.04.031","CorpusId":"30321175","PubMed":"28475924"},"title":"Characterization of Zika virus binding and enhancement potential of a large panel of flavivirus murine monoclonal antibodies.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Only 3 cross-reactive mAbs elicited by exposure with Dengue virus and West Nile virus were able to enhance ZIKV infection in vitro, and enhancing potential was not strictly correlated with relative binding ability."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6512,"details":{"paperId":"611a5079318e9826867fe7e3f5eca2d97197444b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4592203","MAG":"2109796430","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139741","CorpusId":"17180816","PubMed":"26430770"},"title":"Characterization of a Novel Dengue Serotype 4 Virus-Specific Neutralizing Epitope on the Envelope Protein Domain III","abstract":"The dengue virus (DENV) envelope protein domain III (ED3) has been suggested to contain receptor recognition sites and the critical neutralizing epitopes.

The predominant antibody subclass for the D/D/D mice was immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a, similar to mice infected with live virus. The R/R/R mice showed an exclusive IgGI antibody response, and the RD/RD/RD response also was predominantly IgGI. The antibody subclass pattern of the R/D/D and D/R/R mice showed a more balanced distribution of both IgG1 and IgG2a. Investigating the neutralizing capacity of antibody subclasses suggested that both IgG1 and IgG2a could neutralize DEN-2 virus.

In spite of attempts to develop vaccine candidates and antiviral drugs, there is a lack of approved therapeutics for the treatment of DV infection. We have previously reported the identification of ST-148, a small-molecule inhibitor exhibiting broad and potent antiviral activity against DV in vitro and in vivo (C. M. Byrd et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 57:15–25, 2013, doi:10 .1128/AAC.01429-12). In the present study, we investigated the mode of action of this promising compound by using a combination of biochemical, virological, and imaging-based techniques. We confirmed that ST-148 targets the capsid protein and obtained evidence of bimodal antiviral activity affecting both assembly/release and entry of infectious DV particles. Importantly, by using a robust bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay, we observed an ST-148-dependent increase of capsid self-interaction. These results were corroborated by molecular modeling studies that also revealed a plausible model for compound binding to capsid protein and inhibition by a distinct resistance mutation. These results suggest that ST-148-enhanced capsid protein self-interaction perturbs assembly and disassembly of DV nucleocapsids, probably by inducing structural rigidity. Thus, as previously reported for other enveloped viruses, stabilization of capsid protein structure is an attractive therapeutic concept that also is applicable to flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE Dengue viruses are arthropod-borne viruses representing a significant global health burden. They infect up to 400 million people and are endemic to subtropical and tropical areas of the world. Currently, there are neither vaccines nor approved therapeutics for the prophylaxis or treatment of DV infections, respectively. This study reports the characterization of the mode of action of ST-148, a small-molecule capsid inhibitor with potent antiviral activity against all DV serotypes. Our results demonstrate that ST-148 stabilizes capsid protein self-interaction, thereby likely perturbing assembly and disassembly of viral nucleocapsids by inducing structural rigidity. This, in turn, might interfere with the release of viral RNA from incoming nucleocapsids (uncoating) as well as assembly of progeny virus particles. As previously reported for other enveloped viruses, we propose the capsid as a novel tractable target for flavivirus inhibitors.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The mode of action of ST-148, a small-molecule capsid inhibitor with potent antiviral activity against all DV serotypes is investigated by using a combination of biochemical, virological, and imaging-based techniques to demonstrate that it stabilizes capsid protein self-interaction."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1133,"details":{"paperId":"538510eea8f02f9ec6707125fc48dd15453be2f9","externalIds":{"MAG":"2070088129","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.002","CorpusId":"28951523","PubMed":"25614455"},"title":"Characterization of the activity of 2'-C-methylcytidine against dengue virus replication.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A nucleoside analog, 2'-C-methylcytidine (2CMC), is reported, which exerts potent anti-DENV activity in DENV subgenomic RNA replicon and infectious systems, with an IC50 value of 11.2±0.3μM."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3839,"details":{"paperId":"5167804213644a9f53009b40dbc667f1f3b8dd6d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3037325376","DOI":"10.1093/infdis/jiaa346","CorpusId":"219990807","PubMed":"32572472"},"title":"Characterization of the type-specific and cross-reactive B cell responses elicited by a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine.","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nDengue is caused by four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4).

In a previous study, repertoire cloning to recover Fab fragments from bone marrow mRNA of chimpanzees infected with all four DENV serotypes (dengue virus serotype 1 [DENV-1] to DENV-4) was described. In that study, a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that efficiently neutralized DENV-4 was recovered and characterized. In this study, the phage library constructed from the chimpanzees was used to recover Fab antibodies against the other three DENV serotypes. Serotype-specific neutralizing Fabs were not identified. Instead, we recovered DENV-neutralizing Fabs that specifically precipitated the envelope protein and were cross-reactive with all four DENV serotypes. Three of the Fabs competed with each other for binding to DENV-1 and DENV-2, although each of these Fabs contained a distinct complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3)-H sequence. Fabs that shared an identical or nearly identical CDR3-H sequences cross-neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a similar high 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) titer, ranging from 0.26 to 1.33 μg/ml, and neutralized DENV-3 and DENV-4 but at a titer 10- to 20-fold lower. One of these Fabs, 1A5, also neutralized the West Nile virus most efficiently among other flaviviruses tested. Fab 1A5 was converted to a full-length antibody in combination with human sequences for production in mammalian CHO cells. Humanized IgG1 1A5 proved to be as efficient as Fab 1A5 for cross-neutralization of DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a titer of 0.48 and 0.95 μg/ml, respectively. IgG1 1A5 also neutralized DENV-3, DENV-4, and the West Nile virus at a PRNT50 titer of approximately 3.2 to 4.2 μg/ml.

It was found that a dose of 50 μg/mL of CLQ was not toxic to the cells and resulted in significantly less virus production in infected U937 cells than occurred in untreated cells. In the present work, CLQ was effective against DENV‐2 replication in U937 cells, and also caused a statistically significant reduction in expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The present study indicates that CLQ may be used to reduce viral yield in U937 cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It was found that a dose of 50 μg/mL of CLQ was not toxic to the cells and resulted in significantly less virus production in infected U937 cells than occurred in untreated cells, and also caused a statistically significant reduction in expression of proinflammatory cytokines."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6846,"details":{"paperId":"974de2ddd9575e32633a8038613f4e8f4333a70f","externalIds":{"MAG":"1989447608","PubMedCentral":"3970591","DOI":"10.1590/0074-0276108052013010","CorpusId":"5252101","PubMed":"23903975"},"title":"Chloroquine use improves dengue-related symptoms","abstract":"Dengue is the most important arboviral disease in the world.

Lipid rafts, cholesterol-enriched lipid-ordered membrane domains, are platforms for a variety of cellular functions. In this study, we found that disruption of lipid raft formation by cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or cholesterol chelation with filipin III reduces JEV and DEN-2 infection, mainly at the intracellular replication steps and, to a lesser extent, at viral entry. Using a membrane flotation assay, we found that several flaviviral nonstructural proteins are associated with detergent-resistant membrane structures, indicating that the replication complex of JEV and DEN-2 localizes to the membranes that possess the lipid raft property. Interestingly, we also found that addition of cholesterol readily blocks flaviviral infection, a result that contrasts with previous reports of other viruses, such as Sindbis virus, whose infectivity is enhanced by cholesterol. Cholesterol mainly affected the early step of the flavivirus life cycle, because the presence of cholesterol during viral adsorption greatly blocked JEV and DEN-2 infectivity. Flavirial entry, probably at fusion and RNA uncoating steps, was hindered by cholesterol.

Insect-bacteria associations have been shown to influence vector competence for human pathogens through multi-faceted actions that include the elicitation of the insect immune system, pathogen sequestration by microbes, and bacteria-produced anti-pathogenic factors. These influences make the mosquito microbiota highly interesting from a disease control perspective. Here we present a bacterium of the genus Chromobacterium (Csp_P), which was isolated from the midgut of field-caught Aedes aegypti. Csp_P can effectively colonize the mosquito midgut when introduced through an artificial nectar meal, and it also inhibits the growth of other members of the midgut microbiota. Csp_P colonization of the midgut tissue activates mosquito immune responses, and Csp_P exposure dramatically reduces the survival of both the larval and adult stages. Ingestion of Csp_P by the mosquito significantly reduces its susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum and dengue virus infection, thereby compromising the mosquito's vector competence. This bacterium also exerts in vitro anti-Plasmodium and anti-dengue activities, which appear to be mediated through Csp_P -produced stable bioactive factors with transmission-blocking and therapeutic potential.

In tropical countries such as India where periodic dengue outbreaks can be correlated to the high prevalence of the mosquito vector, circulation of all four dengue viruses (DENVs) and the high population density, a drug for dengue is being increasingly recognized as an unmet public health need. Methodology/Principal findings Using the knowledge of traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, we developed a systematic bioassay-guided screening approach to explore the indigenous herbal bio-resource to identify plants with pan-DENV inhibitory activity. Our results show that the alcoholic extract of Cissampelos pariera Linn (Cipa extract) was a potent inhibitor of all four DENVs in cell-based assays, assessed in terms of viral NS1 antigen secretion using ELISA, as well as viral replication, based on plaque assays. Virus yield reduction assays showed that Cipa extract could decrease viral titers by an order of magnitude. The extract conferred statistically significant protection against DENV infection using the AG129 mouse model. A preliminary evaluation of the clinical relevance of Cipa extract showed that it had no adverse effects on platelet counts and RBC viability. In addition to inherent antipyretic activity in Wistar rats, it possessed the ability to down-regulate the production of TNF-α, a cytokine implicated in severe dengue disease. Importantly, it showed no evidence of toxicity in Wistar rats, when administered at doses as high as 2g/Kg body weight for up to 1 week.

Currently, no effective vaccine or drug is available for the prevention or treatment of dengue, which leaves only anti-mosquito strategies to combat this disease. The present study was initiated to determine the in-vitro and in vivo protective effects of a plant-derived phytopharmaceutical drug for the treatment of dengue. Methodology/Principal Findings In our previous report, we had identified methanolic extract of the aerial parts of Cissampelos pareira to exhibit in vitro and in vivo anti-dengue activity against all the four DENV serotypes. In the current study, we have identified another Indian medicinal plant, Cocculus hirsutus, which has a more potent anti-dengue activity than C. pareira. The activity has been evaluated through flow-cytometry-based virus inhibition assay. Interestingly, the stem of C. hirsutus was found to be more potent than the aerial part irrespective of the extraction solvent used viz., denatured spirit, hydro-alcohol (50:50) and water. Hence, the aqueous extract of stem of C. hirsutus (AQCH) was further advanced for investigations because of greater regulatory acceptance. The AQCH exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of release of DENV and its secretory antigen, NS1. Five chemical markers viz. Sinococuline, 20-Hydroxyecdysone, Makisterone-A, Magnoflorine and Coniferyl alcohol were identified as the major chemical ingredients of the AQCH extract. These chemicals were subsequently used for extract standardisation. Importantly, AQCH completely protected AG129 mice at 25 mg/kg/dose body weight when fed 4 times a day post-infection with a lethal dose of DENV-2 S221 strain. Because of its potential as an effective phytopharmaceutical drug against dengue, AQCH, has been formulated into tablets for further pre-clinical and clinical developments. Conclusions/Significance We provide evidence of the pan anti-dengue potential of C. hirsutus-based phytopharmaceutical drug as determined through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We have also characterized five chemical entities in the drug substance, which provides means for standardization of drug substance and drug product. Based on these findings, a program to develop a safe and effective C. hirsutus-derived phytopharmaceutical drug for the treatment of dengue has been initiated. Author summary There is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective drug against dengue, which is a rapidly expanding mosquito-borne viral disease. Half of the world’s population has been estimated to be at risk of contracting this disease and the situation remains grim due to lack of an approved drug. We aimed to develop an ethnopharmacological drug against dengue by exploring traditional Indian medicinal science, Ayurveda. This led us to identify a creeper, Cocculus hirsutus, as a more potent anti-dengue plant than Cissampelos pareira, reported in our earlier published study. The stem part of C. hirsutus was found to be more efficacious in inhibiting the propagation of dengue viruses (DENVs) in cell culture than its aerial part. Hence, we chose to advance aqueous extract of stem of C. hirsutus (AQCH) for further studies. Importantly, AQCH also protected immune-compromised mice from lethal DENV infection, which is suggestive of its potential clinical relevance. We have identified five chemical marker compounds in AQCH to gauge the quality and consistency of extract preparation and its formulation into stable tablets.

DENV nonstructural protein (NS) 1 has been considered to be a desirable vaccine candidate for its ability to induce Ab and complement-dependent cytolysis of DENV-infected cells as well as to block the pathogenic effects of NS1. However a potential drawback of NS1 as a vaccine is that anti-DENV NS1 Abs can lead to endothelial cell damage and platelet dysfunction by antigenic cross-reactivity. Therefore, we modified the DENV NS1 by replacing the C-terminal cross-reactive epitopes with the corresponding region of Japanese encephalitis virus NS1 to generate a chimeric DJ NS1 protein.

Screening was based solely on the structural information of the Dengue virus envelope protein and was focused on a target site that is presumably important for the conformational rearrangements necessary for viral entry. To circumvent the issue of lead compound toxicity, we performed screening based on molecular docking using structural databases of medical compounds. To enhance the identification of hits, we further categorized and selected candidates according to their novel structural characteristics. Finally, the selected candidates were subjected to a biological validation assay to assess inhibition of Dengue virus propagation in mammalian host cells using a plaque formation assay. Among the 10 compounds examined, rolitetracycline and doxycycline significantly inhibited plaque formation, demonstrating their inhibitory effect on dengue virus propagation. Both compounds were tetracycline derivatives with IC50s estimated to be 67.1 µM and 55.6 µM, respectively. Their docked conformations displayed common hydrophobic interactions with critical residues that affected membrane fusion during viral entry.

Using West Nile (WNV) and dengue (DENV) viruses produced under conditions that modify the extent of virion maturation, we investigated time-dependent changes in neutralization sensitivity associated with structural dynamics. Our results identify distinct patterns of neutralization against viruses that vary markedly with respect to the extent of virion maturation. Reducing the efficiency of virion maturation resulted in greater time-dependent changes in neutralization potency and a marked reduction in the stability of the particle at 37°C compared to more mature virus. The fact that the neutralization sensitivity of WNV and DENV did not increase after prolonged incubation in the absence of antibody, regardless of virion maturation, suggests that the dynamic processes that govern epitope accessibility on infectious viruses are reversible. Against the backdrop of heterogeneous flavivirus structures, differences in the pathways by which viruses “breathe” represent an additional layer of complexity in understanding maturation state-dependent patterns of antibody recognition. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses exist as a group of related structures at equilibrium that arise from the dynamic motion of E proteins that comprise the antigenic surface of the mature virion. This process has been characterized for numerous viruses and is referred to as viral “breathing.” Additionally, flaviviruses are structurally heterogeneous due to an inefficient maturation process responsible for cleaving prM on the virion surface. Both of these mechanisms vary the exposure of antigenic sites available for antibody binding and impact the ability of antibodies to neutralize infection. We demonstrate that virions with inefficient prM cleavage “breathe” differently than their more mature counterparts, resulting in distinct patterns of neutralization sensitivity. Additionally, the maturation state was found to impact virus stability in solution. Our findings provide insight into the complex flavivirus structures that contribute to infection with the potential to impact antibody recognition.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that virions with inefficient prM cleavage “breathe” differently than their more mature counterparts, resulting in distinct patterns of neutralization sensitivity, which provide insight into the complex flavivirus structures that contribute to infection with the potential to impact antibody recognition."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8753,"details":{"paperId":"055c101421a2248186719019491ca9c033143a50","externalIds":{"MAG":"3008097345","DOI":"10.9734/ajrid/2020/v3i230123","CorpusId":"212700717"},"title":"Commentary on Article: Efficacy of a Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Children and Adolescents (NEJM, Nov 21 2019)","abstract":"In this Letter to the Editor, this author comments on the article in the NEJM (Nov 21 2019) in the above title on the TAK-003 Dengue vaccine Phase III trial from a point of comparing with the predecessor, the CYD-TDV, beside comparing the TAK-003 and Severe dengue, and the TAK-003 and hospitalizations.

Currently, there is no clinically approved therapeutic drug available for this acute viral infection. Although the first dengue vaccine Dengvaxia has been approved for use in certain countries, it is limited to those without a previous dengue infection while the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in those elderly and younger children still need to be identified. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to develop therapeutics/drugs to combat dengue virus (DENV) infection. YK51 is a synthetic analogue of 4-Hydroxypandurantin A (a compound found in the crude extract of the rhizomes of Boesenbergia rotunda) that has been extensively studied by our research group. It has been shown to possess outstanding antiviral activity due to its inhibitory activity against NS2B/NS3 DENV2 protease. However, it is not known how YK51 affects the proteome of DENV infected cells. Therefore, we performed a comparative proteomics analysis to identify changes in protein expression in DENV infected HepG2 cells treated with YK51. Classical two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by protein identification using tandem mass spectrometry was employed in this study. Thirty proteins were found to be down-regulated with YK51 treatment. In silico analysis predicted that the down-regulation of eight of these proteins may inhibit viral infection. Our results suggested that apart from inhibiting the NS2B/NS3 DENV2 protease, YK51 may also be causing the down-regulation of a number of proteins that may be responsible in, and/or essential to virus infection.

Thus, the development of safe and effective dengue vaccines is a priority according to the World Health Organization. Only one anti-dengue vaccine has already been licensed in endemic countries and two formulations are under phase III clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to compare the main anti-dengue virus vaccines, DENGVAXIA®, LAV-TDV, and TAK-003, regarding their antigens and potential to protect. We studied the conservation of both, B and T cell epitopes involved in immunological control of DENV infection along with vaccine viruses and viral isolates. In addition, we assessed the population coverage of epitope sets contained in each vaccine formulation with regard to different human populations. As main results, we found that all three vaccines contain the main B cell epitopes involved in viral neutralization. Similarly, LAV-TDV and TAK-003 contain most of T cell epitopes involved in immunological protection, a finding not observed in DENGVAXIA®, which explains main limitations of the only licensed dengue vaccine. In summary, the levels of presence and absence of epitopes that are target for protective immune response in the three main anti-dengue virus vaccines are shown in this study.

NS1, NS3, and NS5 (A. A. Khromykh et al., J. Virol. 74:3253-3263, 2000). In this study we have mapped further the minimal region in the NS5 gene essential for efficient trans-complementation of genome-length RNAs in repBHK cells to the first 316 of the 905 codons. To allow amplification and easy detection of complemented defective RNAs with deletions apparently affecting virus assembly, we have developed a dual replicon complementation system. In this system defective replicon RNAs with a deletion(s) in the nonstructural genes also encoded the puromycin resistance gene (PAC gene) and the reporter gene for β-galactosidase (β-Gal). Complementation of these defective replicon RNAs in repBHK cells resulted in expression of PAC and β-Gal which allowed establishment of cell lines stably producing replicating defective RNAs by selection with puromycin and comparison of replication efficiencies of complemented defective RNAs by β-Gal assay. Using this system we demonstrated that deletions in the C-terminal 434 codons of NS3 (codons 178 to 611) were complemented for RNA replication, while any deletions in the first 178 codons were not. None of the genome-length RNAs containing deletions in NS3 shown to be complementable for RNA replication produced secreted defective viruses during complementation in repBHK cells. In contrast, structural proteins produced from these complemented defective RNAs were able to package helper replicon RNA.

The recent phase 2b and 3 studies of a tetravalent dengue vaccine reported a moderate efficacy despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, highlighting the need for a better understanding of neutralizing antibodies in polyclonal human sera. Certain type-specific (TS) antibodies were recently discovered to account for the monotypic neutralizing activity and protection after primary DENV infection. The nature of neutralizing antibodies after secondary DENV infection remains largely unknown. In this study, we examined sera from 10 vaccinees with well-documented exposure to first and second DENV serotypes through heterotypic immunization with live-attenuated vaccines. Higher serum IgG avidities to both exposed and nonexposed serotypes were found after secondary immunization than after primary immunization. Using a two-step depletion protocol to remove different anti-envelope antibodies, including group-reactive (GR) and complex-reactive (CR) antibodies separately, we found GR and CR antibodies together contributed to more than 50% of neutralizing activities against multiple serotypes after secondary immunization. Similar findings were demonstrated in patients after secondary infection. Anti-envelope antibodies recognizing previously exposed serotypes consisted of a large proportion of GR antibodies, CR antibodies, and a small proportion of TS antibodies, whereas those recognizing nonexposed serotypes consisted of GR and CR antibodies. These findings have implications for sequential heterotypic immunization or primary immunization of DENV-primed individuals as alternative strategies for DENV vaccination. The complexity of neutralizing antibodies after secondary infection provides new insights into the difficulty of their application as surrogates of protection. IMPORTANCE The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) are the leading cause of arboviral diseases in humans. Despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, a moderate efficacy was recently reported in phase 2b and 3 trials of a dengue vaccine; a better understanding of neutralizing antibodies in polyclonal human sera is urgently needed. We studied vaccinees who received heterotypic immunization of live-attenuated vaccines, as they were known to have received the first and second DENV serotype exposures.

Decades of research in the related Dengue virus (DENV), finally culminating in a vaccine registered for use in endemic regions (CYD-TDV) in three countries, provides key insights in developing strategies for tackling ZIKV, which has caused global panic to microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, the causal agent of the self-limiting Dengue fever and the potentially fatal hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, has been a scourge in tropical countries for many centuries. The recently solved structure of mature ZIKV (PDB ID:5IRE) has provided key insights into the structure of the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. The previously established MEPP methodology compares two conformations of the same protein and identifies residues with significant spatial and electrostatic perturbations. In the current work, MEPP analyzed the pre-and post-fusion DENV type 2 envelope (E) protein, and identified several known epitopes (His317, Tyr299, Glu26, Arg188, etc.) (MEPPitope). These residues are overwhelmingly conserved in ZIKV and all DENV serotypes, and also enumerates residue pairs that undergo significant polarity reversal. Characterization of α-helices in E-proteins show that α1 is not conserved in the sequence space of ZIKV and DENV. Furthermore, perturbation of α1 in the post-fusion DENV structure includes a known epitope Asp215, a residue absent in the pre-fusion α1. A cationic β-sheet in the GAG-binding domain that is stereochemically equivalent in ZIKV and all DENV serotypes is also highlighted due to a residue pair (Arg286-Arg288) that has a significant electrostatic polarity reversal upon fusion. Finally, two highly conserved residues (Thr32 and Thr40), with little emphasis in existing literature, are found to have significant electrostatic perturbation. Thus, a combination of different computational methods enable the rapid and rational detection of critical residues as epitopes in the search for an elusive therapy or vaccine that neutralizes multiple members of the Flaviviridae family. These secondary structures are conserved in the related Dengue virus (DENV), and possibly rationalize isolation techniques particle adsorption on magnetic beads coated with anionic polymers and anionic antiviral agents (viprolaxikine) for DENV. These amphipathic α-helices could enable design of molecules for inhibiting α-helix mediated protein-protein interactions. Finally, comparison of these secondary structures in proteins from related families illuminate subtle changes in the proteins that might render them ineffective to previously successful drugs and vaccines, which are difficult to identify by a simple sequence or structural alignment.

Promising compounds are selected for further \nexperimental characterization and the inhibitory activity of the two most active \ncompounds is confirmed. \nFor obtaining a better understanding of the molecular basis of the target \nenzyme's function, molecular dynamics simulations and mixed quantum \nmechanics/molecular mechanics calculations are employed to investigate the \nmechanisms of the enzymatically catalyzed reaction at an atomistic level. Based \non a structural model of the target protein in complex with its RNA substrate, \nthe impact of mutations on ligand binding, geometric arrangements and reaction \nenergy barriers are evaluated computationally. In addition, for a detailed \ncharacterization of the underlying chemical reactions, ab initio electronic \nstructure calculations are performed on model systems approximating the \nbiological structure. \nThe reliable prediction of ligand binding sites is crucial for characterizing \nproteins with unknown function. Therefore, the use of computational predictions \nof protein function and ligand binding sites for proteins without experimental \nstructures are assessed in a blind and objective way. Limitations in the current \nprediction methods are analyzed and suggestions for a more reliable evaluation \nare given. Following those suggestions, an extended and fully automated \nassessment is implemented in the Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn (CAMEO) \nframework. \nComputational identification of protein-ligand interactions can greatly \nfacilitate the drug discovery process. Thus, we establish a straightforward, \nrapid scoring function that aims to identify the best poses out of an ensemble \nof pre-docked poses, by quantifying the degree of burial and the electrostatic \ninteractions of the ligand in a binding site.

Variability is uneven across the genome because mutations resulting in a deleterious effect on viral fitness are restricted. RNA viruses are thus marked by protein sites permissive to multiple mutations and sites critical to viral structure-function that are evolutionarily robust and highly conserved. Identification and characterization of the historical dynamics of the conserved sites have relevance to multiple applications, including potential targets for diagnosis, and prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe a large-scale identification and analysis of evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid sequences of the entire dengue virus (DENV) proteome, with a focus on sequences of 9 amino acids or more, and thus immune-relevant as potential T-cell determinants. DENV protein sequence data were collected from the NCBI Entrez protein database in 2005 (9,512 sequences) and again in 2007 (12,404 sequences). Forty-four (44) sequences (pan-DENV sequences), mainly those of nonstructural proteins and representing ∼15% of the DENV polyprotein length, were identical in 80% or more of all recorded DENV sequences. Of these 44 sequences, 34 (∼77%) were present in ≥95% of sequences of each DENV type, and 27 (∼61%) were conserved in other Flaviviruses. The frequencies of variants of the pan-DENV sequences were low (0 to ∼5%), as compared to variant frequencies of ∼60 to ∼85% in the non pan-DENV sequence regions. We further showed that the majority of the conserved sequences were immunologically relevant: 34 contained numerous predicted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertype-restricted peptide sequences, and 26 contained T-cell determinants identified by studies with HLA-transgenic mice and/or reported to be immunogenic in humans. Conclusions/Significance Forty-four (44) pan-DENV sequences of at least 9 amino acids were highly conserved and identical in 80% or more of all recorded DENV sequences, and the majority were found to be immune-relevant by their correspondence to known or putative HLA-restricted T-cell determinants. The conservation of these sequences through the entire recorded DENV genetic history supports their possible value for diagnosis, prophylactic and/or therapeutic applications.

RepliVAX can be propagated in cells that express high levels of C but undergoes only a single cycle of infection in vaccinated hosts. Here we report that we have adapted our RepliVAX technology to produce a dengue vaccine by replacing the prM/E genes of RepliVAX WN (a West Nile virus [WNV] RepliVAX) with the same genes of dengue virus type 2 (DENV2). Our first RepliVAX construct for dengue virus (RepliVAX D2) replicated poorly in WNV C-expressing cells. However, addition of mutations in prM and E that were selected during blind passage of a RepliVAX D2 derivative was used to produce a second-generation RepliVAX D2 (designated D2.2) that displayed acceptable growth in WNV C-expressing cells. RepliVAX D2.2 grew better in DENV2 C-expressing cells than WNV C-expressing cells, but after several passages in DENV2 C-expressing cells it acquired further mutations that permitted efficient growth in WNV C-expressing cells. We tested the potency and efficacy of RepliVAX D2.2 in a well-described immunodeficient mouse model for dengue (strain AG129; lacking the receptors for both type I and type II interferons). These mice produced dose-dependent DENV2-neutralizing antibody responses when vaccinated with RepliVAX D2.2. When challenged with 240 50% lethal doses of DENV2, mice given a single inoculation of RepliVAX D2.2 survived significantly longer than sham-vaccinated animals, although some of these severely immunocompromised mice eventually died from the challenge.

At present, the control of dengue disease is mainly hampered by the absence of antivirals or a vaccine, which results in an estimated half worldwide population at risk of infection. The immune response against DENV is not yet fully understood and a better knowledge of it is now recognized as one of the main challenge for vaccine development. In previous studies, we reported that a DNA vaccine containing the signal peptide sequence from the human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) fused to the DENV2 NS1 gene (pcTPANS1) induced protection against dengue in mice. In the present work, we aimed to elucidate the contribution of cellular and humoral responses elicited by this vaccine candidate for protective immunity. We observed that pcTPANS1 exerts a robust protection against dengue, inducing considerable levels of anti-NS1 antibodies and T cell responses. Passive immunization with anti-NS1 antibodies conferred partial protection in mice infected with low virus load (4 LD50), which was abrogated with the increase of viral dose (40 LD50). The pcTPANS1 also induced activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We detected production of IFN-γ and a cytotoxic activity by CD8+ T lymphocytes induced by this vaccine, although its contribution in the protection was not so evident when compared to CD4+ cells. Depletion of CD4+ cells in immunized mice completely abolished protection. Furthermore, transfer experiments revealed that animals receiving CD4+ T cells combined with anti-NS1 antiserum, both obtained from vaccinated mice, survived virus infection with survival rates not significantly different from pcTPANS1-immunized animals. Taken together, results showed that the protective immune response induced by the expression of NS1 antigen mediated by the pcTPANS1 requires a cooperation between CD4+ T cells and the humoral immunity.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results showed that the protective immune response induced by the expression of NS1 antigen mediated by the pcTPANS1 requires a cooperation between CD4+ T cells and the humoral immunity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7741,"details":{"paperId":"5b36cfb506f1c45cc4ffb880809469c6cb200c73","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8197141","MAG":"3164787582","DOI":"10.3390/molecules26113118","CorpusId":"235301745","PubMed":"34071102"},"title":"Cordycepin Inhibits Virus Replication in Dengue Virus-Infected Vero Cells","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes mild to severe illness in humans that can lead to fatality in severe cases. Currently, no specific drug is available for the treatment of DENV infection. Thus, the development of an anti-DENV drug is urgently required. Cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine), which is a major bioactive compound in Cordyceps (ascomycete) fungus that has been used for centuries in Chinese traditional medicine, was reported to exhibit antiviral activity. However, the anti-DENV activity of cordycepin is unknown. We hypothesized that cordycepin exerts anti-DENV activity and that, as an adenosine derivative, it inhibits DENV replication. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the anti-DENV activity of cordycepin in DENV-infected Vero cells. Cordycepin treatment significantly decreased DENV protein at a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 26.94 μM. Moreover, DENV RNA was dramatically decreased in cordycepin-treated Vero cells, indicating its effectiveness in inhibiting viral RNA replication. Via in silico molecular docking, the binding of cordycepin to DENV non-structural protein 5 (NS5), which is an important enzyme for RNA synthesis, at both the methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains, was predicted.

In our analysis, we investigated several vaccination programs, including routine vaccination, with various vaccine coverage levels and those with and without large catch-up campaigns. As it is unclear whether the vaccine protects against infection or just against disease, our model incorporated both direct and indirect effects of vaccination. We found that in the presence of vaccine-induced indirect protection, the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination decreased with increasing vaccine coverage levels because the marginal returns of herd immunity decreases with vaccine coverage. All routine dengue vaccination programs that we considered were cost-effective, reducing dengue incidence significantly. Specifically, a routine dengue vaccination of 9-year-olds would be cost-effective when the cost of vaccination per individual is less than $262. Furthermore, the combination of routine vaccination and large catch-up campaigns resulted in a greater reduction of dengue burden (by up to 93%) than routine vaccination alone, making it a cost-effective intervention as long as the cost per course of vaccination is $255 or less.

This study was aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in Indonesia whilst taking Wolbachia and health education programs into account. An age-structured decision tree model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness. Approximately 4,701,100 children were followed-up in a 10-year time horizon within a 1-year analytical cycle. We compared three vaccination strategies: one focussing on vaccination only, another combining vaccination and a Wolbachia program, and a third scenario combining vaccination and health education. All scenarios were compared with a no-intervention strategy. The result showed that only vaccination would reduce dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) by 123,203; 97,140 and 283 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $10.3 million and $6.2 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The combination of vaccination and a Wolbachia program would reduce DF, DHF and DSS by 292,488; 230,541; and 672 cases, respectively. It would also save treatment cost at $24.3 million and $14.6 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively.

ICERs from the payer perspective were slightly higher. It can be concluded that vaccination combined with a Wolbachia program was confirmed to be the most cost-effective intervention.

Recent findings DENVs are arboviral flaviviruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes causing a spectrum of clinical disease. DENV infections are a significant global health problem; the WHO estimates that more than 120 countries have endemic DENV transmission resulting in 70–500 million infections, 2.1 million clinically severe cases, and 21 000 deaths annually.

The DENV–host interaction of infection is unique with severe disease a consequence of sequential dengue infection, viral immune evasion, host antibody enhancement, host immune activation, and genetic predisposition. This unique pathogen–host interaction complicates dengue vaccine development and creates provocative questions in vaccine development such as identifying markers of protective immunogenicity, the potential role of antibody in vaccine failures, and the possible impact of large-scale vaccination on the evolution of wild-type DENV.

Dejnirattisai et al. (p. 745) derived a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for dengue viruses. These antibodies were mainly directed against the dengue virus precursor membrane protein (prM), and most cross-reacted with all four dengue serotypes. The antibodies were not capable of fully neutralizing the virus, but instead promoted immune responses over a wide range of concentrations. During virus production and virion assembly, maturation of prm is often incomplete, and, consequently, a major part of the host's natural antibody response recognizes a component that is present in variable numbers on the virion. Thus, rather than resulting in complete neutralization, the antibody response promotes virus infection of cells that carry receptors for antibodies. Variable maturation of a dengue viral antigen results in incomplete neutralization and promotes secondary pathology. Dengue virus co-circulates as four serotypes, and sequential infections with more than one serotype are common. One hypothesis for the increased severity seen in secondary infections is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) leading to increased replication in Fc receptor–bearing cells. In this study, we have generated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies to dengue virus. Antibodies to the structural precursor-membrane protein (prM) form a major component of the response. These antibodies are highly cross-reactive among the dengue virus serotypes and, even at high concentrations, do not neutralize infection but potently promote ADE. We propose that the partial cleavage of prM from the viral surface reduces the density of antigen available for viral neutralization, leaving dengue viruses susceptible to ADE by antibody to prM, a finding that has implications for future vaccine design.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is proposed that the partial cleavage of prM from the viral surface reduces the density of antigen available for viral neutralization, leaving dengue viruses susceptible to ADE by antibody to prM, a finding that has implications for future vaccine design."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6029,"details":{"paperId":"efdc0077bdbdbb9cdb901ef4ddeef8e33d94e80a","externalIds":{"MAG":"133047933","DOI":"10.13028/T0X5-AZ54","CorpusId":"83093224"},"title":"Cross-Reactive Memory CD4 + and CD8 + T Cells Alter the Immune Response to Heterologous Secondary Dengue Virus Infections in Mice: A Dissertation","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) infects 50-100 million people worldwide every year and is the causative agent of dengue fever (DF) and the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). There are four genetically and immunologically distinct DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). Evidence suggests that an increased risk for DHF/DSS during secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype is due to an immunopathological response mediated by serotype-cross-reactive memory T cells from the primary infection. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have shown that the sequence of infection with different DENV serotypes affects disease severity. Though much has been learned from human studies, there exist uncontrollable variables that are intrinsic in this system such as genetic factors and unknown infection histories. These factors can skew experimental results, making interpretations difficult. Therefore, a murine model to study the immunologic aspects of sequential dengue infections would be an asset to the field of dengue research. To examine the effect of sequential infection with different DENV serotypes on the CD8 + T cell response, we immunized Balb/c mice with a primary DENV infection on day 0 and subsequently challenged with a heterologous secondary DENV infection on day 28. We tested all possible sequences of infection with the four serotypes. We analyzed the T cell response to two previously defined epitopes on the DENV E (L d -restricted) and NS3 (K d -restricted) proteins. Using ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining, we measured the frequency of T cells secreting IFNγ and TNFα in response to stimulation with these epitopes during three phases: acute primary, acute secondary, and the memory phase after primary infection. We found that the T cell response in heterologous secondary infections was higher in magnitude than the response in acute primary infection or during the memory phase. We also found that the hierarchy of epitope specific responses, as measured by IFNγ secretion, was influenced by the sequence of infections. The adoptive transfer of immune serum or immune splenocytes suggested that memory T cells from the primary infection responded to antigens from the secondary infection. In vitro experiments with T cell lines generated from mice with primary and secondary DENV infections suggested the preferential expansion of crossreactive memory T cells. In testing all of the different possible sequences of infection, we observed that two different sequences of infection (e.g., DENV-2 followed by DENV-1 versus DENV-2 followed by DENV-3) resulted in differential CD8 + T cell responses to the NS3 peptide even though both secondary infection serotypes contain the identical peptide sequence.

Attempts to develop effective vaccines have been hampered by the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and the absence of suitable experimental models for dengue viral infection. The magnitude of T-cell responses has been reported to correlate with dengue disease severity. Sixty Malaysian adults with dengue viral infections were investigated for their dengue virus-specific T-cell responses to 32 peptides antigens from the structural and nonstructural regions from a dengue virus isolate. Seventeen different peptides from the C, E, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 regions were found to evoke significant responses in a gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay of samples from 13 selected patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). NS3 and predominantly NS3422-431 were found to be important T-cell targets. The highest peaks of T-cell responses observed were in responses to NS3422-431 and NS5563-571 in DHF patients.

Anti-DV envelope glycoprotein (E) 99 clones, anti-DV premembrane protein (prM) 8 clones, and anti-DV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) 4 clones were derived from four acute-phase patients, and anti-DV E 2 clones, anti-DV prM 2 clones, and anti-DV NS1 8 clones were derived from five convalescent-phase patients. Methods and results In the present study, we examined whether these clones cross-reacted with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which belongs to the same virus family. Forty-six of the above-described 99 (46/99) anti-E, 0/8 anti-prM, and 2/4 anti-NS1 HuMAbs from acute-phase, and 0/2 anti-E, 0/2 anti-prM, and 5/8 anti-NS1 HuMAbs from convalescent-phase showed neutralizing activity against JEV. Thus, most of the anti-E and anti-NS1 (but not the anti-prM) antibodies cross-reacted with JEV and neutralized this virus. Interestingly, 3/46 anti-E HuMAbs derived from acute-phase patients and 3/5 anti-NS1 HuMAbs from convalescent-phase patients showed particularly high neutralizing activity against JEV. Consequently, the HuMAbs showing neutralization against JEV mostly consisted of two populations: one was HuMAbs recognizing DV E and showing neutralization activity against all four DV serotypes (complex-type) and the other was HuMAbs recognizing DV NS1 and showing subcomplex-type cross-reaction with DV. Conclusion Anti-DV E from acute phase (46/99) and anti-DV NS1 (7/12) indicate neutralizing activity against JEV.

Antibodies recognizing EDIIFP have been shown to associate with immune enhancement in an ex vivo animal model. In this study, we explored how prime-boost strategies influence the immunogenicity of a cross-reactivity reduced (CRR) DENV-2 vaccine with substitutions in EDIIFP residues (DENV-2 RD) and found that mice in various DENV-2 RD prime-boost immunizations had significantly reduced levels of EDIIFP antibodies.

Recent experimental studies suggest that an effective vaccine against DENV should elicit a strong T cell response against all serotypes, which could be achieved by directing T cell responses toward cross-serotypically conserved epitopes while avoiding serotype-specific ones. Here, we used experimentally-determined DENV T cell epitopes and patient-derived DENV sequences to assess the cross-serotypic variability of the epitopes.

Infection with or immunization against any of these viruses induces a subset of antibodies that are broadly flavivirus cross-reactive but do not exhibit significant cross-neutralization. Nevertheless, these antibodies can efficiently bind to the major envelope protein (E), which is the main target of neutralizing and protective antibodies because of its receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. The structural basis for this phenomenon is still unclear. In our studies with TBE virus, we have provided evidence that such cross-reactive antibodies are specific for a cluster of epitopes that are partially occluded in the cage-like assembly of E proteins at the surfaces of infectious virions and involve—but are not restricted to—amino acids of the highly conserved internal fusion peptide loop. Virus disintegration leads to increased accessibility of these epitopes, allowing the cross-reactive antibodies to bind with strongly increased avidity. The cryptic properties of these sites in the context of infectious virions can thus provide an explanation for the observed lack of efficient neutralizing activity of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, despite their specificity for a functionally important structural element in the E protein.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The cryptic properties of these sites in the context of infectious virions can provide an explanation for the observed lack of efficient neutralizing activity of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, despite their specificity for a functionally important structural element in the E protein."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":234,"details":{"paperId":"7ce33b7a0f3e142733fdc7786795f9fafbcb8ef6","externalIds":{"MAG":"2079866702","DOI":"10.1006/JMBI.2000.3924","CorpusId":"23527460","PubMed":"10966782"},"title":"Crystal structure of Dengue virus NS3 protease in complex with a Bowman-Birk inhibitor: implications for flaviviral polyprotein processing and drug design.","abstract":"Dengue viruses are members of the Flaviviridae and cause dengue fever and the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever. Although nearly 40 % of the world's population is at risk of dengue infection, there is currently no effective vaccine or chemotherapy for the disease. Processing of the dengue polyprotein into structural and non-structural proteins in a host, which is essential for assembly of infective virions, is carried out by the combined action of host proteases and the trypsin-like, two-component viral NS2B/NS3 serine protease. Although NS2B strongly stimulates the catalytic NS3 protease domain, the latter is fully active against small substrates and possesses detectable activity against larger substrates, making both forms of the enzyme possible targets for drug design. In the crystal structure of a complex of the protease with a Bowman-Birk inhibitor reported here, an Arg residue at the P1 position of the inhibitor is bound in a manner distinctly different from that in other serine proteases of comparable specificity. However, because the regulatory component, NS2B, is not present in the complex, the physiological implications of this observations are currently unclear. The redundant nature of interaction of P1 Arg and Lys residues with Asp129, Tyr150 and Ser163 of the enzyme provides an explanation for the observed behavior of several site-specific mutants of Asp129 in the protease. The strong level of conservation of residues in the protease that interact with the P1 Arg, along with conservation of Arg at P1 of most cleavage sites in other flaviviruses, suggests that observations from this structure are likely to be applicable to many flaviviruses.

The flaviviruses (Flavivirus genus) are small RNA viruses transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks that take over host cell machinery in order to propagate. However, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses are not antropod-borne. Despite the extensive research and public health concern associated with flavivirus diseases, to date, there is no specific treatment available for any flavivirus infections, though commercially available vaccines for yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-born encephalitis exist.

Recent findings The dengue viruses (DENVs) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses transmitted by infected Aedes mosquitoes. Illness manifests across a clinical spectrum with severe disease characterized by intravascular volume depletion and hemorrhage. Recent estimates on the burden of DENV infection determined that there are 390 million dengue infections per year, three times the current estimate by the WHO. There are no licensed antivirals or vaccines to treat or prevent dengue though many are in preclinical or clinical development. DENV illness results from a complex interaction of viral properties and host immune responses. Immunologic complexity, lack of an adequate animal model of disease, absence of an immune correlate of protection, and only partially informative immunogenicity assays are challenging dengue vaccine development efforts.

Chemical control is achieved either by using synthetic or natural insecticides where the latter is more preferable. In biological control, bacteria, fungi and larvivorous fish are utilised to reduce the vector population. Moreover, genes of mosquitoes are also explored to produce progenies which are sterile with low survival ability. Vaccines are among the most effective ways to prevent viral infection. Various approaches have been used and are still being explored towards producing vaccines for dengue. These include live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant subunit, nucleic acid and virus-like particles vaccines. The aim is to produce a vaccine which can target all the four serotypes of the virus.

Host factors essential for viral replication are potential targets for antiviral development. Here we report that cyclophilins (CyPs), a family of cellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases), play a role in flavivirus replication. Huh-7.5 cells with knockdown of different isoforms of CyP were less efficient than parental cells in supporting flavivirus replication, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus, and yellow fever virus. The low viral replication in CyP A (CyPA) knockdown cells could be rescued by trans supplying of a wild-type CyPA but not by trans supplying of a mutant CyPA (defective in the PPIase activity), indicating that the isomerase activity of CyPA is critical for viral replication. Immunoprecipitation and biochemical pulldown analyses showed that CyPA interacts with WNV genomic RNA and viral NS5 protein in the replication complex. Furthermore, antiviral experiments demonstrated that cyclosporine (Cs; an 11-amino-acid cyclic peptide known to block the PPIase activity of CyPA) inhibits flavivirus replication in cell culture at nontoxic concentrations. Time-of-addition and transient replicon results indicated that Cs inhibits flavivirus at the step of viral RNA synthesis.

Changes of lipid-related metabolites in endoplasmic reticulum of dengue virus (DENV) infected cells have been associated with replicative complexes formation. Previously, we reported that DENV infection inhibits HMGCR phosphorylation generating a cholesterol-enriched cellular environment in order to favor viral replication. In this work, using enzymatic assays, ELISA, and WB we found a significant higher activity of HMGCR in DENV infected cells, associated with the inactivation of AMPK. AMPK activation by metformin declined the HMGCR activity suggesting that AMPK inactivation mediates the enhanced activity of HMGCR. A reduction on AMPK phosphorylation activity was observed in DENV infected cells at 12 and 24 hpi. HMGCR and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A and E, suggesting a role for HMGCR and AMPK activity in the formation of DENV replicative complexes. Furthermore, metformin and lovastatin (HMGCR inhibitor) altered this co-localization as well as replicative complexes formation supporting that active HMGCR is required for replicative complexes formation. In agreement, metformin prompted a significant dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV infected cells, while compound C (AMPK inhibitor) augmented the viral genome copies and the percentage of infected cells. The PP2A activity, the main modulating phosphatase of HMGCR, was not affected by DENV infection. These data demonstrate that the elevated activity of HMGCR observed in DENV infected cells is mediated through AMPK inhibition and not by increase in PP2A activity. Interestingly, the inhibition of this phosphatase showed an antiviral effect in an HMGCR-independent manner. These results suggest that DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation leading to higher cholesterol levels in endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation. This work provides new information about the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during DENV replicative cycle and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation leading to higher cholesterol levels in endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8228,"details":{"paperId":"ad1571ba9709aa28f8fe9f6d5e888b71b205739a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2121461868","DOI":"10.4161/hv.25673","CorpusId":"2974740","PubMed":"23880886"},"title":"DENV-2 subunit proteins fused to CR2 receptor-binding domain (P28)-induces specific and neutralizing antibodies to the Dengue virus in mice","abstract":"Domain III (DIII) of the dengue virus (DENV) envelope (E) protein induces strong neutralizing type-specific antibodies.

Present investigation established that some of the drug molecules currently used mainly in cancer treatment are susceptible to bind non-active site (allosteric site/ cavity) of the NS3 protease enzyme of dengue virus. Computational screening and molecular docking analysis found that dabrafenib, idelalisib and nintedanib can bind at the allosteric site of the enzyme. The binding of the molecules to the allosteric site found to be stabilized via pi-cation and hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen-bond formation and π-stacking interaction with the molecules. Several interacting residues of the enzyme were common in all the five serotypes. However, the interaction/stabilizing forces were not uniformly distributed; the π-stacking was dominated with DENV3 proteases, whereas, a charged/ionic interaction was the major force behind interaction with DENV2 type proteases. In the allosteric cavity of protease from DENV1, the residues Lys73, Lys74, Thr118, Glu120, Val123, Asn152 and Ala164 were involved in active interaction with the three molecules (dabrafenib, idelalisib and nintedanib). Molecular dynamics (MD) analysis further revealed that the molecules on binding to NS3 protease caused significant changes in structural fluctuation and gained enhanced stability. Most importantly, the binding of the molecules effectively perturbed the protein conformation. These changes in the protein conformation and dynamics could generate allosteric modulation and thus may attenuate/alter the NS3 protease functionality and mobility at the active site.

This study aimed to determine the role of increased TLR3- and TLR7/8-mediated innate signaling after Dengue infection of rhesus macaques in vivo to evaluate its impact on disease and anti-DENV immune responses. Methodology/Principal Findings TLR3 and TLR7/8 agonists (emulsified in Montanide) were administered subcutaneously to rhesus macaques at 48 hours and 7 days after DENV infection. The Frequency and activation of myeloid dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and B cells were measured by flow cytometry while the serum levels of 14 different cytokines and chemokines were quantified. Adaptive immune responses were measured by DENV-specific antibody subtype measurements. Results showed that the combined TLR agonists reduced viral replication and induced the development of a proinflammatory reaction, otherwise absent in Dengue infection alone, without any clear signs of exacerbated disease. Specifically, the TLR-induced response was characterized by activation changes in mDC subsets concurrent with higher serum levels of CXCL-10 and IL-1Ra. TLR stimulation also induced higher titers of anti-DENV antibodies and acted to increase the IgG2/IgG1 ratio of anti-DENV to favor the subtype associated with DENV control. We also observed an effect of DENV-mediated suppression of mDC activation consistent with prior in vitro studies. Conclusions/Significance These data show that concurrent TLR3/7/8 activation of the innate immune response after DENV infection in vivo acts to increase antiviral mechanisms via increased inflammatory and humoral responses in rhesus macaques, resulting in decreased viremia and melioration of the infection.

The current prevention and treatment of these infectious diseases are either non-satisfactory or entirely lacking. Because DENV and ZIKV have much similarities in genomic and structural features, almost identical mode of mosquito-mediated transmission, and probably the same pattern of host innate and adaptive immunity toward them, it is reasonable and often desirable to investigate these two viruses side-by-side, and thereby devise common countermeasures against both. Here, we review the existing knowledge on DENV and ZIKV regarding epidemiology, molecular virology, protective immunity and vaccine development, discuss recent new discoveries on the functions of flavivirus NS1 protein in viral pathogenesis and transmission, and propose a one-two punch strategy using vaccine and vector blockade to overcome antibody-dependent enhancement and defeat Dengue and Zika viruses.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A one-two punch strategy using vaccine and vector blockade to overcome antibody-dependent enhancement and defeat Dengue and Zika viruses is proposed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3035,"details":{"paperId":"3eb11459831a6c4570f7eab604a5c8a3111379e7","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/nm.2997","CorpusId":"367447","PubMed":"23135514"},"title":"Defeating dengue: a challenge for a vaccine","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A phase 2b trial testing a recombinant live, attenuated tetravalent dengue–yellow fever chimeric virus vaccine in Thai schoolchildren of 4–11 years of age showed an overall efficacy of 30.2%, and one or more doses of the vaccine reduced the incidence of disease caused by the DENV3 and DENV4 d Dengue virus serotypes by 80–90%, however, there was no efficacy against DENV2."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2763,"details":{"paperId":"3aa446bbde1952d69d8846a2da15e2b71acc01a3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2073115309","DOI":"10.1016/S0928-0197(98)00038-5","CorpusId":"4047732","PubMed":"9741645"},"title":"Defective adenoviruses as novel vaccines for the Flaviviridae.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3088,"details":{"paperId":"1086402cfacc378009e32f0c13b5c8829cd2776a","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8052367","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-22341-7","CorpusId":"233278358","PubMed":"33863888"},"title":"Defective viral genomes as therapeutic interfering particles against flavivirus infection in mammalian and mosquito hosts","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A combined experimental evolution and computational approach is used to identify DVG sequences that optimally interfere with Zika virus infection and show antiviral activity in mice and mosquitoes."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5348,"details":{"paperId":"165ba6863860e93328ee72c065523069fa873a32","externalIds":{"MAG":"2135882929","PubMedCentral":"4600115","DOI":"10.1128/mBio.01316-15","CorpusId":"10697751","PubMed":"26374123"},"title":"Defining New Therapeutics Using a More Immunocompetent Mouse Model of Antibody-Enhanced Dengue Virus Infection","abstract":"ABSTRACT With over 3.5 billion people at risk and approximately 390 million human infections per year, dengue virus (DENV) disease strains health care resources worldwide. Previously, we and others established models for DENV pathogenesis in mice that completely lack subunits of the receptors (Ifnar and Ifngr) for type I and type II interferon (IFN) signaling; however, the utility of these models is limited by the pleotropic effect of these cytokines on innate and adaptive immune system development and function. Here, we demonstrate that the specific deletion of Ifnar expression on subsets of murine myeloid cells (LysM Cre+ Ifnarflox/flox [denoted as Ifnarf/f herein]) resulted in enhanced DENV replication in vivo. The administration of subneutralizing amounts of cross-reactive anti-DENV monoclonal antibodies to LysM Cre+ Ifnarf/f mice prior to infection with DENV serotype 2 or 3 resulted in antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection with many of the characteristics associated with severe DENV disease in humans, including plasma leakage, hypercytokinemia, liver injury, hemoconcentration, and thrombocytopenia. Notably, the pathogenesis of severe DENV-2 or DENV-3 infection in LysM Cre+ Ifnarf/f mice was blocked by pre- or postexposure administration of a bispecific dual-affinity retargeting molecule (DART) or an optimized RIG-I receptor agonist that stimulates innate immune responses. Our findings establish a more immunocompetent animal model of ADE of infection with multiple DENV serotypes in which disease is inhibited by treatment with broad-spectrum antibody derivatives or innate immune stimulatory agents. IMPORTANCE Although dengue virus (DENV) infects hundreds of millions of people annually and results in morbidity and mortality on a global scale, there are no approved antiviral treatments or vaccines. Part of the difficulty in evaluating therapeutic candidates is the lack of small animal models that are permissive to DENV and recapitulate the clinical features of severe human disease. Using animals lacking the type I interferon receptor only on myeloid cell subsets, we developed a more immunocompetent mouse model of severe DENV infection with characteristics of the human disease, including vascular leakage, hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, and liver injury. Using this model, we demonstrate that pathogenesis by two different DENV serotypes is inhibited by therapeutic administration of a genetically modified antibody or a RIG-I receptor agonist that stimulates innate immunity.

However, in vivo, siRNAs are vulnerable to degradation by serum nucleases and rapid renal excretion due to their small size and anionic character. To enhance siRNA delivery and stability, we complexed anti-DENV siRNAs with biocompatible gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and tested them in vitro. We found that cationic AuNP-siRNA complexes could enter Vero cells and significantly reduce DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) replication and infectious virion release under both pre- and post-infection conditions.

An effective vaccine against all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) has not been developed yet. Among the different vaccination strategies available today, DNA vaccines are safe and practical, but currently induce relatively weak immune responses in humans. In order to improve immunogenicity, antigens may be targeted to dendritic cells (DCs), the main antigen presenting cells and orchestrators of the adaptive immune response, inducing T and B cell activation. It was previously shown that a DNA vaccine encoding a fusion protein comprised of an antigen and a single-chain Fv antibody (scFv) specific for the DC endocytic receptor DEC205 induced strong immune responses to the targeted antigen. In this work, we evaluate this strategy to improve the immunogenicity of dengue virus (DENV) proteins. Plasmids encoding the scFv αDEC205, or an isotype control (scFv ISO), fused to the DENV2 envelope protein domain III (EDIII) were generated, and EDIII specific immune responses were evaluated in immunized mice. BALB/c mice were intramuscularly (i.m.) immunized three times with plasmid DNAs encoding either scDEC-EDIII or scISO-EDIII followed by electroporation. Analyses of the antibody responses indicated that EDIII fusion with scFv targeting the DEC205 receptor significantly enhanced serum anti-EDIII IgG titers that inhibited DENV2 infection. Similarly, mice immunized with the scDEC-EDIII plasmid developed a robust CD4+ T cell response to the targeted antigen, allowing the identification of two linear epitopes recognized by the BALB/c haplotype. Taken together, these results indicate that targeting DENV2 EDIII protein to DCs using a DNA vaccine encoding the scFv αDEC205 improves both antibody and CD4+ T cell responses.

When individuals are infected in the virtual absence of cross-protective dengue antibodies, the dengue vascular permeability syndrome (DVPS) may ensue.

A complete understanding of the biologic mechanism of iADE, dengue biology, and the mechanism of host responses to dengue infection should lead to a comprehensive and complete understanding of the pathogenesis of DVPS.

The prevalence and incidence of dengue fever and death due to its complications have been increased drastically in these recent years in Bangladesh, Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, and India. Recently, dengue had spread in an epidemic form in Bangladesh, Thailand, and Philippines. Although the infection affected a large number of people around the world, there is no established specific and effective treatment by synthetic medicines. In this subcontinent, Malaysia could effectively control its incidences and death of patients using alternative medication treatment mainly prepared from Carica papaya L. leaves along with proper care and hospitalization. Papaya leaves, their juice or extract, as well as their different forms of preparation have long been used traditionally for treating dengue fever and its complications to save patients’ lives. Although it is recommended by traditional healers, and the general public use Papaya leaves juice or their other preparations in dengue fever, this treatment option is strictly denied by the physicians offering treatment in hospitals in Bangladesh as they do not believe in the effectiveness of papaya leaves, thus suggesting to patients that they should not use them. In Bangladesh, 1,01,354 dengue patients have been hospitalized, with 179 deaths in the year 2019 according to information from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Research as well as the Directorate General of Health Services of Bangladesh. Most of the patients died because of the falling down of platelets to dangerous levels and hemorrhage or serious bleeding. Therefore, this paper aims to critically review the scientific basis and effectiveness of Carica papaya L. leaves in treating dengue fever based on preclinical and clinical reports.

The standard neutralization assay cannot differentiate between serotype-specific and serotype cross-reactive antibodies in patients early after infection, leading to an overestimation of the long-term serotype-specific protection of an antibody response. It is known that the cross-reactive response in patients is temporary but few studies have assessed kinetics and potential changes in serum antibody specificity over time. To better define the specificity of polyclonal antibodies during disease and after recovery, longitudinal samples from patients with primary or secondary DENV-2 infection were collected over a period of 1 year.

In a previous study we demonstrated that an infectious cDNA clone-derived dengue type 4 (DEN-4) virus retains higher genetic stability in MRC-5 cells than in Vero cells. For this study we investigated two DEN-4 viruses: the infectious cDNA clone-derived DEN-4 2A and its derived 3′ NCR 30-nucleotide deletion mutant DEN-4 2AΔ30, a vaccine candidate. Mutations in the C-prM-E, NS2B-NS3, and NS4B-NS5 regions of the DEN genome were sequenced and compared following cell passages in Vero and MRC-5 cells. Our results indicate stronger genetic stability in both viruses following MRC-5 cell passages, leading to significantly lower RNA polymerase error rates when the DEN-4 virus is used for genome replication. Although no significant increases in virus titers were observed following cell passages, DEN-4 2A and DEN-4 2AΔ30 virus titers following Vero cell passages were 17-fold to 25-fold higher than titers following MRC-5 cell passages. Neurovirulence for DEN-4 2A and DEN-4 2AΔ30 viruses increased significantly following passages in Vero cells compared to passages in MRC-5 cells. In addition, more severe DEN-induced hemorrhaging in mice was noted following DEN-4 2A and DEN-4 2AΔ30 passages in Vero cells compared to passages in MRC-5 cells. Target mutagenesis performed on the DEN-4 2A infectious clone indicated that single point mutation of E-Q438H, E-V463L, NS2B-Q78H, and NS2B-A113T imperatively increased mouse hemorrhaging severity. The relationship between amino acid mutations acquired during Vero cell passage and enhanced DEN-induced hemorrhages in mice may be important for understanding DHF pathogenesis, as well as for the development of live-attenuated dengue vaccines.

The same cloned DENV-4 was found to yield a single E-Glu327Gly (E-E327G) mutation after passage in FRhL cells and cause the loss of immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys.

Recombinant E-DIII proteins of E345K and E327G increased heparin binding correlated with the reduced infectivity by heparin treatment in cell cultures. Different from the E-E327G mutant viruses to lose the immunogencity in rhesus monkeys, the E-E345K mutant viruses were able to induce neutralizing antibodies in rhesus monkeys with an almost a 10-fold lower level of viremia as compared to the wild type virus. Monkeys immunized with the E-E345K mutant virus were completely protected with no detectable viremia after live virus challenges with the wild type DENV-4.

Dengue is caused by four closely related viruses (DENV-1–4), and a person can be infected with each serotype for a total of four infections during their lifetime. Areas where dengue is endemic in the United States and its territories and freely associated states include Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. This report summarizes the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use of the Dengvaxia vaccine in the United States. The vaccine is a live-attenuated, chimeric tetravalent dengue vaccine built on a yellow fever 17D backbone. Dengvaxia is safe and effective in reducing dengue-related hospitalizations and severe dengue among persons who have had dengue infection in the past. Previous natural infection is important because Dengvaxia is associated with an increased risk for severe dengue in those who experience their first natural infection (i.e., primary infection) after vaccination. Dengvaxia was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use among children and adolescents aged 9–16 years (referred to in this report as children). ACIP recommends vaccination with Dengvaxia for children aged 9–16 having evidence of a previous dengue infection and living in areas where dengue is endemic.

The disease is induced by dengue virus infection resulting from the bite of an infected Aedes spp. mosquito after imbibing the tainted blood from animals or patients. Dynamic clinical spectrums ranging from asymptomatic, undifferentiated fever, typical dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) have been well documented. Initially, the disease was mainly restricted in tropical and subtropical zones. However, with factors such as ineffective vector control, frequency of human migration, unplanned urbanization, and changing climate temperature, the disease has been spotted at almost every territory of the earth. Dengue has been associated with human disease for more than two centuries. Although classic DF is viewed as a self-limited illness, subjects normally resolve within two weeks and recover without any noticeable complications or sequelae, some of these infected individuals may progress to life-threatening DHF/DSS, characterized with plasma leakage due to an increase in capillary permeability. The significantly increased public health threat and the burden of morbidity and mortality of dengue globally has caught the attention of public officials and prompted an action to find a way to contain and prevent the disease. The lack of specific dengue therapeutics has led to an emphasis on vaccine development, one of the best and effective strategies to reduce and prevent the illness. Making a dengue vaccine has been attempted more than six decades; although some of these products are in clinical trials, vaccine development for the prevention of dengue disease is still at its infancy. So far no dengue vaccine is available for the public. Dengue vaccine development may be hindered by the complexity of the clinical presentations, which implicates that multiple pathogenic mechanisms are involved in dengue disease. Some of these elements will be discussed in the current review. Opening up discussion on these pros and cons and engaging in more research to understand these features would not only improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the dengue virus infection but also pave a new tactic to develop a safer and effective dengue vaccine.","publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Dengue vaccine development may be hindered by the complexity of the clinical presentations, which implicates that multiple pathogenic mechanisms are involved in dengue disease, and opening up discussion on these pros and cons and engaging in more research to understand these features would not only improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the d Dengue virus infection but also pave a new tactic to develop a safer and effective denge vaccine."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6626,"details":{"paperId":"986b662931fe4913f92303b6c6730930a3ec6905","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3789748","MAG":"2001200141","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003551","CorpusId":"16876058","PubMed":"24098108"},"title":"Dengue Vaccines: Strongly Sought but Not a Reality Just Yet","abstract":"Dengue virus (DV) infections cause undisputedly the mostimportant arthropod-borne viral disease in terms of worldwideprevalence, human suffering, and cost.

Cross-protection to other serotypes lasting for a few months is observed following infection with one serotype. There is evidence that low-affinity T and/or B cells from primary infections contribute to the severe syndromes often associated with secondary dengue infections. such pronounced immune-mediated enhancement suggests a dengue-specific pattern of immune cell activation. This study investigates the acute and early convalescent B cell response leading to the generation of cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies following dengue infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We assayed blood samples taken from dengue patients with primary or secondary infection during acute disease and convalescence and compared them to samples from patients presenting with non-dengue related fever. Dengue induced massive early plasmablast formation, which correlated with the appearance of polyclonal, cross-reactive IgG for both primary and secondary infection. Surprisingly, the contribution of IgG to the neutralizing titer 4–7 days after fever onset was more than 50% even after primary infection. Conclusions/Significance Poly-reactive and virus serotype cross-reactive IgG are an important component of the innate response in humans during both primary and secondary dengue infection, and “innate specificities” seem to constitute part of the adaptive response in dengue.

Antibodies to flaviviruses can be protective, resulting in lifelong immunity to reinfection by homologous virus. However, cross-reactive antibodies can complicate flavivirus diagnostics and promote more severe disease, as noted after serial dengue virus (DENV) infections. The endemic circulation of DENV in South America and elsewhere raises concerns that preexisting flavivirus immunity may modulate ZIKV disease and transmission potential. Here, we report on the ability of human monoclonal antibodies and immune sera derived from dengue patients to neutralize contemporary epidemic ZIKV strains. We demonstrate that a class of human monoclonal antibodies isolated from DENV patients neutralizes ZIKV in cell culture and is protective in a lethal murine model. We also tested a large panel of convalescent-phase immune sera from humans exposed to primary and repeat DENV infection. Although ZIKV is most closely related to DENV compared to other human-pathogenic flaviviruses, most DENV immune sera (73%) failed to neutralize ZIKV, while others had low (50% effective concentration [EC50], <1:100 serum dilution; 18%) or moderate to high (EC50, >1:100 serum dilution; 9%) levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies. Our results establish that ZIKV and DENV share epitopes that are targeted by neutralizing, protective human antibodies. The availability of potently neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies provides an immunotherapeutic approach to control life-threatening ZIKV infection and also points to the possibility of repurposing DENV vaccines to induce cross-protective immunity to ZIKV. IMPORTANCE ZIKV is an emerging arbovirus that has been associated with severe neurological birth defects and fetal loss in pregnant women and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic for ZIKV. The identification of a class of antibodies (envelope dimer epitope 1 [EDE1]) that potently neutralizes ZIKV in addition to all four DENV serotypes points to a potential immunotherapeutic to combat ZIKV. This is especially salient given the precedent of antibody therapy to treat pregnant women infected with other viruses associated with microcephaly, such as cytomegalovirus and rubella virus. Furthermore, the identification of a functionally conserved epitope between ZIKV and DENV raises the possibility that a vaccine may be able to elicit neutralizing antibodies against both viruses.

UV-4B is an iminosugar that inhibits the α-glucosidase family of enzymes and subsequently the folding of glycosylated proteins, both viral and host. Here, we utilized next-generation sequencing to investigate evolution of a flavivirus under selective pressure by a host-targeted antiviral in vivo. In viral populations recovered from UV-4B-treated mice, there was a significant increase in the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs compared to findings in viral populations from vehicle-treated mice. The strongest evidence of positive selection was in the glycosylated membrane protein, thereby providing in vivo validation of the mechanism of action of an iminosugar. In addition, mutations in glycosylated proteins were present only in drug-treated mice after a single passage. However, the bulk of the other mutations were present in both populations, indicating nonspecific selective pressure. Together with the continued control of viremia by UV-4B, these findings are consistent with the previously predicted high genetic barrier to escape mutations in host-targeted antivirals. IMPORTANCE Although hundreds of millions of people are infected with DENV every year, there is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy. UV-4B has demonstrated antiviral activity against DENV and is expected to enter clinical trials soon. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of DENV resistance to UV-4B. Host-targeted antivirals are thought to have a higher genetic barrier to escape mutants than directly acting antivirals, yet there are very few published studies of viral evolution under host-targeted antivirals. No study to date has described flavivirus evolution in vivo under selective pressure by a host-based antiviral drug. We present the first in vivo study of the sequential progression of viral evolution under selective pressure by a host-targeted antiviral compound. This study bolsters support for the clinical development of UV-4B as an antiviral drug against DENV, and it provides a framework to compare how treatment with other host-targeted antiflaviviral drugs in humans and different animal models influence viral genetic diversity.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study bolsters support for the clinical development of UV-4B as an antiviral drug against DENV, and provides a framework to compare how treatment with other host-targeted antiflaviviral drugs in humans and different animal models influence viral genetic diversity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6353,"details":{"paperId":"57c83b780dbb4d5941f60c93c0ed934263ad7d05","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"2749937","MAG":"2102514367","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0007251","CorpusId":"2922115","PubMed":"19802382"},"title":"Dengue Virus Infection and Virus-Specific HLA-A2 Restricted Immune Responses in Humanized NOD-scid IL2rγnull Mice","abstract":"Background The lack of a suitable animal model to study viral and immunological mechanisms of human dengue disease has been a deterrent to dengue research.

It is well established that during ADE, DENV-antibody immune complexes (ICs) infect Fcγ receptor-bearing cells and increase the systemic viral burden that can be measured in the blood. For protection against infection with DENV serotypes 1 to 4, strongly neutralizing Abs must be elicited to overcome the effect of ADE. Clinical observations in infants who have maternal DENV Abs or recent phase II/III clinical trials with a leading tetravalent dengue vaccine suggested a lack of correlation between Ab neutralization and in vivo disease prevention. In addressing this gap in knowledge, we found that inoculation of ICs formed with serotype cross-reactive Abs that are more than 98% neutralized in vitro promotes high mortality in AG129 mice even though peak viremia was lower than that in direct virus infection. This suggests that the serum viremia level is not always correlated with disease severity. We further demonstrated that infection with the ICs resulted in increased vascular permeability, specifically in the small intestine, accompanied with increased tissue viral load and cytokine production, which can be suppressed by anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) Abs. Flow cytometric analysis identified increased infection in CD11bint CD11cint/hi CD103− antigen-presenting cells by IC inoculation, suggesting that these infected cells may be responsible for the increase in TNF-α production and vascular permeability in the small intestine that lead to mortality in mice. Our findings may have important implications for the development of dengue therapeutics. IMPORTANCE We examined the relationship between the neutralizing level of Abs at the time of infection and subsequent disease progression in a mouse model in order to understand why patients who are shown to have a neutralizing quantity of Abs still allow sufficient DENV replication to induce severe dengue manifestations, which sometimes do not correlate with viremia level. Strikingly, we found that high mortality was induced in AG129 mice by the increase in TNF-α-induced vascular permeability accompanied by an increased viral load, specifically in the small intestine, even when the initial infection level is suppressed to less than 5% and the peak viremia level is not enhanced. This suggests that ADE overcomes the protective efficacy of Abs in a tissue-dependent manner that leads to severe small intestinal pathology. Our findings may serve to address the pathogenic role of Abs on severe dengue disease and also help to develop safe Ab-based therapeutic strategies.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that high mortality was induced in AG129 mice by the increase in TNF-α-induced vascular permeability accompanied by an increased viral load, specifically in the small intestine, even when the initial infection level is suppressed to less than 5% and the peak viremia level is not enhanced."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6122,"details":{"paperId":"b7b687f7d61fc9a8e65e4e52a1df0f8419f93be3","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3289619","MAG":"2172170367","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0001536","CorpusId":"2319018","PubMed":"22389741"},"title":"Dengue Virus Infection-Enhancing Activity in Serum Samples with Neutralizing Activity as Determined by Using FcγR-Expressing Cells","abstract":"Background Progress in dengue vaccine development has been hampered by limited understanding of protective immunity against dengue virus infection.

Maturation of DENV particles requires proper cleavage of the viral polyprotein, including processing of 8 of the 13 substrate cleavage sites by dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease. With no available direct-acting antiviral targeting DENV, NS2/NS3 protease is a promising target for inhibitor design. Current design efforts focus on the nonprime side of the DENV protease active site, resulting in highly hydrophilic and nonspecific scaffolds. However, the prime side also significantly modulates DENV protease binding affinity, as revealed by engineering the binding loop of aprotinin, a small protein with high affinity for DENV protease. In this study, we designed a series of cyclic peptides interacting with both sides of the active site as inhibitors of dengue virus protease. The design was based on two aprotinin loops and aimed to leverage both key specific interactions of substrate sequences and the entropic advantage driving aprotinin's high affinity. By optimizing the cyclization linker, length, and amino acid sequence, the tightest cyclic peptide achieved a Ki value of 2.9 μM against DENV3 wild-type (WT) protease. These inhibitors provide proof of concept that both sides of DENV protease active site can be exploited to potentially achieve specificity and lower hydrophilicity in the design of inhibitors targeting DENV. IMPORTANCE Viruses of the flaviviral family, including DENV and Zika virus transmitted by Aedes aegypti, continue to be a threat to global health by causing major outbreaks in tropical and subtropical regions, with no available direct-acting antivirals for treatment. A better understanding of the molecular requirements for the design of potent and specific inhibitors against flaviviral proteins will contribute to the development of targeted therapies for infections by these viruses.

Recently, it has been suggested that the antibody levels needed for DENV neutralization differs when different FcγR is engaged. If this is true, the threshold titer used to infer immunity should be influenced by FcγR usage. Here, using cells that express both activating and inhibitory FcγRs, we show that the type of FcγR engaged during phagocytosis can influence the antibody concentration requirement for DENV neutralization. We demonstrate that phagocytosis through FcγRI requires significantly less antibody for complete DENV neutralization compared to FcγRIIA. Furthermore, when DENV is opsonized with sub-neutralizing levels of antibody, FcγRI-mediated phagocytosis resulted in significantly reduced DENV titers compared to FcγRIIA. However, while FcγRI may remove antibody-opsonized DENV more efficiently, this receptor is only preferentially engaged by clustering when neutralizing, but not sub-neutralizing antibody concentrations, were used.

Abnormal activation of the coagulation and fibrinolysis system is one of the hallmarks of DHF/DSS. However, the mechanism underlying hemorrhage in DHF/DSS remains elusive. In previous studies, plasminogen (Plg) cross-reactive Abs, which can recognize DENV nonstructural protein (NS) 1, have been found in dengue patients. However, it is unclear whether these Abs are indeed induced by DENV NS1. Thus, we immunized mice with recombinant NS1 from both bacteria and drosophila to determine whether NS1 can induce Plg cross-reactive Abs. The results from the NS1-immunized mouse sera indicated that NS1 immunization induced Abs that could cross-react with Plg. To study the effects of these NS1-induced Plg cross-reactive Abs on fibrinolysis, we isolated several Plg cross-reactive anti-NS1 mAbs from these mice and found that some of them could enhance Plg activation. In addition, epitope mapping with a phage-displayed random peptide library revealed that one of these mAbs (2A5) could recognize NS1 C-terminal residues 305–311, which share sequence homology with Plg residues 590–597. A synthetic peptide of NS1 residues 305–311 could inhibit the binding of both 2A5 and its Fab to Plg and its enhanced activation.

The overall procedures were easy and of economic advantage. It is to be stated in this connection that the affinity of dengue viruses to tissue culture cells is not necessarily high, so that the cell culture systems suitable for dengue virus plaquing have so far been limited; and even in such suitable systems the formation of clear plaques takes a much longer time of incubation than for other kinds of arbo-viruses in general.

We show that MHC class I expression is upregulated in the dengue virus replicon-expressing cells and that the binding of natural killer (NK) inhibitory receptors to these cells is augmented. This upregulation results in reduced susceptibility of the dengue virus replicon-expressing cells to NK lysis, indicating a possible mechanism for evasion of the dengue virus from NK cell recognition. Visualizing MHC class I expression in replicon-containing K562 and THP-1 cells by confocal microscopy demonstrated aggregation of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. Finally, replicon-expressing K562 cells manifested increased TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) and LMP (low-molecular-mass protein) gene transcription, while replicon-expressing THP-1 cells manifested increased NF-κB activity and MHC class I transcription. We suggest that expression of dengue virus nonstructural proteins is sufficient to induce MHC class I upregulation through both TAP-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Because sequential infection by different DENV serotypes is associated with more severe disease, eliciting a protective neutralizing antibody response against all four serotypes is a major goal of vaccine efforts. ABSTRACT Dengue virus cocirculates globally as four serotypes (DENV1 to −4) that vary up to 40% at the amino acid level. Viral strains within a serotype further cluster into multiple genotypes. Eliciting a protective tetravalent neutralizing antibody response is a major goal of vaccine design, and efforts to characterize epitopes targeted by polyclonal mixtures of antibodies are ongoing. Previously, we identified two E protein residues (126 and 157) that defined the serotype-specific antibody response to DENV1 genotype 4 strain West Pac-74. DENV1 and DENV2 human vaccine sera neutralized DENV1 viruses incorporating these substitutions equivalently. In this study, we explored the contribution of these residues to the neutralization of DENV1 strains representing distinct genotypes. While neutralization of the genotype 1 strain TVP2130 was similarly impacted by mutation at E residues 126 and 157, mutation of these residues in the genotype 2 strain 16007 did not markedly change neutralization sensitivity, indicating the existence of additional DENV1 type-specific antibody targets. The accessibility of antibody epitopes can be strongly influenced by the conformational dynamics of virions and modified allosterically by amino acid variation. We found that changes at E domain II residue 204, shown previously to impact access to a poorly accessible E domain III epitope, impacted sensitivity of DENV1 16007 to neutralization by vaccine immune sera. Our data identify a role for minor sequence variation in changes to the antigenic structure that impacts antibody recognition by polyclonal immune sera. Understanding how the many structures sampled by flaviviruses influence antibody recognition will inform the design and evaluation of DENV immunogens.

Because sequential infection by different DENV serotypes is associated with more severe disease, eliciting a protective neutralizing antibody response against all four serotypes is a major goal of vaccine efforts.

The disease is systemic and dynamic with broad range of manifestations, varying from mild symptoms to severe dengue (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome). The only licensed tetravalent dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, is a chimeric yellow fever virus with prM and E genes from the different dengue serotypes. However, recent results indicated that seronegative individuals became more susceptible to develop severe dengue when infected after vaccination, and now WHO recommends vaccination only to dengue seropositive people. One possibility to explain these data is the lack of robust T-cell responses and antibody-dependent enhancement of virus replication in vaccinated people. On the other hand, DNA vaccines are excellent inducers of T-cell responses in experimental animals and it can also elicit antibody production. Clinical trials with DNA vaccines have improved and shown promising results regarding the use of this approach for human vaccination. Therefore, in this paper we review preclinical and clinical tests with DNA vaccines against the dengue virus. Most of the studies are based on the E protein since this antigen is the main target for neutralizing antibody production. Yet, there are other reports with DNA vaccines based on non-structural dengue proteins with protective results, as well. Combining structural and non-structural genes may be a solution for inducing immune responses aging in different infection moments. Furthermore, DNA immunizations are also a very good approach in combining strategies for vaccines against dengue, in heterologous prime/boost regimen or even administering different vaccines at the same time, in order to induce efficient humoral and cellular immune responses.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Preclinical and clinical tests with DNA vaccines against the dengue virus based on the E protein are reviewed, finding that combining structural and non-structural genes may be a solution for inducing immune responses aging in different infection moments."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5034,"details":{"paperId":"7570c4212e9e20335d39392a3f70af704618881a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2287622965","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.01805-15","CorpusId":"3881652","PubMed":"26512092"},"title":"Dengue Virus prM-Specific Human Monoclonal Antibodies with Virus Replication-Enhancing Properties Recognize a Single Immunodominant Antigenic Site","abstract":"ABSTRACT The proposed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism for severe dengue virus (DENV) disease suggests that non-neutralizing serotype cross-reactive antibodies generated during a primary infection facilitate entry into Fc receptor bearing cells during secondary infection, resulting in enhanced viral replication and severe disease. One group of cross-reactive antibodies that contributes considerably to this serum profile target the premembrane (prM) protein. We report here the isolation of a large panel of naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) obtained from subjects following primary DENV serotype 1, 2, or 3 or secondary natural DENV infections or following primary DENV serotype 1 live attenuated virus vaccination to determine the antigenic landscape on the prM protein that is recognized by human antibodies. We isolated 25 prM-reactive human MAbs, encoded by diverse antibody-variable genes. Competition-binding studies revealed that all of the antibodies bound to a single major antigenic site on prM. Alanine scanning-based shotgun mutagenesis epitope mapping studies revealed diverse patterns of fine specificity of various clones, suggesting that different antibodies use varied binding poses to recognize several overlapping epitopes within the immunodominant site. Several of the antibodies interacted with epitopes on both prM and E protein residues. Despite the diverse genetic origins of the antibodies and differences in the fine specificity of their epitopes, each of these prM-reactive antibodies was capable of enhancing the DENV infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells. IMPORTANCE Antibodies may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of enhanced DENV infection and disease during secondary infections. A substantial proportion of enhancing antibodies generated in response to natural dengue infection are directed toward the prM protein. The fine specificity of human prM antibodies is not understood. Here, we isolated a panel of dengue prM-specific human monoclonal antibodies from individuals after infection in order to define the mode of molecular recognition by enhancing antibodies. We found that only a single antibody molecule can be bound to each prM protein at any given time. Distinct overlapping epitopes were mapped, but all of the epitopes lie within a single major antigenic site, suggesting that this antigenic domain forms an immunodominant region of the protein. Neutralization and antibody-dependent enhanced replication experiments showed that recognition of any of the epitopes within the major antigenic site on prM was sufficient to cause enhanced infection of target cells.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that only a single antibody molecule can be bound to each prM protein at any given time, and all of the epitopes lie within a single major antigenic site, suggesting that this antigenic domain forms an immunodominant region of the protein."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8098,"details":{"paperId":"aaaa062129ae5c78251bfba1c0a503e358d956b7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2098136541","DOI":"10.4049/jimmunol.1102218","CorpusId":"39322665","PubMed":"22079981"},"title":"Dengue Virus-Induced Autoantibodies Bind to Plasminogen and Enhance Its Activation","abstract":"Dengue virus infection can lead to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in patients. Abnormal activation of the coagulation and fibrinolysis system is one of the hallmarks associated with DHF/DSS patients. However, the mechanisms that cause pathology in DHF/DSS patients are still unclear. Because conversion of plasminogen (Plg) to plasmin (Plm) is the first step in the activation of fibrinolysis, Abs against Plg found in DHF/DSS patients may be important. Therefore, to investigate the specificity, function, and possible origin of these Abs, we generated several Plg cross-reactive mAbs from DENV-immunized mice. An IgG mAb, 6H11, which recognizes an epitope associated with a dengue envelope protein, demonstrated a high level of cross-reactivity with Plg. The 6H11 Ab was further characterized with regard to its effect on Plg activation. Using Plm-specific chromogenic substrate S-2251, we found that mAb 6H11 demonstrated serine protease activity and could convert Plg directly to Plm. The serine protease activity of mAb 6H11 was further confirmed using serine protease chromogenic substrate S-2288. In addition, we found several Plg cross-reactive mAbs that could enhance urokinase-induced Plg activation. Lastly, mAb 6H11 could induce Plm activity and increase the level of D-dimer (a fibrin degradation product) in both human and mouse platelet-poor plasma.

DENV exist as four serotypes, DENV1-DENV4. Following a primary infection, individuals produce DENV-specific antibodies that bind only to the serotype of infection and other antibodies that cross-react with two or more serotypes. People exposed to a secondary DENV infection with another serotype are at greater risk of developing more severe forms of dengue disease. The increased risk of severe dengue in people experiencing repeat DENV infections appear to be due, at least in part, to the ability of pre-existing serotype cross-reactive antibodies to form virus-antibody complexes that can productively infect Fcγ receptor-bearing target cells. While the theory of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is supported by several human and small animal model studies, the specific viral antigens and epitopes recognized by enhancing human antibodies after natural infections have not been fully defined. We used antibody-depletion techniques to remove DENV-specific antibody sub-populations from primary DENV-immune human sera. The effects of removing specific antibody populations on ADE were tested both in vitro using K562 cells and in vivo using the AG129 mouse model. Removal of serotype cross-reactive antibodies ablated enhancement of heterotypic virus infection in vitro and antibody-enhanced mortality in vivo. Further depletion studies using recombinant viral antigens showed that although the removal of DENV E-specific antibodies using recombinant E (rE) protein resulted in a partial reduction in DENV enhancement, there was a significant residual enhancement remaining. Competition ADE studies using prM-specific Fab fragments in human immune sera showed that both rE-specific and prM-specific antibodies in primary DENV-immune sera significantly contribute to enhancement of heterotypic DENV infection in vitro.

For recombinant DIII vaccine development, prime-boost immunizations can provide an advantage of eliciting more type-specific neutralizing antibodies by recalling DIII antigens after DIII booster to improve protection. Methods: The DIII of the E genes of DENV and ZIKV were fused with bacterial fliC gene for the expression of flagellin-DIII (FliC-DIII) fusion proteins. Prime-boost immunization strategies by the second-dose booster of four DENV serotype or ZIKV FliC-DIII fusion proteins were used to investigate the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection against viral infections.

DF is an acute flavivi us infection transmitted by several species of Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue virus has 4 antigenically related serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. Infection with any 1 of the 4 serotypes can produce a broad spectrum of effects, including asymptomatic infection, mild febrile illness, classic DF, and the lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Dengue virus has become impossible to eradicate and difficul to control, because of massive urbanization, overpopulation,ever-increasing regional and international travel, and failure to sustain Aedes aegypti control programs. Moreover, there is no specifi treatment for DHF/DSS. Mortality rates vary from !1% to 130%, depending on diagnostic acumen and availability of intravenous fluid and blood for treatment of the hypovolemic shock caused by massive hemorrhage and capillary plasma leak [2]. An estimated 50–100 million dengue infections and 500,000 DHF/DSS cases occur annually in the tropics, and DF is well known in North American and European travelers and military personnel [3]. In tropical areas where dengue virus is highly endemic, DHF/DSS is typically confine to children younger than age 15 years, with a mean age of 5–10 years. Dengue infection has spread progressively to most tropical countries during the past 40 years, particularly to countries in Southeast Asia, the western Pacific and Latin America [1]. To illustrate, the number of cases of DF and DHF/DSS in the Philippines has increased 700% between the 1970s and the early 1990s. In Indonesia, dengue infection was recognized in only 2 cities in 1968; by 2001, it was reported in all of the nation’s provinces and in 93% of its 310 districts. DHF is the second-most-frequent cause of pediatric admissions at Jakarta’s largest public hospital, after acute respiratory infections. The spread of dengue virus from cities to rural areas has impeded the diagnosis and management of DHF/DSS; this, in turn, has resulted in higher case fatality rates, which may be as high as 30% in rural areas, compared with 1% in cities. The disease now occurs throughout most months of the year and is no longer confine to the 4–6-month rainy season. Prominent media attention and the fact that DHF/DSS affects poor and rich children alike have contributed to its notoriety. Dengue epidemics cause the population to panic and to overwhelm hospitals and outpatient clinics. There is near-universal agreement among policy makers in Southeast Asian countries that a dengue vaccine is urgently needed [4]. This sense of urgency is shared by the US military and the World Health Organization [5]. A key fact driving dengue vaccine development is that a primary infection with 1 serotype may induce long-term protective immunity to reinfection with the homologous serotype but only short-term immunity, lasting several months, to heterologous serotypes [6]. Dengue differs from other hemorrhagic infections in that dengue infection is more severe in individuals who have acquired dengue antibodies either passively, from their mothers before birth, or actively, from a previous dengue infection [7–9]. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has provided an explanatory hypothesis, whereby preexisting, cross-reactive dengue virus antibodies facilitate dengue virus entry into Fc-receptor–bearing cells (e.g., macrophages), thereby increasing virus burden and disease severity [10–12]. The secondary-infection hypothesis and ADE suggest that dengue vaccines must induce protective neutralizing antibodies to all 4 serotypes simultaneously rather than sequentially, to avoid enhancement of dengue illness after subsequent infection. Also, a tetravalent vaccine will better protect travelers and troops rapidly deployed to tropical areas where several dengue virus serotypes cocirculate.

Dengue disease varies from mild fever to severe conditions of dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Globalization, increased air travel, and unplanned urbanization have led to increase in the rate of infection and helped dengue to expand its geographic and demographic distribution. Dengue vaccine development has been a challenging task due to the existence of four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes, each capable of eliciting crossreactive and disease-enhancing antibody response against the remaining three serotypes. Recently, Sanofi Pasteur’s chimeric live-attenuated dengue vaccine candidate has been approved in Mexico, Brazil, and Philippines for usage in adults between 9 and 45 years of age. The impact of its limited application to the public health system needs to be evaluated. Simultaneously, the restricted application of this vaccine candidate warrants continued efforts in developing a dengue vaccine candidate which is additionally efficacious for infants and native individuals.

Recent crystal structures of WNV (West Nile virus) protease in complex with inhibitors revealed that cNS2B participates in the formation of the protease active site. No crystal structures of ternary complexes are currently available for DENV (dengue virus) to validate the role of cNS2B in active site formation. In the present study, a GST (glutathione transferase) fusion protein of DENV-2 cNS2B49-95 was used as a bait to pull down DENV-2 protease domain (NS3pro). The affinity of NS3pro for cNS2B was strong (equilibrium-binding constant <200 nM) and the heterodimeric complex displayed a catalytic efficiency similar to that of single-chain DENV-2 cNS2B/NS3pro. Various truncations and mutations in the cNS2B sequence showed that conformational integrity of the entire 47 amino acids is critical for protease activity. Furthermore, DENV-2 NS3 protease can be pulled down and transactivated by cNS2B cofactors from DENV-1, -3, -4 and WNV, suggesting that mechanisms for activation are conserved across the flavivirus genus. To validate NS2B as a potential target in allosteric inhibitor development, a cNS2B-specific human monoclonal antibody (3F10) was utilized. 3F10 disrupted the interaction between cNS2B and NS3 in vitro and reduced DENV viral replication in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells.

We characterized DENV1 directly from early acute primary dengue samples and from their cell culture isolates. We observed that virions in humans are more infectious and mature as compared with their cell culture isolates. DENV1 cell culture isolates were hypersensitive to neutralization by human antibodies. Cross-reactive fusion loop antibodies and heterotypic immune sera poorly neutralized plasma DENV1. Identical genome sequences showed that the phenotypic differences are due to the differences in maturation state. The observed structural variation is a significant advance applicable to understanding vaccine failure and designing future vaccine strategies. The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes are mosquito-borne flaviviruses of humans. The interactions between DENVs and the human host that lead to asymptomatic, mild, or severe disease are poorly understood, in part, because laboratory models are poor surrogates for human DENV disease. Virologists are interested in how the properties of DENVs replicating in people compare with virions propagated on laboratory cell lines, which are widely used for research and vaccine development. Using clinical samples from a DENV type 1 epidemic in Sri Lanka and new ultrasensitive assays, we compared the properties of DENVs in human plasma and after one passage on laboratory cell lines. DENVs in plasma were 50- to 700-fold more infectious than cell culture-grown viruses. DENVs produced by laboratory cell lines were structurally immature and hypersensitive to neutralization by human antibodies compared with DENVs circulating in people. Human plasma and cell culture-derived virions had identical genome sequences, indicating that these phenotypic differences were due to the mature state of plasma virions. Several dengue vaccines are under development. Recent studies indicate that vaccine-induced antibodies that neutralized DENVs in cell culture assays were not sufficient for protecting people from DENV infections.

With the recent approval for human use of Sanofi-Pasteur's chimeric dengue vaccine CYD-TDV and several vaccine candidates in clinical development, the scenario of infants born to vaccinated mothers has become a reality. This raises 2 questions: will declining levels of maternal vaccine-induced antibodies cause ADE; and, will maternal antibodies interfere with vaccination efficacy in the infant? To address these questions, the above scenario was modeled in mice. Type I IFN-deficient female mice were immunized with live attenuated DENV2 PDK53, the core component of the tetravalent DENVax candidate currently under clinical development. Pups born to PDK53-immunized dams acquired maternal antibodies that strongly neutralized parental strain 16681, but not the heterologous DENV2 strain D2Y98P-PP1, and instead caused ADE during primary infection with this strain. Furthermore, pups failed to seroconvert after PDK53 vaccination, owing to maternal antibody interference. However, a cross-protective multifunctional CD8+ T cell response did develop.

This review discusses the challenges of vaccine development, current vaccine strategies and the prospects for the availability of a vaccine for travelers in the future. Cost–effectiveness studies will need to take into account many factors, including the attack rate of dengue in travelers, the proportion of travelers who will need hospitalization, the cost of altered travel itineraries, the cost of the vaccine, duration of travel, destination and season. To be licensed as a travelers’ vaccine, vaccine trials must address safety, immunogenicity, duration of protection, schedules and boosters in adults (in particular in immunologically naive adults), trials that may differ from those conducted in endemic countries.

Enhancing antibodies are one of the key regulating molecules. These antibodies, via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, are able to facilitate dengue virus (DENV) growth in Fc-bearing host cells. The mechanism of ADE-enhanced DENV production is believed to be mediated through increasing the infected-cell mass. In the present work, the effect of ADE infection was explored further, focusing on the post-entry events of ADE infection. It was hypothesized that the higher virus production in ADE infection compared with DENV infection may be due to the ability of this infection pathway to suppress key antiviral molecules. Therefore, the influence of ADE infection on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL-12), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and IL-10, was investigated and it was found that DENV infection via the Fc receptor-mediated pathway was able to suppress the transcription and translation of IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In contrast, infection via this route facilitated expression and synthesis of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the ADE infection pathway also suppresses an innate anti-DENV mediator, nitric oxide radicals, by disrupting the transcription of the iNOS gene transcription factor, IRF-1, and blocking the activation of STAT-1.

A leak in the dike Everyone knows how mosquitos can wreck an end-of-summer picnic. But in some climates, these pesky intruders persist and carry a variety of detrimental diseases—some with no preventative vaccines or targeted therapies. One such passenger is dengue virus (DENV), which infects up to 400 million people each year and comes in several serotypes (1 to 4) and disease presentations—from mild infection to severe disease and sometimes death. But to treat or prevent dengue requires that we have a more complete picture of the disease pathology. Now, Modhiran et al. and Beatty et al. describe the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments that point to circulating dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and the innate immune Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a focus for basic scientists as well as vaccine and drug developers. DENV infection protects a patient from future reinfection with the same DENV serotype as well as producing temporary immune protection from severe dengue disease caused by a different DENV serotype. But unlike diamonds, this immune protection doesn’t last forever, and when the protected period passes, the patient becomes at increased risk of enhanced infection and progression to severe disease if he or she is infected with a second DENV serotype. This severe form of dengue infection is believed to result from immunopathogenic processes that induce cytokine storm and cause vascular leakage that leads to shock. Until now, no dengue viral proteins have been linked to vascular endothelium permeability (that is, vascular leakage). Beatty et al. show that inoculation of mice with DENV NS1 protein alone induces both vascular leak and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and that administration of NS1 with a sublethal dose of DENV2 leads to lethal vascular leak syndrome. In human endothelial cell monolayers in culture, NS1 from any of the four DENV serotypes triggered endothelial barrier permeability. NS1’s pathogenic effects were blocked by NS1-immune polyclonal mouse serum or monoclonal antibodies to NS1 (in vivo and in vitro), and immunization of mice with NS1 protected against lethal DENV2 challenge. In an independent study, Mondrian et al. explore the underlying of NS1’s effects. They show that highly purified NS1 acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that activates mouse macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in culture via TLR4, resulting in release of inflammatory cytokines—an effect that was blocked by either a TLR4 antagonist or an anti-TLR4 antibody. Then, in an in vitro model of vascular leak, the authors found that NS1 fractured the integrity of endothelial cell monolayers through a TLR4-dependent pathway, a finding that was supported by the observation that a TLR4 antagonist quelled capillary leak in a mouse model of dengue virus infection. Together, these new findings highlight NS1 as an instigator of dengue-associated vascular leak and thus pinpoint a potential target for dengue drugs and component for dengue vaccines. The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause up to ~100 million cases of dengue annually worldwide. Severe disease is thought to result from immunopathogenic processes involving serotype cross-reactive antibodies and T cells that together induce vasoactive cytokines, causing vascular leakage that leads to shock. However, no viral proteins have been directly implicated in triggering endothelial permeability, which results in vascular leakage. DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted and circulates in patients’ blood during acute infection; high levels of NS1 are associated with severe disease. We show that inoculation of mice with DENV NS1 alone induces both vascular leakage and production of key inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, simultaneous administration of NS1 with a sublethal dose of DENV2 results in a lethal vascular leak syndrome. We also demonstrate that NS1 from DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 triggers endothelial barrier dysfunction, causing increased permeability of human endothelial cell monolayers in vitro. These pathogenic effects of physiologically relevant amounts of NS1 in vivo and in vitro were blocked by NS1-immune polyclonal mouse serum or monoclonal antibodies to NS1, and immunization of mice with NS1 from DENV1 to DENV4 protected against lethal DENV2 challenge. These findings add an important and previously overlooked component to the causes of dengue vascular leak, identify a new potential target for dengue therapeutics, and support inclusion of NS1 in dengue vaccines.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments point to circulating dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and the innate immune Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a focus for basic scientists as well as vaccine and drug developers."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7468,"details":{"paperId":"cdd1dbd5902c6895fc8cd65dab1ea11d9382d515","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9398000","DOI":"10.3389/fcimb.2022.959727","CorpusId":"251409574","PubMed":"36017362"},"title":"Dengue virus NS4B protein as a target for developing antivirals","abstract":"Dengue virus is an important pathogen affecting global population while no specific treatment is available against this virus.

There are a number of different vaccines undergoing testing, but whilst a dengue vaccine is clearly desirable, there are several issues which make live-attenuated vaccines problematic. These include the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and the possibility of recombination of attenuated vaccine strains with wild-type flavivirus members reverting vaccines to a virulent form.

Primary infections are typically associated with a largely serotype-specific antibody response, while secondary infections show a shift to a broadly cross-reactive antibody response. Methods/Principal findings We hypothesized that the basis for the shift in serotype-specificity between primary and secondary infections can be found in a change in the antibody fine-specificity. To investigate the link between epitope- and serotype-specificity, we assembled the Dengue Virus Antibody Database, an online repository containing over 400 DENV-specific mAbs, each annotated with information on 1) its origin, including the immunogen, host immune history, and selection methods, 2) binding/neutralization data against all four DENV serotypes, and 3) epitope mapping at the domain or residue level to the DENV E protein. We combined epitope mapping and activity information to determine a residue-level index of epitope propensity and cross-reactivity and generated detailed composite epitope maps of primary and secondary antibody responses. We found differing patterns of epitope-specificity between primary and secondary infections, where secondary responses target a distinct subset of epitopes found in the primary response. We found that secondary infections were marked with an enhanced response to cross-reactive epitopes, such as the fusion-loop and E-dimer region, as well as increased cross-reactivity in what are typically more serotype-specific epitope regions, such as the domain I-II interface and domain III. Conclusions/Significance Our results support the theory that pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells form the basis for the secondary antibody response, resulting in a broadening of the response in terms of cross-reactivity, and a focusing of the response to a subset of epitopes, including some, such as the fusion-loop region, that are implicated in poor neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results support the theory that pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells form the basis for the secondary antibody response, resulting in a broadening of the response in terms ofCross-reactivity, and a focusing of theresponse to a subset of epitopes, including some that are implicated in poor neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement of infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5854,"details":{"paperId":"0dbb441a1f5c4acd7d4b0d421cbb01e0dd05e282","externalIds":{"MAG":"2781529006","PubMedCentral":"5753465","DBLP":"journals/bmcsb/ShahenGSETZWBFZ18","DOI":"10.1186/s12918-017-0518-x","CorpusId":"3352877","PubMed":"29301573"},"title":"Dengue virus causes changes of MicroRNA-genes regulatory network revealing potential targets for antiviral drugs","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Preliminary support is shown to suggest that the herbal medicine RDN combined with LRD can reduce both susceptibility and the severity of DENV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3263,"details":{"paperId":"9c2b98b09ca25a3e0cf766fc6164de77c403885f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2571743075","PubMedCentral":"5234037","DOI":"10.1038/srep40923","CorpusId":"370187","PubMed":"28084461"},"title":"Dengue virus compartmentalization during antibody-enhanced infection","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that co-ligation of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) by antibody-opsonized DENV also signals through SHP-1 to attenuate the otherwise rapid acidification for lysosomal enzyme activation following FcγR-mediated uptake of DENV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4229,"details":{"paperId":"ea0e46e1ab10c8719c070e5da13fae048185577d","externalIds":{"MAG":"2167275396","DOI":"10.1099/vir.0.055178-0","CorpusId":"20247867","PubMed":"23851440"},"title":"Dengue virus envelope domain III immunization elicits predominantly cross-reactive, poorly neutralizing antibodies localized to the AB loop: implications for dengue vaccine design.","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes severe health problems. An effective tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate that can provide life-long protection simultaneously against all four DENV serotypes is highly anticipated. A better understanding of the antibody response to DENV envelope protein domain III (EDIII) may offer insights into vaccine development. Here, we identified 25 DENV cross-reactive mAbs from immunization with Pichia pastoris-expressed EDIII of a single or all four serotype(s) using a prime-boost protocol, and through pepscan analysis found that 60 % of them (15/25) specifically recognized the same highly conserved linear epitope aa 309-320 of EDIII.

However, neutralization assays indicated that the majority of these 15 mAbs were either moderately or weakly neutralizing. Through further epitope mapping by yeast surface display, two residues in the AB loop, Q316 and H317, were discovered to be critical. Three-dimensional modelling analysis suggests that this epitope is surface exposed on EDIII but less accessible on the surface of the E protein dimer and trimer, especially on the surface of the mature virion. It is concluded that EDIII as an immunogen may elicit cross-reactive mAbs toward an epitope that is not exposed on the virion surface, therefore contributing inefficiently to the mAbs neutralization potency.

The best means to control this global health threat is a vaccine, but dengue vaccine development has progressed slowly, partly because the antigenic targets required to stimulate long-term immunity are not well-defined. Here, we show a specific region on the viral surface (the envelope domain I/II hinge) that is the target of protective antibodies after primary human infections. These results are critically important for dengue vaccine design, because we hypothesize that a successful dengue vaccine will stimulate antibodies that target this region. More broadly, this study establishes a template for similar approaches for improving vaccines for influenza, HIV, hepatitis C virus, and other clinically important viral pathogens. The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4, are endemic throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with an estimated 390 million acute infections annually. Infection confers long-term protective immunity against the infecting serotype, but secondary infection with a different serotype carries a greater risk of potentially fatal severe dengue disease, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The single most effective measure to control this threat to global health is a tetravalent DENV vaccine. To date, attempts to develop a protective vaccine have progressed slowly, partly because the targets of type-specific human neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which are critical for long-term protection, remain poorly defined, impeding our understanding of natural immunity and hindering effective vaccine development. Here, we show that the envelope glycoprotein domain I/II hinge of DENV-3 and DENV-4 is the primary target of the long-term type-specific NAb response in humans. Transplantation of a DENV-4 hinge into a recombinant DENV-3 virus showed that the hinge determines the serotype-specific neutralizing potency of primary human and nonhuman primate DENV immune sera and that the hinge region both induces NAbs and is targeted by protective NAbs in rhesus macaques.

Despite advances in medical sciences, dengue virus (DENV) infects approximately 200 million people every year. To date, no effective antiviral is valiable to treat DENV in individuals despite great efforts in accomplishing these goals. Numerous approaches have been used in the search for dengue antiviral like screening of combinatorial compounds against DENV enzymes and structure-based computational discovery. In recent years, investigators have turned their focus into medicinal plants, trying to identify compounds that can be used as dengue antiviral. Nature represents a great reservoir of potential substances that can be explored with the aim of discovering new drugs that can be either used directly as pharmaceuticals or can provide drug leads, which can be scrutinized further for the development of new anti-dengue natural product. Many previous investigations have dealt with numerous plant extracts or bioactive principles for their antiviral property as they normally considered being safer when compared to synthetic drugs. Andrographis paniculata belongs to family Acanthaceae and is generally known as ‘king of bitters’. Diverse bioactive compounds from this plant such as diterpenes, flavonoids, xanthones, noriridoides and other miscellaneous compounds have exhibited their potential as therapeutics for various chronic as well as infectious diseases. This review is based on literature review on scientific journals, books and electronic sources, which highlights the pathogenesis of DENV and describe an assortment of bioactive principles that have been possessing antiviral potential, which include dengue and discuss the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of action of Andrographis paniculata.

virus specific IgY provides protection following lethal dengue virus challenge and is neutralizing in the absence of inducing antibody dependent enhancement","abstract":"Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are severe disease manifestations that can occur following sequential infection with different dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4). At present, there are no licensed therapies to treat DENV-induced disease. DHF and DSS are thought to be mediated by serotype cross-reactive antibodies that facilitate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) by binding to viral antigens and then Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on target myeloid cells. Using genetically engineered DENV-specific antibodies, it has been shown that the interaction between the Fc portion of serotype cross-reactive antibodies and FcγR is required to induce ADE. Additionally, it was demonstrated that these antibodies were as neutralizing as their non-modified variants, were incapable of inducing ADE, and were therapeutic following a lethal, antibody-enhanced infection. Therefore, we hypothesized that avian IgY, which do not interact with mammalian FcγR, would provide a novel therapy for DENV-induced disease. We demonstrate here that goose-derived anti-DENV2 IgY neutralized DENV2 and did not induce ADE in vitro. Anti-DENV2 IgY was also protective in vivo when administered 24 hours following a lethal DENV2 infection. We were also able to demonstrate via epitope mapping that both full-length and alternatively spliced anti-DENV2 IgY recognized different epitopes, including epitopes that have not been previously identified.

Therefore, effective vaccines that induce a broad, multi-functional T cell response with substantial cross-reactivity between all virus serotypes can have major impacts on reducing infection rates and infection related complications. Here, we took an immunoproteomic approach to identify novel MHC class I restricted T cell epitopes presented by dengue virus infected cells, representing the natural and authentic targets of the T cell response. Using this approach we identified 4 novel MHC-I restricted epitopes: 2 with the binding motif for HLA-A24 molecules and 2 with both HLA-A2 and HLA-A24 binding motifs. These peptides were able to activate CD8+ T cell responses in both healthy, seronegative individuals and in seropositive individuals who have previously been infected with dengue virus. Importantly, the dual binding epitopes activated pre-existing T cell precursors in PBMCs obtained from both HLA-A2+ and HLA-A24+ seropositive individuals.

It has been speculated, therefore, that dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are caused by serotype crossreactive immunopathological mechanisms. We analyzed clones of dengue serotype crossreactive T lymphocytes derived from the PBMC of a donor who had been infected with dengue 3 virus. These PBMC responded best to dengue 3 antigen, but also responded to dengue 1, 2, and 4 antigens, in bulk culture proliferation assays. 12 dengue antigen-specific clones were established using a limiting dilution technique. All of the clones had CD3+ CD4+ CD8 phenotypes. Eight clones responded to dengue 1, 2, 3, and 4 antigens and are crossreactive, while four other clones responded predominantly to dengue 3 antigen. These results indicate that the serotype crossreactive dengue-specific T lymphocyte proliferation observed in bulk cultures reflects the crossreactive responses detected at the clonal level. Serotype crossreactive clones produced high titers of IFN- gamma after stimulation with dengue 3 antigens, and also produced IFN- gamma to lower levels after stimulation with dengue 1, 2, and 4 antigens. The crossreactive clones lysed autologous lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) pulsed with dengue antigens, and the crossreactivity of CTL lysis by T cell clones was consistent with the crossreactivity observed in proliferation assays. Epidemiological studies have shown that secondary infections with dengue 2 virus cause DHF/DSS at a higher rate than the other serotypes. We hypothesized that the lysis of dengue virus-infected cells by CTL may lead to DHF/DSS; therefore, the clones were examined for cytotoxic activity against dengue 2 virus-infected LCL. All but one of the serotype crossreactive clones lysed dengue 2 virus-infected autologous LCL, and they did not lyse uninfected autologous LCL. The lysis of dengue antigen-pulsed or virus-infected LCL by the crossreactive CTL clones that we have examined is restricted by HLA DP or DQ antigens. These results indicate that primary dengue virus infections induce predominantly crossreactive memory CD4+ T lymphocytes.

D2V infection occurred in PBL prepared from anti-coagulated but not from defibrinated plasma. Infection enhancement was produced by multiple lots of heterotypic anti-dengue raised in several mammalian species. Homotypic anti-dengue neutralized D2V at high concentrations but enhanced at low concentrations; enhancement end point in one serum was 1:320,000. The infection-enhancing factor was a noncytophilic antibody of the IgG class. D2V infection occurred in the absence of heat-labile complement components but did not occur when complexes were prepared with anti- dengue F(ab)(2). Treatment of PBL with several proteases increased permissiveness to D2V infection by immune complexes but not by virus alone. Two rhesus monkey serums collected 14 days after D2V infection contained an IgG antibody with high-titered enhancing activity but with no hemagglutination-inhibition or neutralizing activity.

DEN2mutF virus had selected mutations in genomic sequences predicted to form a 3′ stem-loop structure (3′-SL) that is conserved among all flavivirus species. The 3′-SL constitutes the downstream terminal ∼95 nucleotides of the 3′ noncoding region in flavivirus RNA. Here we report the introduction of these same mutational changes into the analogous region of an infectious DNA derived from the genome of a human-virulent dengue serotype 1 virus (DEN1), strain Western Pacific (DEN1WP). The resulting DEN1 mutant (DEN1mutF) exhibited a host range-restricted phenotype similar to that of DEN2mutF virus. DEN1mutF virus was attenuated in a monkey model for dengue infection in which viremia is taken as a correlate of human virulence. In spite of the markedly reduced levels of viremia that it induced in monkeys compared to DEN1WP, DEN1mutF was highly immunogenic. In addition, DEN1mutF-immunized monkeys retained high levels of neutralizing antibodies in serum and were protected from challenge with high doses of the DEN1WP parent for as long as 17 months after the single immunizing dose. Phenotypic revertants of DEN1mutF and DEN2mutF were each detected after a total of 24 days in C6/36 cell cultures. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis of DEN1mutF RNA and that of a revertant virus, DEN1mutFRev, revealed that (i) the DEN1mutF genome contained no additional mutations upstream from the 3′-SL compared to the DEN1WP parent genome and (ii) the DEN1mutFRev genome contained de novo mutations, consistent with our previous hypothesis that the defect in DEN2mutF replication in C6/36 cells was at the level of RNA replication.

It had led to the emergence of dengue fever (flu-like illness), dengue shock syndrome, and the most severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (severe dengue with bleeding abnormalities). As Dengue hemorrhage diseases are the life-threatening ones, attempts are being made worldwide to design inhibitors for DENV-2 NS2B-NS3 protease. NS2B/NS3 protease plays a vital role in the replication of dengue virus. The trypsin-like serine protease domain of NS3 contains the functional catalytic triad His-51, Asp-75, and Ser-135 in the N-terminal region. Inhibition of the NS3 protease activity is expected to prevent the propagation of dengue virus. Current drug discovery methods are largely inefficient and thus relatively ineffective in tackling the growing threat to public health presented by emerging and remerging viral pathogens. Recently, there has been a need of interest in peptides and their mimetics as potential antagonists for dengue protease because these small peptides are unlikely to invoke an immune response since they fall below the immunogenic threshold. They are often potent and display fewer toxicity issues than small-molecule compounds as a result of high specificity. This study was conducted to design peptides as enzyme inhibitors of dengue virus NS3 protease through computational approach. Crystallographic structure of dengue protease was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDBID: 2FOM) and docked with the peptides and the results are analyzed.

To this effect, several computational approaches were applied in this work. Initially molecular docking studies of reference ligands to the DEN2 NS2B/NS3 serine protease were carried out. These reference ligands consist of reported competitive inhibitors extracted from Boesenbergia rotunda (i.e., 4-hydroxypanduratin A and panduratin A) and three other synthesized panduratin A derivative compounds (i.e., 246DA, 2446DA and 20H46DA). The design of new lead inhibitors was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the enzyme complexed to the reference ligands was minimized and their complexation energies (i.e., sum of interaction energy and binding energy) were computed. New compounds as potential dengue inhibitors were then designed by putting various substituents successively on the benzyl ring A of the reference molecule. These substituted benzyl compounds were then computed for their enzyme-ligand complexation energies. New enzyme-ligand complexes, exhibiting the lowest complexation energies and closest to the computed energy for the reference compounds, were then chosen for the next stage manipulation and design, which involved substituting positions 4 and 5 of the benzyl ring A (positions 3 and 4 for 2446DA) with various substituents.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Several computational approaches were applied in this work to efficiently and cost-effectively identify antiviral drug leads for development into potent drugs to combat the dengue virus infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2898,"details":{"paperId":"8536ff93627d4289b3a3c97b33d9ed6fd09b4ab2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2968482999","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00698","CorpusId":"199548907","PubMed":"31403780"},"title":"Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Substituted 4,6-Dihydrospiro[[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-7,3'-indoline]-2',5(3H)-dione Analogues as Potent NS4B Inhibitors for the Treatment of Dengue Virus Infection.","abstract":"A series of substituted 4,6-dihydrospiro[[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-7,3'-indoline]-2',5(3H)-dione analogues were synthesized and evaluated as potent dengue virus inhibitors.

Most of the antibodies generated during dengue infection are non-neutralizing and cause antibody dependent enhancement. Hence, making a potent neutralizing antibody against all four dengue serotypes could be very effective for the treatment. However, designing a single antibody for all serotypes is difficult due to variation in protein sequences. Therefore, the objective is to identify conserved region of dengue envelope protein and then develop an antibody against that conserved region. Before advancing to the development of such an antibody, it is desirable to validate the interactions between antibody and dengue envelope protein. In silico analysis of such interactions provides a good platform to find out a suitable region to design and construct an antibody against it by analyzing antigen-antibody interaction before synthesizing the antibody. In this study, two highly conserved regions of dengue envelope protein were identified and an scFv was constructed against it. Both scFv and FuBc proteins were expressed in bacterial expression system and binding efficiency was analyzed by SPR analysis with KD value 2.3 μM. In order to improve binding efficiency, an in silico scFv mutant library was created which was virtually screened for higher binding efficiency.

While mammalian cell-produced mAbs have shown promise as therapeutic candidates against several flaviviruses, their eventual approval for human application still faces several challenges including their potential risk of predisposing treated patients to more severe secondary infection by a heterologous flavivirus through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The high cost associated with mAb production in mammalian cell cultures also poses a challenge for the feasible application of these drugs to the developing world where the majority of flavivirus infection occurs.

Here, we describe efforts to engineer epitope-based vaccines against DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1). NS1 is present in DENV-infected cells as well as secreted into the blood of infected individuals. NS1 causes disruption of endothelial cell barriers, resulting in plasma leakage and hemorrhage. Immunizing against NS1 could elicit antibodies that block NS1 function and also target NS1-infected cells for antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. We identified highly conserved regions of NS1 from all four DENV serotypes. We generated synthetic peptides to these regions and chemically conjugated them to bacteriophage Qβ virus-like particles (VLPs).

Today, there are around 100 million reported clinical cases each year. Co-circulation of multiple serotypes of the dengue virus causes a variety of manifestations ranging from mild symptoms, via debilitating morbidity, to a severe form that, although relatively rare, has a high mortality rate. As current dengue control programs are severely strained, an efficacious vaccine to prevent infection is an urgent global public health priority. However, production of a dengue vaccine is compromised by an incomplete understanding of compounding factors including the existence of five now known serotypes, duration of protection provided by vaccination, dosing regimen and period, cost of production, and determination of the immune status of vaccine recipients. All these issues need to be considered in successful vaccine design.

A therapeutic antibody against the viral envelope (E) protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control. Methodology/Principal Findings We generated seventeen novel mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high reactivity against E protein of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). The mAbs were further dissected using recombinant E protein domain I-II (E-DI-II) and III (E-DIII) of DENV-2. Using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and mouse protection assay with lethal doses of DENV-2, we identified four serotype-specific mAbs that had high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection. Of the four, E-DIII targeting mAb DB32-6 was the strongest neutralizing mAb against diverse DENV-2 strains. Using phage display and virus-like particles (VLPs) we found that residue K310 in the E-DIII A-strand was key to mAb DB32-6 binding E-DIII. We successfully converted DB32-6 to a humanized version that retained potency for the neutralization of DENV-2 and did not enhance the viral infection. The DB32-6 showed therapeutic efficacy against mortality induced by different strains of DENV-2 in two mouse models even in post-exposure trials.

The number of cases of severe disease associated with DEN virus infection is growing because of the continued spread of the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, which transmits the virus to humans. Infection with DEN virus can result in an asymptomatic infection, a febrile illness called dengue fever (DF), and the very severe disease called dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Currently, a licensed vaccine is not available. However, a tetravalent vaccine is urgently needed to prevent DF and DHF/DSS, the latter of which occurs predominantly in partially immune individuals. A live attenuated, tetravalent DEN virus vaccine candidate has been generated using reverse genetics that is able to provide immunity to each of the four serotypes of DEN. Attenuation has been achieved by generating recombinant DEN (rDEN) viruses which are modified by deletion or, alternatively, by antigenic chimerization between two related DEN viruses using the following two strategies: 1) introduction of an attenuating 30 nucleotide deletion (Delta30) mutation into the 3' untranslated region of DEN1 and DEN4; and 2) replacement of structural proteins of the attenuated rDEN4Delta30 vaccine candidate with those from DEN2 or DEN3.

Since JE is primarily an inapparent infection in humans, ~40 million infections result in far fewer cases of JE, ^30,000 cases annually. In the meeting in Austria, Meegan (WHO, Geneva) reported that WHO monitors dengue through regional offices in New Delhi, Manila, and the Pan American Health Organization and supports vaccine development in established laboratories by providing funds for an additional salary or supplies or both. Halstead (USA) pointed out that the global distribution of dengue coincided with the global distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, that there were tens of millions of cases annually, and that over the past 25 years there were ~2 million cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever resulting in 35,000 deaths. He summarized the information associating severe disease with prior infection to another serotype of dengue: Cross-reactive but nonneutralizing antibodies from a previous dengue infection bind to the newly infecting dengue virus, and the infectious complex then enters susceptible cells via Fc receptors. In infants, the waning of maternal protective antibodies by 6-9 months leaves infants susceptible to hemorrhagic fever because of the greater quantities and hence longer lasting maternal cross-reactive enhancing antibodies. For these reasons, dengue vaccines must induce specific protective antibodies to all four serotypes of dengue virus.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The strategic plan for dengue and Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus vaccine development described in that report is essentially on schedule and the importance of the program is underscored by the occurrence of up to 40 million cases of d Dengue annually."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8760,"details":{"paperId":"47fe449043bb8f459574902e3bb683f52bcd5fb7","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.9771/cmbio.v21i1.44965","CorpusId":"248621379"},"title":"Development of monoclonal antibodies against prM of Dengue virus 4","abstract":"Introduction: dengue is a most common mosquito-borne viral disease in the Americas and tropical countries.

The virus stock was submitted to concentration and ultracentrifugation and stored at -80 C until use (VC DENV 4). Balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50μg of DENV-4 and successive intraperitoneal injections of 25 μg of VC DENV 4 with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant were performed. The spleen cells were fused to SP2/0 myeloma cells with PEG 1540 and distributed in 96-well microplates with Iscove’s modified medium with Hipoxantina–Aminopterina–Timidina. Hybridoma screening by indirect ELISA showed positive results for six mAbs, and their characterization was performed by Western blotting and Indirect Immunofluorescence (IFI) techniques.

Severe disease is frequently observed in the setting of secondary infection with heterologous dengue virus serotypes, suggesting a role for cross-reactive memory T cells in the immunopathogenesis of severe disease. We used a large panel of well-characterized dengue virus-specific CD8+ T-cell clones isolated from Pacific Islanders previously infected with dengue virus 1 to examine effector memory function, focusing on a novel dominant HLA-B*5502-restricted NS5329-337 epitope, and assessed T-cell responses to stimulation with variant peptides representing heterologous serotypes. Variant peptides were differentially recognized by dengue virus 1-specific effector CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in a heterogeneous and clone-specific manner, in which cytolytic function and cytokine secretion could be enhanced, diminished, or abrogated compared with cognate peptide stimulation. Dengue virus-specific CTL stimulated with cognate and variant peptides demonstrated a cytokine response hierarchy of gamma IFN (IFN-γ) > tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) > interleukin-2 (IL-2), and a subset of clones also produced IL-4 and IL-6. Individual clones demonstrated greater avidity for variant peptides representing heterologous serotypes, including serotypes previously encountered by the subject, and IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion was enhanced by stimulation with these heterologous peptides.

The role of viral genotypic diversity and factors that could have influenced this phenomenon were investigated. The serum neutralisation sensitivity of DEN3/II strains responsible for the DENV-3 outbreak cycles in 1992–1995 and 2002 were examined. Representative virus isolates from the respective outbreaks were subjected to virus neutralisation assay using identified sera of patients with homotypic (DENV-3) or heterotypic dengue infections (DENV-1 and DENV-2). Results from the study suggested that isolates representing DENV-3/II group E (DENV-3/II-E) from the 1992–1995 outbreak and DENV-3/II group F (DENV-3/II-F) from the 2002 outbreak were neutralised at similar capacity (intergenotypic differences <2-fold) by sera of patients infected with DENV-3, DENV-1 and DENV-2/Asian genotypes. Sera of the DENV-2/Cosmopolitan infection efficiently neutralised DENV-3/II-F (FRNT50 = 508.0) at a similar neutralisation capacity against its own homotypic serotype, DENV-2 (FRNT50 = 452.5), but not against DENV-3/II-E (FRNT50 = 100.8).

This study shows that the authentic presentation of DENV2 E-based subunits has a strong impact on antibody responses, underscoring the importance of mimicking the complex protein structures that are found on DENV particle surfaces when designing subunit vaccines. ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is responsible for the most prevalent and significant arthropod-borne viral infection of humans. The leading DENV vaccines are based on tetravalent live-attenuated virus platforms. In practice, it has been challenging to induce balanced and effective responses to each of the four DENV serotypes because of differences in the replication efficiency and immunogenicity of individual vaccine components. Unlike live vaccines, tetravalent DENV envelope (E) protein subunit vaccines are likely to stimulate balanced immune responses, because immunogenicity is replication independent. However, E protein subunit vaccines have historically performed poorly, in part because the antigens utilized were mainly monomers that did not display quaternary-structure epitopes found on E dimers and higher-order structures that form the viral envelope. In this study, we compared the immunogenicity of DENV2 E homodimers and DENV2 E monomers. The stabilized DENV2 homodimers, but not monomers, were efficiently recognized by virus-specific and flavivirus cross-reactive potently neutralizing antibodies that have been mapped to quaternary-structure epitopes displayed on the viral surface. In mice, the dimers stimulated 3-fold-higher levels of virus-specific neutralizing IgG that recognized epitopes different from those recognized by lower-level neutralizing antibodies induced by monomers. The dimer induced a stronger E domain I (EDI)- and EDII-targeted response, while the monomer antigens stimulated an EDIII epitope response and induced fusion loop epitope antibodies that are known to facilitate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This study shows that DENV E subunit antigens that have been designed to mimic the structural organization of the viral surface are better vaccine antigens than E protein monomers.

Our results showed, for the first time, that activation of AMPK using the specific small molecule activator PF-06409577 reduced WNV, ZIKV, and DENV infection. This antiviral effect was associated with an impairment of viral replication due to the modulation of host cell lipid metabolism exerted by the compound.

Four serotypes of dengue virus, DENV1 to DENV4, coexist. Secondary infection by a different serotype is a risk factor for severe dengue. Monoclonal antibody mAb4E11 neutralizes the four serotypes of DENV with varying efficacies by recognizing an epitope located within domain‐III (ED3) of the viral envelope (E) protein. To better understand the cross‐reactivities between mAb4E11 and the four serotypes of DENV, we constructed mutations in both Fab4E11 fragment and ED3, and we searched for indirect interactions in the crystal structures of the four complexes. According to the serotype, 7 to 12 interactions are mediated by one water molecule, 1 to 10 by two water molecules, and several of these interactions are conserved between serotypes. Most interfacial water molecules make hydrogen bonds with both antibody and antigen. Some residues or atomic groups are engaged in both direct and water‐mediated interactions. The doubly‐indirect interactions are more numerous in the complex of lowest affinity. The third complementarity determining region of the light chain (L‐CDR3) of mAb4E11 does not contact ED3. The structures and double‐mutant thermodynamic cycles showed that the effects of (hyper)‐mutations in L‐CDR3 on affinity were caused by conformational changes and indirect interactions with ED3 through other CDRs. Exchanges of residues between ED3 serotypes showed that their effects on affinity were context dependent. Thus, conformational changes, structural context, and indirect interactions should be included when studying cross‐reactivity between antibodies and different serotypes of viral antigens for a better design of diagnostics, vaccine, and therapeutic tools against DENV and other Flaviviruses.

No clinically approved vaccine or antiviral is currently available for DENV. Here we report a spiropyrazolopyridone compound that potently inhibits DENV both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitor was identified through screening of a 1.8-million-compound library by using a DENV-2 replicon assay. The compound selectively inhibits DENV-2 and -3 (50% effective concentration [EC50], 10 to 80 nM) but not DENV-1 and -4 (EC50, >20 μM). Resistance analysis showed that a mutation at amino acid 63 of DENV-2 NS4B (a nonenzymatic transmembrane protein and a component of the viral replication complex) could confer resistance to compound inhibition. Genetic studies demonstrate that variations at amino acid 63 of viral NS4B are responsible for the selective inhibition of DENV-2 and -3. Medicinal chemistry improved the physicochemical properties of the initial “hit” (compound 1), leading to compound 14a, which has good in vivo pharmacokinetics. Treatment of DENV-2-infected AG129 mice with compound 14a suppressed viremia, even when the treatment started after viral infection. The results have proven the concept that inhibitors of NS4B could potentially be developed for clinical treatment of DENV infection. Compound 14a represents a potential preclinical candidate for treatment of DENV-2- and -3-infected patients. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) threatens up to 2.5 billion people and is now spreading in many regions in the world where it was not previously endemic. While there are several promising vaccine candidates in clinical trials, approved vaccines or antivirals are not yet available.

While an ever-increasing number of insect-specific flaviviruses have been described, we have a narrow understanding of flavivirus incidence and evolution. To expand this understanding, we discovered a number of novel flaviviruses that infect a range of crustaceans and cephalopod hosts. Phylogenetic analyses of these novel marine flaviviruses suggest that crustacean flaviviruses share a close ancestor to all terrestrial vector-borne flaviviruses, and squid flaviviruses are the most divergent of all known flaviviruses to date. Additionally, our results indicate horizontal transmission of a marine flavivirus between crabs and sharks. Taken together, these data suggest that flaviviruses move horizontally between invertebrates and vertebrates in ocean ecosystems. This study demonstrates that flavivirus invertebrate-vertebrate host associations have arisen in flaviviruses at least twice and may potentially provide insights into the emergence or origin of terrestrial vector-borne flaviviruses. ABSTRACT Most described flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) are disease-causing pathogens of vertebrates maintained in zoonotic cycles between mosquitoes or ticks and vertebrate hosts. Poor sampling of flaviviruses outside vector-borne flaviviruses such as Zika virus and dengue virus has presented a narrow understanding of flavivirus diversity and evolution. In this study, we discovered three crustacean flaviviruses (Gammarus chevreuxi flavivirus, Gammarus pulex flavivirus, and Crangon crangon flavivirus) and two cephalopod flaviviruses (Southern Pygmy squid flavivirus and Firefly squid flavivirus). Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods demonstrate that crustacean flaviviruses form a well-supported clade and share a more closely related ancestor with terrestrial vector-borne flaviviruses than with classical insect-specific flaviviruses. In addition, we identify variants of Wenzhou shark flavivirus in multiple gazami crab (Portunus trituberculatus) populations, with active replication supported by evidence of an active RNA interference response. This suggests that Wenzhou shark flavivirus moves horizontally between sharks and gazami crabs in ocean ecosystems. Analyses of the mono- and dinucleotide composition of marine flaviviruses compared to that of flaviviruses with known host status suggest that some marine flaviviruses share a nucleotide bias similar to that of vector-borne flaviviruses. Furthermore, we identify crustacean flavivirus endogenous viral elements that are closely related to elements of terrestrial vector-borne flaviviruses. Taken together, these data provide evidence of flaviviruses circulating between marine vertebrates and invertebrates, expand our understanding of flavivirus host range, and offer potential insights into the evolution and emergence of terrestrial vector-borne flaviviruses.

Around half of the world’s population, especially in the tropics and subtropics, is at risk of infection. Every year, 50–100 million clinical cases are reported, and more than 500,000 patients develop the symptoms of severe dengue infection: dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which threaten life in Asia and Latin America. No antiviral drug for dengue is available. The dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5), which possesses the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity and is responsible for viral replication and transcription, is an attractive target for anti-dengue drug development. In the present study, 16,240 small-molecule compounds in a fragment library were screened for their capabilities to inhibit the DENV type 2 (DENV2) RdRp activities in vitro. Based on in cellulo antiviral and cytotoxity assays, we selected the compound RK-0404678 with the EC50 value of 6.0 μM for DENV2. Crystallographic analyses revealed two unique binding sites for RK-0404678 within the RdRp, which are conserved in flavivirus NS5 proteins. No resistant viruses emerged after nine rounds of serial passage of DENV2 in the presence of RK-0404678, suggesting the high genetic barrier of this compound to the emergence of a resistant virus.

As there are four serotypes of DENV (DENV1-4), people can be infected multiple times, each time with a new serotype. Primary infections stimulate antibodies that mainly neutralize the serotype of infection (type-specific), whereas secondary infections stimulate responses that cross-neutralize 2 or more serotypes. Previous studies have demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies induced by primary infections recognize tertiary and quaternary structure epitopes on the viral envelope (E) protein that are unique to each serotype. The goal of the current study was to determine the properties of neutralizing antibodies induced after secondary infection with a different (heterotypic) DENV serotypes. We evaluated whether polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses after secondary infections consist of distinct populations of type-specific antibodies to each serotype encountered or a new population of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies. We observed two types of responses: in some individuals exposed to secondary infections, DENV neutralization was dominated by cross-reactive antibodies, whereas in other individuals both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies contributed to neutralization. To better understand the origins of type-specific and cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies, we analyzed sera from individuals with well-documented sequential infections with two DENV serotypes only. These individuals had both type-specific and cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to the 2 serotypes responsible for infection and only cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to other serotypes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the quality of neutralizing (and presumably protective) antibodies are different in individuals depending on the number of previous exposures to different DENV serotypes.

The absence of immune correlates of protection from dengue virus (DENV) infection hampers the development of other potential DENV vaccines. While tetravalent live-attenuated tetravalent vaccines (LATVs), which mimic natural infection by inducing both cellular and humoral immune responses, are still currently favored, developing a vaccine that provides a balanced immunity to all four DENV serotypes remains a challenge. With the recently advanced understanding of virion structure and B cell immune responses from naturally infected DENV patients, two points of view in developing a next-generation dengue vaccine emerged: one is to induce potent, type-specific neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) recognizing quaternary structure-dependent epitopes by having four components of vaccine strains replicate equivalently; the other is to induce protective and broadly NtAbs against the four serotypes of DENV with a universal vaccine.

Memory CD8+CTL responses were analyzed to determine the diversity of the T cell response to dengue virus and to identify immunodominant proteins using PBMC from eight healthy adult volunteers who had received monovalent, live-attenuated candidate vaccines of the four dengue serotypes. All the donors had specific T cell proliferation to dengue and to other flaviviruses that we tested.

The nonstructural (NS3 and NS1.2a) and envelope (E) proteins were recognized by CD8+CTLs from six, five, and three donors, respectively. All donors recognized either NS3 or NS1.2a. In one donor who received a dengue 4 vaccine, CTL killing was seen in bulk culture against the premembrane protein (prM). This is the first demonstration of a CTL response against the prM protein.

More intense R&D coupled to setting up product development partnerships to facilitate the efficient movement of a drug molecule from the laboratory to the clinic is needed to make antiviral therapy for dengue a reality in the coming future.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An overview of the experimental dengue drugs being developed around the world as reflected in the recent patent literature spanning the last few years is provided."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1380,"details":{"paperId":"a07c1688aaea5dcf268c68f66c8d75551e0b1118","externalIds":{"MAG":"886618342","DOI":"10.1016/j.bmc.2015.07.012","CorpusId":"22307857","PubMed":"26233795"},"title":"Dual inhibitors of the dengue and West Nile virus NS2B-NS3 proteases: Synthesis, biological evaluation and docking studies of novel peptide-hybrids.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The synthesis, characterization, biological evaluation and docking studies of novel peptide-hybrids based on 2,4-thiazolidinedione scaffolds containing non-polar groups finding the most promising compound has an IC50 of 0.75 μM against WNV protease, which represents a seventyfold improvement in activity compared to previously reported compounds."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6645,"details":{"paperId":"ff565cef23dfc59c9de5568cd34f8f69abeb3f44","externalIds":{"MAG":"2007189964","PubMedCentral":"4408003","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1004852","CorpusId":"9919538","PubMed":"25906260"},"title":"Dual miRNA Targeting Restricts Host Range and Attenuates Neurovirulence of Flaviviruses","abstract":"Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are among the most significant arboviral pathogens worldwide. Vaccinations and mosquito population control programs remain the most reliable means for flavivirus disease prevention, and live attenuated viruses remain one of the most attractive flavivirus vaccine platforms. Some live attenuated viruses are capable of infecting principle mosquito vectors, as demonstrated in the laboratory, which in combination with their intrinsic genetic instability could potentially lead to a vaccine virus reversion back to wild-type in nature, followed by introduction and dissemination of potentially dangerous viral strains into new geographic locations. To mitigate this risk we developed a microRNA-targeting approach that selectively restricts replication of flavivirus in the mosquito host. Introduction of sequences complementary to a mosquito-specific mir-184 and mir-275 miRNAs individually or in combination into the 3’NCR and/or ORF region resulted in selective restriction of dengue type 4 virus (DEN4) replication in mosquito cell lines and adult Aedes mosquitos. Moreover a combined targeting of DEN4 genome with mosquito-specific and vertebrate CNS-specific mir-124 miRNA can silence viral replication in two evolutionally distant biological systems: mosquitoes and mouse brains. Thus, this approach can reinforce the safety of newly developed or existing vaccines for use in humans and could provide an additional level of biosafety for laboratories using viruses with altered pathogenic or transmissibility characteristics.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A microRNA-targeting approach that selectively restricts replication of flavivirus in the mosquito host can reinforce the safety of newly developed or existing vaccines for use in humans and could provide an additional level of biosafety for laboratories using viruses with altered pathogenic or transmissibility characteristics."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1191,"details":{"paperId":"b4e145d22b27579dc1a7f43db76e94c1672fd380","externalIds":{"MAG":"2944020377","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.05.004","CorpusId":"155088830","PubMed":"31085206"},"title":"Dual targeting of dengue virus virions and NS1 protein with the heparan sulfate mimic PG545.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that the dual targeting of DENV virions and NS1 using GAG analogues offers a new avenue for DENV drug development, and PG545 treatment moderately improves survival from lethal DENV challenge in a murine model."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5109,"details":{"paperId":"b9a3fefe5d1f73588903711ec6119837e990da10","externalIds":{"MAG":"2338930119","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.02727-15","CorpusId":"4780588","PubMed":"27076639"},"title":"Dynamic Nucleolar Targeting of Dengue Virus Polymerase NS5 in Response to Extracellular pH","abstract":"ABSTRACT The nucleolar subcompartment of the nucleus is increasingly recognized as an important target of RNA viruses. Here we document for the first time the ability of dengue virus (DENV) polymerase, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), to accumulate within the nucleolus of infected cells and to target green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the nucleolus of live transfected cells. Intriguingly, NS5 exchange between the nucleus and nucleolus is dynamically modulated by extracellular pH, responding rapidly and reversibly to pH change, in contrast to GFP alone or other nucleolar and non-nucleolar targeted protein controls. The minimal pH-sensitive nucleolar targeting region (pHNTR), sufficient to target GFP to the nucleolus in a pH-sensitive fashion, was mapped to NS5 residues 1 to 244, with mutation of key hydrophobic residues, Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168, abolishing pHNTR function in NS5-transfected cells, and severely attenuating DENV growth in infected cells. This is the first report of a viral protein whose nucleolar targeting ability is rapidly modulated by extracellular stimuli, suggesting that DENV has the ability to detect and respond dynamically to the extracellular environment. IMPORTANCE Infections by dengue virus (DENV) threaten 40% of the world's population yet there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapeutic to treat infections. Understanding the molecular details that govern effective viral replication is key for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Here, we describe for the first time dynamic trafficking of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) to the subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. We demonstrate that NS5's targeting to the nucleolus occurs in response to acidic pH, identify the key amino acid residues within NS5 that are responsible, and demonstrate that their mutation severely impairs production of infectious DENV. Overall, this study identifies a unique subcellular trafficking event and suggests that DENV is able to detect and respond dynamically to environmental changes.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":670,"details":{"paperId":"c289f898bfdaf34d7f87f0f0573b25db0fd64eae","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s10867-018-9515-6","CorpusId":"254656760"},"title":"Dynamics and binding interactions of peptide inhibitors of dengue virus entry","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work showcases the use of computational study in elucidating and explaining the experiment observation on an atomic level and shows that both the DET2 and DET4 trigger different dynamic patterns on the domain III."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7536,"details":{"paperId":"08c7b2a83d684e8324343941f66183f047396f05","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8289389","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2021.686691","CorpusId":"235729710","PubMed":"34290707"},"title":"Dynamics of the Magnitude, Breadth and Depth of the Antibody Response at Epitope Level Following Dengue Infection","abstract":"Dengue is a major public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. Since the Zika epidemic and the increased co-circulation of other arboviruses, the serology-based diagnosis of dengue has become more problematic due to the high antigenic resemblance, especially among the flavivirus family. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the diversity, specificity and temporal evolution of the antibody response following dengue infection is needed. In order to close this knowledge gap, we used a high-density peptide microarray of 9,072 linear peptides covering the entire proteome diversity of dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses. The IgM and IgG antibody responses were measured against the designed microarray in symptomatic dengue infected individuals from an arbovirus endemic area in Peru and in overseas travelers returning to Belgium, as representatives of multiple-exposed and primary infections, respectively. Serum samples were collected longitudinally across four time points over the period of six months in Peru and over two time points in travelers. We show that epitopes eliciting the strongest flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies, in both primary and secondary infections were concentrated in the capsid, E, NS1, NS3 and NS5 proteins. The IgG antibody responses against NS1 and NS3 followed a rise-and-fall pattern, with peak titers between two to four weeks after onset of illness. The response to the E and NS5 proteins increased rapidly in the acute phase and was maintained at stable levels until at least 6 months after illness. A more scattered IgM antibody reactivity across the viral proteome was observed in the acute phase of the disease and that persisted through the 6-month window. The magnitude, breadth (i.e. number of unique epitopes targeted) and depth (i.e. number of epitope variants recognized) of the IgG response was higher in secondary infections compared to primary infections. For IgM antibodies, the magnitude of the response was higher in primary infected individuals whereas the breadth and depth of the response was lower in this group compared with the endemic subjects. Finally, through this arboviral proteome-wide epitope mapping, we were able to identify IgM and IgG dengue-specific epitopes which can be useful serological markers for dengue diagnosis and serostatus determination.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that epitopes eliciting the strongest flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies, in both primary and secondary infections were concentrated in the capsid, E, NS1, NS3 and NS5 proteins, which followed a rise-and-fall pattern, with peak titers between two to four weeks after onset of illness."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3898,"details":{"paperId":"63325fe124e53cdaff3ee01f83736c1171eef196","externalIds":{"MAG":"2952934410","DOI":"10.1093/infdis/jiy434","CorpusId":"51629500","PubMed":"30010906"},"title":"Early transcriptional responses after dengue vaccination mirror the response to natural infection and predict neutralizing antibody titers","abstract":"Background Several promising live attenuated virus (LAV) dengue vaccines are in development, but information about innate immune responses and early correlates of protection are lacking.

We compared day-specific gene expression patterns with subsequent neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers. Results The transcriptional response to vaccination was largely confined to days 5–20 and was dominated by an interferon-associated signature and a cell cycle signature that peaked on days 8 and 14, respectively.

Little is known about the disease burden and economic impact of dengue in higher resourced countries or the cost-effectiveness of potential dengue vaccines in such settings. Methods and Findings We estimate the direct and indirect costs of dengue from hospitalized and ambulatory cases in Singapore. We consider inter alia the impacts of dengue on the economy using the human-capital and the friction cost methods. Disease burden was estimated using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the cost-effectiveness of a potential vaccine program was evaluated. The average economic impact of dengue illness in Singapore from 2000 to 2009 in constant 2010 US$ ranged between $0.85 billion and $1.15 billion, of which control costs constitute 42%–59%. Using empirically derived disability weights, we estimated an annual average disease burden of 9–14 DALYs per 100 000 habitants, making it comparable to diseases such as hepatitis B or syphilis. The proportion of symptomatic dengue cases detected by the national surveillance system was estimated to be low, and to decrease with age. Under population projections by the United Nations, the price per dose threshold for which vaccines stop being more cost-effective than the current vector control program ranged from $50 for mass vaccination requiring 3 doses and only conferring 10 years of immunity to $300 for vaccination requiring 2 doses and conferring lifetime immunity. The thresholds for these vaccine programs to not be cost-effective for Singapore were $100 and $500 per dose respectively.

Similarly to yellow fever, dengue is caused by viruses of the flaviviridae family and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, but unlike yellow fever for which we have had a vaccine for more than 80 years, the first dengue vaccine is only available now. Research and Development funding for dengue vaccine development has more than tripled in the past decades, much of which is driven by vaccine manufacturers [2]. We have a robust pipeline with several promising dengue vaccine candidates, all using different approaches [3]. The only vaccine to have completed Phase 3 trials is the CYDTDV (a live attenuated recombinant chimeric tetravalent dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur) sponsored by Sanofi Pasteur. Interestingly, the relatedness to other flaviviruses played a role in the development of CYD-TDV in which the 17D yellow fever virus backbone is used for chimerization with dengue viruses (DENVs). CYD-TDV is a formulation of four chimeras, each one engineered to express the envelope and pre-membrane proteins from one of the four serotypes of DENV [4]. Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) was first licensed in Mexico in December 2015, and is meanwhile licensed in three other countries. Pooled efficacy data of CYD-TDV from phase 3 trials conducted in over 30,000 children aged 2–16 years in 10 countries (5 in Asia, and 5 in Latin America) have shown this vaccine to have mixed performance: efficacy varied widely depending on serotype, baseline flavivirus priming status (i.e. prior DENV infection status) and age [5]. Protection against serotypes 3 and 4 was good, but marginal against serotype 1 and poor against serotype 2. Absence of prior DENV infection was associated with low efficacy. Higher age had an overall beneficial impact on efficacy: among individuals aged 9–16 years, efficacy against virologically confirmed DENV infection regardless of severity and serotype was higher (66%) than in those below 9 years (45%). Efficacy against severe dengue and hospitalization was also higher (93% and 81%, respectively) in individuals aged 9 years or older, compared with 45% and 56% in children younger than 9 years [6]. Eliciting the reasons for the imbalanced efficacy results is now a subject of intense research. Did the CYD-TDV act as a monovalent or bivalent vaccine mainly against serotype 3 and 4 only despite high antibodies against all serotypes as measured by the plaque reduction neutralization assay [7]? Are the high geometric mean titre titers for antibodies against all four serotypes after administering three doses of the vaccines perhaps more a reflection of the shortlived heterotypic immunity seen after natural infection with one serotype rather than long-lasting homotypic immunity? Did viral interference among the vaccine strains impact this imbalance in efficacy? Were the target neutralizing antibody titers during vaccine development too low for serotype 2? Alternatively, is there something unique about serotype 2 with unclear implications for different vaccine design strategies? As the CYD-TDV vaccine does not contain the nonstructural proteins of DENV, one area of research has included the role of nonstructural proteins in dengue pathogenesis. For example, the potentially important role of NS1, one of the nonstructural proteins, in the pathway leading to increased vascular permeability was recently demonstrated in a mouse model. Immunization of mice with NS1 from DENV-1 to DENV4 provided protection against lethal DENV-2 challenge [8]. Furthermore, since natural DENV infection elicits both neutralizing antibodies and broad T-cell responses, efficient and long-lasting immunity induced by vaccination may require elements of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity [9]. Natural infection induces dengue-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes that are highly activated and exhibit antiviral effector functions [10]. A vigorous response by multifunctional CD8(+) T cells has been associated with protection from dengue disease [11]. Lastly, still little is known about the role of innate immune response in pathogenesis which would warrant further research [8]. Data from three years of follow-up of the CYD-TDV multicountry phase 3 trials combined with four years of followup of the single-country phase 2b trial in Thailand allow more insights into the safety of CYD-TDV. It should be noted that after the second year, only passive (hospitalbased) surveillance was conducted and, hence, only data on hospitalized dengue cases (but not overall number of virologically confirmed dengue cases) are available. This follow-up data revealed an increased number of hospitalized dengue cases in vaccinees compared to controls during the third year of the Asian Phase 3 trial in those younger than 9 years, which was much more pronounced in the youngest children (i.e. 2–5 years of age) who had an almost eight-fold increased risk of hospitalizations due to dengue. This increased risk was not observed in this age EXPERT REVIEW OF VACCINES, 2016 VOL. 15, NO. 4, 433–435 http://dx.doi.org/10.1586/14760584.2016.1154459","publicationTypes":["Editorial","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Eliciting the reasons for the imbalanced efficacy results of the CYD-TDV vaccine is now a subject of intense research."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3803,"details":{"paperId":"4f641efc3bb0128757aa80e388b78c917a62ea03","externalIds":{"MAG":"2114856717","DOI":"10.1093/cid/cis657","CorpusId":"13255975","PubMed":"22865873"},"title":"Editorial commentary. Short-course oral corticosteroid therapy is not effective in early dengue infection.","abstract":"Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide [1]. More than 3 billion people in >120 countries are at risk from dengue with 50–100 million infections each year, of which >2 million will have severe dengue infection, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Dengue is a disease with great morbidity, but fortunately only <25 000 die of the disease. Clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic, to febrile illness, to severe dengue involving systemic plasma leakage with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy [2]. Severe disease is usually seen at a time after viremia has reduced to low or undetectable levels, suggesting that it is an immunopathologically mediated disease [3]. Although it is clear that cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage are infected, our understanding of the cell and tissue tropism of dengue viruse (DENV) is limited. The disease is caused by 4 serologically and genetically related viruses, called DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, which are members of the flavivirus genus, whose prototype species is yellow fever virus [1, 4]. The 4 DENVs are often considered serotypes, like the 3 poliovirus serotypes; however, the 4 DENVs are distinct viral species and have the same relationships to each other as 4 members of the Japanese encephalitis complex of viruses ( Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, St Louis encephalitis, and West Nile virus). Taking the above-mentioned together, it is not surprising that the development of vaccines or antiviral drugs against dengue has been and continues to be a complex issue. Currently, there are no licensed drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent dengue, although there are candidate vaccines in phase 2/3 clinical trials [5]. Even if a vaccine were available tomorrow, there would be still a need for antiviral drugs. Antiviral drug development has focused on 2 approaches: identifying candidate drugs that act specifically against virus-encoded proteins, and drug regimens that can provide supportive therapy and augment the patient’s response to the virus infection [6]. A number of candidate antiviral drugs are in advanced preclinical development and a few are in early clinical development, but none are in clinical efficacy studies. Thus, supportive therapy regimens are an area of keen interest. The study by Dong et al in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, “A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial to Investigate the Effects of Short-Course Oral Corticosteroid Therapy in Early Dengue Infection in Vietnamese Patients,” investigates an important area of potential supportive therapy, namely, the use of oral corticosteroid therapy to combat clinical dengue disease. There have been a number of suggestions in the literature that corticosteroids may have a beneficial effect on patients following infection by viral and bacterial agents where the host immune response contributes to clinical disease. Clearly, dengue is a disease for which corticosteroids could be considered as an intervention, in particular a short course of oral steroid therapy to suppress the inflammatory response early in the disease course to reduce the potential of severe dengue disease, but this has not been studied systematically until now. Dong et al investigated the effects of short-term oral corticosteroid therapy given early in dengue infection with a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded trial of clinical outcomes of serologically and virologically documented dengue disease in 225 children who were given either 2 days of low or high doses of oral Received 16 July 2012; accepted 24 July 2012; electronically published 3 August 2012.

The grant is very much needed to accelerate the development and introduction of a dengue vaccine. Dengue, especially its more sinister forms dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), is a frightening disease. This mosquito-borne illness strikes suddenly, causing ‘break-bone’ fever with the risk of capillary leakage, bleeding and death. An estimated 50 million dengue infections occur annually, including 500 000 cases of DHF/DSS, with 24 000 deaths mostly in children. The burden is greatest in tropical Asia where dengue is a leading cause of paediatric hospitalization. Before 1970, only nine countries were reporting DHF epidemics, a number which has since increased more than fourfold (World Health Organization 2000). In recent years, several Latin American countries have been experiencing dengue outbreaks with serious consequences. The battle against dengue has focused on improving recognition and case management. The need for differentiation from other causes of fever and the lack of clinical predictors of severe disease complicate diagnosis. During the dengue season, particularly during outbreaks that occur every 3–4 years, health care facilities are inundated by fearful parents bringing in febrile children for evaluation and admission. Due to the progressive nature of the illness, repeated assessments over a period of about 3–7 days of fever are necessary. Lenient hospitalization policies allow close observation and improve outcome but use up precious resources. The illness is particularly cruel in that complications usually occur just as the patient starts to defervesce. The cornerstone of management is closely monitored intravenous fluid replacement. Where skilled staff and facilities are available, the case-fatality rate has been brought down to <1% but remains as high as 10–30% in poor countries or during outbreaks. The occurrence of repeat dengue episodes aggravates the situation. The virus has four serotypes and infection with one provides life-long immunity against that same but not the other serotypes. Not only do repeated episodes occur but the risk of severe illness is increased at least 15-fold during secondary compared with primary infections (Halstead 1980). Various mechanisms have been suggested to explain this phenomenon. Enhancement of virus replication in mononuclear cells by antibodies from a previous heterologous dengue virus infection has been demonstrated (Halstead 1988). Most recently, investigators have suggested that increased T-cell activation and apoptosis may contribute to the systemic disturbances leading to DHF (Mongkolsapaya et al. 2003). The impact of dengue is not only in terms of suffering from disease and death. Dengue imposes an economic burden including private expenditures for medical care and time taken from work to look after ill family members; government costs for provision of treatment and control activities; and lost revenue from tourism and industry. Currently, there is no sustainable preventive approach against dengue. Community-based mosquito control projects have succeeded on a small scale but national programmes have only been effective under strong central government supervision. Vector control has not provided wide-spread and long-lasting results. Vaccination offers greater hope as an effective and sustainable strategy (Jacobs 2000). Several multivalent dengue vaccines are in various stages of development but none of them is close to licensure (Halstead & Deen 2002). A live attenuated vaccine is thought to be the most promising design. Live attenuated viral vaccines actively replicate in the host resulting in an array of wild virus-like antigens, which could potentially provoke a response similar to natural immunity. Intracellular replication of the virus elicits strong cytotoxic T-cell responses. Long-term memory T-cells and immunity are exceptionally durable and complete immunization may be achieved with few doses (Monath et al. 2002).

Patients with post-transfusion platelet increment (PPI) ≥10,000/μl and/or corrected count increment (CCI) ≥5,000/μl 1 h post-transfusion were considered responders. Primary outcome was platelet count increments at 24 and 72 h. Results: 87 patients were enrolled, and 43 (48.2%) received platelet transfusion.

Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of Carica papaya leaf extract (CPLE) in the management of severe thrombocytopenia (≤30,000/μL) in dengue infection. 51 laboratory confirmed adult dengue patients with platelet counts ≤30,000/μL were randomly assigned to either treatment (n = 26) or placebo (n = 24) group. By day 3, CPLE treated patients reported significantly (p = 0.007) increased platelet counts (482%± 284) compared to placebo (331%±370) group. In the treatment group, fewer patients received platelet transfusions (1/26 v/s 2/24) and their median time for platelets to recover to ≥ 50,000/μL was 2 days (IQR 2–3) compared to 3 days (IQR 2–4) in placebo. Overall, CPLE was safe and well tolerated with no significant decrease in mean hospitalization days. Plasma cytokine profiling revealed that by day 3, mean percent increase in TNFα and IFNγ levels in treatment group was less compared to that observed in placebos; (TNFα: 58.6% v/s 127.5%; p = 0.25 and IFNγ: 1.93% v/s 62.6% for; p = 0.12). While a mean percent increase in IL-6 levels occurred in placebos (15.92%±29.93%) by day 3, a decrease was noted in CPLE group (12.95%±21.75%; p = 0.0232). Inversely, CPLE treated patients reported a mean percent increase compared to placebo by day 3 (143% ±115.7% v/s 12.03%± 48.4%; p = 0.006). Further, by day 3, a faster clearance kinetics of viral NS1 antigenemia occurred–mean NS1 titers in treatment group decreased to 97.3% compared to 88% in placebos (p = 0.023).

Materials and Methods: Randomized controlled trials related to the efficacy and safety of C. papaya leaf extract in dengue were searched from PubMed, Cochrane Clinical Trial Registry and Google Scholar. The primary endpoint was mortality, and secondary endpoints were increase in platelet count, hospitalization days, and Grade 3 and 4 adverse events. Data related to primary and secondary endpoints were pooled together and analyzed by review manager (Review Manager (RevMan) Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Denmark) software. The random effect model was used. The bias was analyzed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Total four trials enrolling 439 subjects were included in the analysis. Of 439 subjects, data of 377 subjects were available for analysis. C. papaya leaf extract was found to be associated with increase in platelet count in the overall analysis (mean difference [MD] =20.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.21–34.73; P= 0.005]) and analysis after 4th day (MD = 28.25 [95% CI 14.14–42.37; P< 0.0001]). After 48 h, there was no significant difference between C. papaya and control group (MD = 13.38 [95% CI − 7.71–34.51; P = 0.21]). There was significant decrease in hospitalization days in the C. papaya group (MD = 1.90 [95% CI 1.62–2.18; P< 0.00001]). Because of nonavailability of data in published clinical trials, mortality, and adverse events cannot be pooled. Conclusion: C. papaya leaf extract can be considered as a potential candidate for increase in platelet count in patients of dengue, however; there is need of high-quality evidence in the form of large clinical trials before a decision related to the use of such extract is made.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"C. papaya leaf extract can be considered as a potential candidate for increase in platelet count in patients of dengue, however; there is need of high-quality evidence in the form of large clinical trials before a decision related to the use of such extract is made."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2796,"details":{"paperId":"da52f7b3eace2ebeedaf431c76f09f42029620a2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2019515228","DOI":"10.1016/S1473-3099(14)70730-3","CorpusId":"902755","PubMed":"24877997"},"title":"Efficacy and safety of celgosivir in patients with dengue fever (CELADEN): a phase 1b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","ClinicalTrial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Although generally safe and well tolerated, celgosivir does not seem to reduce viral load or fever burden in patients with dengue."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7018,"details":{"paperId":"b8f5da63cbc246ebaaec4b0997430c24f396a9b5","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.20473/fmi.v57i4.21741","CorpusId":"245032744"},"title":"Efficacy of Live Attenuated Dengue Vaccines: CYD-TDV; TDV (TAK-003) and TV003/TV005","abstract":"Highlight:Differences in the efficacy of CYD-TDV versus the other TAK-003 and TV003/TV005 were discussed.One licensed dengue vaccine is CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia). Abstract:Dengue fever is the most common tropical disease, but there still remains no specific therapy that can overcome it. Special attention needs to be paid to this disease, because there were large increases in incidence in the last decade. As an effective preventive strategy, finding a new vaccine for dengue fever with higher potentiation and efficacy is highly necessary to stop dengue transmission especially in the endemic area. Vaccine triggers an immune response, so that it can create a robust immune response when infected. Nowadays, there is only one licensed dengue vaccine that is CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia). However, this vaccine still has many weaknesses, namely its dependency on the serostatus of the recipient. There are also other dengue vaccines that are in ongoing clinical testing and have promising results, TDV (TAK-003) and TV003/TV005. These three vaccines are live attenuated vaccines with various results.

The majority of protective, neutralizing antibodies induced during infection are targeted by the envelope (E) protein, making it an ideal candidate for a subunit vaccine approach. Using truncated, recombinant, secreted E proteins (sE) of all 4 dengue virus serotypes, we have assessed their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice, with or without Quil-A as an adjuvant, and delivered via micropatch array (MPA) to the skin in comparison with more traditional routes of immunization.

This study has elucidated the antiviral mechanisms of natural small molecules against the dengue (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Herbacetin (HC) and Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) depleted polyamine levels in Vero cells, which has been demonstrated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). As polyamines play an essential role in the replication and transcription of RNA viruses, the depletion of polyamines by HC and CAPE was anticipated to inhibit the virus replication. To test this hypothesis, HC and CAPE were evaluated for antiviral activities using a cell-based virus yield assay by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), plaque reduction assay, and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). HC and CAPE displayed potent inhibition with EC50 of 463 nM and 0.417 nM for CHIKV and 8.5 µM and 1.15 µM for DENV, respectively. However, the addition of exogenous polyamines did not ultimately rescue the virus titer in both CHIKV and DENV-infected cells. This finding suggested additional antiviral mechanisms for HC and CAPE. Further, in silico analysis revealed that HC and CAPE may directly target the viral methyltransferases (MTase) of CHIKV and DENV. The inhibition of virus-specific MTases by HC and CAPE was confirmed using purified viral MTase of CHIKV and DENV. Altogether, the dual targeting of the host pathway and the viral MTase using potent natural antiviral molecules is expected to facilitate the development of effective biological therapies. IMPORTANCE Vector-borne diseases caused by DENV and CHIKV has a catastrophic impact on human health worldwide. There are no effective vaccines and antiviral drugs present in the market till date against these viruses. In the present study, natural small molecules have been identified as antivirals against DENV and CHIKV.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus is the most globally prevalent mosquito-transmitted virus. Primary infection with one of four cocirculating serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) causes a febrile illness, but secondary infection with a heterologous serotype can result in severe disease, due in part to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE). In ADE, cross-reactive but nonneutralizing antibodies, or subprotective levels of neutralizing antibodies, promote uptake of antibody-opsonized virus in Fc-γ receptor-positive cells. Thus, elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), but not nonneutralizing antibodies, is desirable for dengue vaccine development. Domain III of the envelope glycoprotein (EDIII) is targeted by bNAbs and thus is an attractive immunogen. However, immunization with EDIII results in sera with limited neutralization breadth. We developed “resurfaced” EDIII immunogens (rsDIIIs) in which the A/G strand epitope that is targeted by bNAb 4E11 is maintained but less desirable epitopes are masked. RsDIIIs bound 4E11, but not serotype-specific or nonneutralizing antibodies. One rsDIII and, unexpectedly, wild-type (WT) DENV-2 EDIII elicited cross-neutralizing antibody responses against DENV-1 to -3 in mice. While these sera were cross-neutralizing, they were not sufficiently potent to protect AG129 immunocompromised mice at a dose of 200 μl (50% focus reduction neutralization titer [FRNT50], ∼1:60 to 1:130) against mouse-adapted DENV-2.

The A. aegypti carboxypeptidase A promoter was used to express the IR RNA in midgut epithelial cells after ingestion of a bloodmeal.

In this article, we describe application of an infectious clone system for DENV serotype 1 (DENV1).

Comparison of the virus derived from the infectious clone with the original viral isolate reveals identical sequence, comparable endpoint titers, and similar focus staining. Both focus-forming assays and percent infection by flow cytometry revealed overlapping replication levels in two different cell types. Moreover, serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) bound similarly to infectious clone and the natural isolate.

Sequence analysis showed that one antigenic variant contained a Gly-to-Val substitution at position 106 within the flavivirus-conserved fusion peptide loop of the envelope protein (E), and another variant contained a His-to-Gln substitution at position 317 in E. Substitution of Gly106Val in DENV-2 E reduced the binding affinity of Fab 1A5 by approximately 80-fold, whereas substitution of His317Gln had little or no effect on antibody binding compared to the parental virus. Treatment of DENV-2 with β-mercaptoethanol abolished binding of Fab 1A5, indicating that disulfide bridges were required for the structural integrity of the Fab 1A5 epitope. Binding of Fab 1A5 to DENV-2 was competed by an oligopeptide containing the fusion peptide sequence as shown by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both DENV-2 antigenic variants were shown to be attenuated, or at least similar to the parental virus, when evaluated for growth in cultured cells or for neurovirulence in mice. Fab 1A5 inhibited low pH-induced membrane fusion of mosquito C6/36 cells infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2, as detected by reduced syncytium formation. Both substitutions in DENV-2 E lowered the pH threshold for membrane fusion, as measured in a fusion-from-within assay. In the three-dimensional structure of E, Gly106 in domain II and His317 in domain III of the opposite E monomer were spatially close.

Hence, the development of a dengue vaccine that is dually cost-effective and able to confer a comprehensive protection is ultimately needed. In this study, a consensus sequence of the antigenic dengue viral glycoprotein domain III (cEDIII) was used aiming to provide comprehensive coverage against all four circulating dengue viral serotypes and potential clade replacement event. Utilizing hepatitis B tandem core technology, the cEDIII sequence was inserted into the immunodominant c/e1 loop region so that it could be displayed on the spike structures of assembled particles. The tandem core particles displaying cEDIII epitopes (tHBcAg-cEDIII) were successfully produced in Nicotiana benthamiana via Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression strategy to give a protein of ∼54 kDa, detected in both soluble and insoluble fractions of plant extracts. The assembled tHBcAg-cEDIII virus-like particles (VLPs) were also visualized from transmission electron microscopy. These VLPs had diameters that range from 32 to 35 nm, presenting an apparent size increment as compared to tHBcAg control particles without cEDIII display (namely tEL). Mice immunized with tHBcAg-cEDIII VLPs showed a positive seroconversion to cEDIII antigen, thereby signifying that the assembled tHBcAg-cEDIII VLPs have successfully displayed cEDIII antigen to the immune system.

Control measures have not been enough and specific means of treatment and prevention are still not available. Advances in dengue vaccines design through innovative technologies have been made in the last decades. Most of theses vaccines are in pre-clinical stages of development and only some of them have reached clinical stages, with promising results.

Currently, no vaccines or standard therapy is avaliable to treate DENV infection. This makes the drug development against DENV more significant and challenging. The MTase domain of DENV RNA RdRp NS5 is a promising drug target, because this domain hosts the RNA capping process of DENV RNA to escape from human immune system. In the present study, we have analysed the RNA intervention mechanism exerted by flavoniod molecules against NS5 MTase RNA capping site by using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and the binding free energy calculations. The results from the docking analysis confirmed that the RNA intervention mecanism is exerted by the quercetagetin (QGN) molecule with all necessary intermolecular interactions and high binding affinity. Notably, QGN forms strong hydrogen bonding interactions with Asn18, Leu20 and Ser150 residues and π⋅⋅⋅π stacking interaction with Phe25 residue. The apo and QGN bound NS5 MTase and QGN-NS5 MTase complex were used for MD simulation. The results of MD simulation reveal that the RMSD and RMSF values of QGN-MTase complex have increased on comparing the apo protein due to the effect of ligand binding. The binding free energy calulation includes prediction of total binding free energy of ligand-protein complex and per-residue free energy decomposition.

ABSTRACT Every year, millions of people worldwide are infected with dengue virus (DENV), with a significant number developing severe life-threatening disease. There are currently no broadly indicated vaccines or therapeutics available for treatment of DENV infection. Here, we show that AT-281, the free base of AT-752, an orally available double prodrug of a guanosine nucleotide analog, was a potent inhibitor of DENV serotypes 2 and 3 in vitro, requiring concentrations of 0.48 and 0.77 μM, respectively, to inhibit viral replication by 50% (EC50) in Huh-7 cells. AT-281 was also a potent inhibitor of all other flaviviruses tested, with EC50 values ranging from 0.19 to 1.41 μM. Little to no cytotoxicity was observed for AT-281 at concentrations up to 170 μM. After oral administration of AT-752, substantial levels of the active triphosphate metabolite AT-9010 were formed in vivo in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of mice, rats, and monkeys. Furthermore, AT-9010 competed with GTP in RNA template-primer elongation assays with DENV2 RNA polymerase, which is essential for viral replication, with incorporation of AT-9010 resulting in termination of RNA synthesis. In AG129 mice infected with DENV D2Y98P, treatment with AT-752 significantly reduced viremia and morbidity and increased survival. The demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity of AT-752 suggests that it is a promising compound for the treatment of dengue virus infection and is currently under evaluation in clinical studies.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity of AT-752 suggests that it is a promising compound for the treatment of dengue virus infection and is currently under evaluation in clinical studies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":179,"details":{"paperId":"0dadfd640204c0f8fc60a5ec83f8315147efb363","externalIds":{"MAG":"2062907307","DOI":"10.1002/minf.201200107","CorpusId":"38203043","PubMed":"27481277"},"title":"Evaluation of Adamantane Derivatives as Inhibitors of Dengue Virus mRNA Cap Methyltransferase by Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulations","abstract":"Binding of the Dengue virus S‐adenosyl‐L‐methionine (AdoMet)‐dependent mRNA cap methyltransferase (NS5MTaseDV) with adamantane derivatives was explored using molecular modeling methods and (nucleoside‐2′O)‐methyltransferase bioassay.

The urea derivatives of adamantanes had previously been identified as inhibitors of NS5MTaseDV. The docking simulations using GOLD, Glide, and Dock give consistent binding modes and binding affinities of adamantanes in the AdoMet‐binding site of NS5MTaseDV and, in particular, yield similar positions for the previously found inhibitors. Combined, they perfectly correspond to the bioassay measurements of nucleoside‐2′O‐methyltransferase activity of NS5TaseDV, which confirmed inhibitory properties of the active urea adamantane but did not show inhibitory activity for amantadine and rimantadine. We also employed microscopic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a linear interaction energy (LIE) method to verify the docking results. The MD/LIE binding free energies of selected protein–inhibitor complexes agree overall with the binding affinities from docking and demonstrate that amantadine and rimantadine only weakly bind at the explored site.

The use of noninfectious subviral extracellular particles (EPs) is an inexpensive and safe strategy for the production of protein-based flavivirus vaccines. Although coexpression of premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins has been demonstrated to produce EPs in mammalian cells, low yields have hindered their commercial application. Therefore, we used an insect cell expression system with Spodoptera frugiperda-derived Sf9 cells to investigate high-level production of DENV2 and JEV EPs. Sf9 cells transfected with the prM and E genes of DENV2 or JEV secreted corresponding viral antigens in a particulate form that were biochemically and biophysically equivalent to the authentic antigens obtained from infected C6/36 mosquito cells. Additionally, equivalent neutralizing antibody titers were induced in mice immunized either with EPs produced by transfected Sf9 cells or with EPs produced by transfected mammalian cells, in the context of coimmunization with a DNA vaccine that expresses EPs. Furthermore, the results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using an EP antigen derived from Sf9 cells correlated significantly with the results obtained by a neutralization test and an ELISA using an EP antigen derived from mammalian cells. Finally, Sf9 cells could produce 10- to 100-fold larger amounts of E antigen than mammalian cells. These results indicate the potential of Sf9 cells for high-level production of flavivirus protein vaccines and diagnostic

The search for active phytochemicals could serve for the discovery of new drugs. This study aims to evaluate the antiviral activity in vitro of compounds found in essential oils from medicinal plants. Materials and Methods: Nine synthetic-derived essential oil compounds were evaluated. Antiviral effect was screened measuring the reduction of viral NS1 and E proteins in HepG-2 and Vero cells. Results: β-Caryophyllene was identified as the most active compound, it reduced the virus serotype-2 replication in HepG-2 cells at IC50 of 22 ± 5.6 μM, and blocked replication of all four serotypes in Vero cells at IC50 between 8.0 μM and 15.0 μM. The selectivity indexes were between 5.3 and 10. According to results from time-in-addition assays, the antiviral effect of β-caryophyllene appears to be associated with interruption of early steps of the virus life cycle.

Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine–loaded PLGA/PEG microspheres exhibited a high loading capacity (4.5% w/w), yield (85.2%), and entrapment efficiency (39%), the mean particle size 4.8 μm, and a controlled in vitro release profile with a low initial burst (18.5%), lag time (4 days), and continued released protein over 70 days.

In this study, bioinformatics approaches were used to predict antigenic, immunogenic, non-allergenic, and conserved B and T-cell epitopes as promising targets to design an effective peptide-based vaccine against dengue virus. Molecular docking analysis indicated the deep binding of the identified epitopes in the binding groove of the most popular human MHC I allele (human leukocyte antigens [HLA] A*0201). The final vaccine construct was created by conjugating the B and T-cell identified epitopes using proper linkers and adding an appropriate adjuvant at the N-terminal. The characteristics of the new subunit vaccine demonstrated that the epitope-based vaccine was antigenic, non-toxic, stable, and soluble. Other physicochemical properties of the new designed construct including isoelectric point value, aliphatic index, and grand average of hydropathicity were biologically considerable. Molecular docking of the engineered vaccine with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) model revealed the hydrophobic interaction between the adjuvant and the ligand binding regions in the hydrophobic channel of TLR2.

Methods: Each 24‐well plate of Vero cells infected with all four DENV serotypes, singly, was subjected to treatments with various doses of AR‐12. Following 48 h of incubation, inhibitory efficacies of AR‐12 against the different DENV serotypes were evaluated by conducting a virus yield reduction assay whereby DENV RNA copy numbers present in the collected supernatant were quantified using qRT‐PCR. The underlying mechanism(s) possibly involved in the compound's inhibitory activities were then investigated by performing molecular docking on several potential target human and DENV protein domains. Results: The qRT‐PCR data demonstrated that DENV‐3 was most potently inhibited by AR‐12, followed by DENV‐1, DENV‐2 and DENV‐4. Our molecular docking findings suggested that AR‐12 possibly exerted its inhibitory effects by interfering with the chaperone activities of heat shock proteins. Conclusions: These results serve as vital information for the design of future studies involving in vitro mechanistic studies and animal models, aiming to decipher the potential of AR‐12 as a potential therapeutic option for DENV infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Evaluated efficacy of the celecoxib derivative AR‐12 against the in vitro replication of all four DENV serotypes suggested that AR‐ 12 possibly exerted its inhibitory effects by interfering with the chaperone activities of heat shock proteins."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2087,"details":{"paperId":"d8af0c8d96b5c57ceba296903febb3bbd7d94d08","externalIds":{"MAG":"2460714393","DOI":"10.1016/j.pep.2016.06.006","CorpusId":"22089871","PubMed":"27335159"},"title":"Expression and assembly of cholera toxin B subunit and domain III of dengue virus 2 envelope fusion protein in transgenic potatoes.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that dengue virus antigen could be produced in potatoes, raising the possibility that edible plants are employed in mucosal vaccines for protection against d Dengue infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1777,"details":{"paperId":"cb2c6488ccc68a1299b7539f9af9829bea2feb6a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2401891682","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbiosc.2014.06.005","CorpusId":"19731570","PubMed":"25027708"},"title":"Expression and characterization of an M cell-specific ligand-fused dengue virus tetravalent epitope using Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In vivo binding assays showed that the Tet-EDIII-Co1 protein was delivered specifically to M cells in Peyer's patches while the tetravalent protein lacking the Co1 ligand did not, which demonstrated the efficient targeting of this antigenic protein through the mucosal-specific ligand."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2075,"details":{"paperId":"90c17062472afa0de07a3711ef252aa55ce824af","externalIds":{"MAG":"1976651066","DOI":"10.1016/J.PEP.2006.11.009","CorpusId":"28966357","PubMed":"17189703"},"title":"Expression and purification of a two-component flaviviral proteinase resistant to autocleavage at the NS2B-NS3 junction region.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A covalently linked, single-chain, NS2B-NS3pro K48A mutant construct that exhibits high stability and functional activity and is thus well suited for the follow-up purification and structural and drug design studies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2081,"details":{"paperId":"f7766321632529bb5ee0cccadc9867d975fc22b7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2003325267","DOI":"10.1016/j.pep.2013.01.009","CorpusId":"23890174","PubMed":"23376461"},"title":"Expression and purification of an immunogenic dengue virus epitope using a synthetic consensus sequence of envelope domain III and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Upon administration of the purified protein to mice, mouse sera contained antibodies that were specific to all four serotypes of dengue virus, suggesting that it may be possible to develop an effective tetravalent d Dengue vaccine using S. cerevisiae."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":356,"details":{"paperId":"961241ba4deca310465165185b8c572b49c75285","externalIds":{"MAG":"74878973","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-62703-484-5_19","CorpusId":"46416252","PubMed":"23821273"},"title":"Expression and purification of dengue virus NS5 polymerase and development of a high-throughput enzymatic assay for screening inhibitors of dengue polymerase.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The methods to express and purify the dengue NS5 polymerase from E. coli are described and a validated high-throughput enzymatic assay for screening inhibitors of NS 5 polymerase is developed for screening compounds for identifying polymerase inhibitors against DENV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8560,"details":{"paperId":"49f4f13244195bb375bc0e326f03806f31d2002e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2153026623","DOI":"10.5010/JPB.2014.41.1.50","CorpusId":"58899302"},"title":"Expression of Dengue virus EIII domain-coding gene in maize as an edible vaccine candidate","abstract":"Plant-based vaccines possess some advantages over other types of vaccine biotechnology such as safety, low cost of mass vaccination programs, and wider use of vaccines for medicine.

Celgosivir was given as a 400 mg loading dose and 200 mg bid (twice a day) over 5 days. Replication competent virus was measured by plaque assay and compared to reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qPCR) of viral RNA. Pharmacokinetics (PK) correlations with viremia, immunological profiling, next generation sequence (NGS) analysis and hematological data were evaluated as exploratory endpoints here to identify possible signals of pharmacological activity. Viremia by plaque assay strongly correlated with qPCR during the first four days. Immunological profiling demonstrated a qualitative shift in T helper cell profile during the course of infection. NGS analysis did not reveal any prominent signature that could be associated with drug treatment; however the phylogenetic spread of patients’ isolates underlines the importance of strain variability that may potentially confound interpretation of dengue drug trials conducted during different outbreaks and in different countries. Celgosivir rapidly converted to castanospermine (Cast) with mean peak and trough concentrations of 5727 ng/mL (30.2 μM) and 430 ng/mL (2.3 μM), respectively and cleared with a half-life of 2.5 (± 0.6) hr. Mean viral log reduction between day 2 and 4 (VLR2-4) was significantly greater in secondary dengue than primary dengue (p = 0.002). VLR2-4 did not correlate with drug AUC but showed a trend of greater response with increasing Cmin.

Adding on, platelet‐activating factor receptor (PTAFR) gene, expressed in megakaryocytes is involved in platelet aggregation.[5] The RNA extracted from the blood of the patients who were administered the extract showed a 15‐fold increase in the ALOX 12 gene activity. This gene is platelet‐specific and is a direct target of transcription factor RUNX1 in megakaryocytes and platelets.[5] As reported, there was a 13.42‐fold increased expression of the PTAFR gene among the patients who were given the extract orally as compared to the control group substantiating the role of papaya extract in platelet aggregation.[5] It has been noted that two components of a viral serine protease, NS2B and NS3, play a pivotal role in viral replication. It is crucial for the production of the polyprotein precursor before the assembly of the viral complex.[6] Researchers screened the flavonoid components of papaya leaves and concluded that quercetin has significant inhibitory activity against NS2B‐NS3 serine protease, particularly against Dengue virus serotype 2 and exerts its antiviral property by preventing viral assembly.[6] The major hurdle in using these leaves for treatment, is the dearth of substantial and consistent findings. Concrete evidence is still lacking as significant number of studies were done on patients solely based on the symptoms alone.[4] As on date, a study in Malaysia and a pilot study in Bengaluru, India were found to have a systematic approach in evaluating the effect of the leaf extract.[1,4] Although capsules of the extract are currently marketed in India[1] the mode of preparation, pharmacokinetic properties and the absorption of the active ingredient are still grey areas to be addressed.[4] Hopefully in future, this can be meted out by conducting large‐scale studies in DF confirmed human subjects in a tertiary hospital set up, standardizing the dosage and period of the intervention.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It has been noted that two components of a viral serine protease, NS2B and NS3, play a pivotal role in viral replication."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5705,"details":{"paperId":"e98e51d49c46738560e02f4491bafa8cf1751d5e","externalIds":{"MAG":"2149277978","PubMedCentral":"3655864","DOI":"10.1186/1472-6882-13-91","CorpusId":"10865032","PubMed":"23627436"},"title":"Extract of Scutellaria baicalensis inhibits dengue virus replication","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The study demonstrates the in vitro anti-dengue virus replication property of S. baicalensis against all the four DENV serotypes investigated, and the extract was rich in baicalein, and could be considered for potential development of anti-DENV therapeutics."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4392,"details":{"paperId":"70c02dac6ec7e7164c247286b3a10b4b849468ca","externalIds":{"MAG":"2886127051","DOI":"10.1101/382747","CorpusId":"196671518"},"title":"Ezetimibe inhibits Dengue virus infection in Huh-7 cells by blocking the cholesterol transporter Niemann–Pick C1-like 1 receptor","abstract":"Despite the importance of Dengue virus (DENV) infection in human health, there is not a fully effective vaccine or antiviral treatment against the infection.

To further test fitness and stability, we introgressed the Carb109M transgene into a genetically diverse laboratory strain (GDLS) by backcrossing for five generations and selecting individuals expressing the transgene's EGFP marker in each generation. Comparison of transgene stability in replicate backcross 5 (BC5) lines versus BC1 control lines demonstrated that backcrossing dramatically increased transgene stability. We subjected six BC5 lines to five generations of selection based on EGFP marker expression to increase the frequency of the transgene prior to final family selection. Comparison of the observed transgene frequencies in the six replicate lines relative to expectations from Fisher's selection model demonstrated lingering fitness costs associated with either the transgene or linked deleterious genes. Although minimal fitness loss (relative to GDLS) was manifest in the final family selection stage, we were able to select homozygotes for the transgene in one family, Carb109M/GDLS.BC5.HZ. This family has been genetically stable and DENV2 refractory for multiple generations. Carb109M/GDLS.BC5.HZ represents an important line for testing proof-of-principle vector population replacement.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Although minimal fitness loss was manifest in the final family selection stage, the authors were able to select homozygotes for the transgene in one family, Carb109M/GDLS, which has been genetically stable and refractory to DENV2 for >33 generations."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8620,"details":{"paperId":"0ee3b8106e74de7ab6048517d40cd2fba3902823","externalIds":{"MAG":"1556435192","DOI":"10.5772/21845","CorpusId":"30166770"},"title":"Flaviviral Infections and Potential Targets for Antiviral Therapy","abstract":"The family Flaviviridae includes human and animal pathogenic viruses of global importance, e.g. the human flaviviruses West-Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and yellow fever virus (JEV) as well as hepacivirus hepatitis C virus (HCV). This virus family was named after the jaundice occurring in course of YFV infection, the first identified virus of the Flaviviridae (Monath, 1987; Halstead, 1992). In humans infections with Flaviviridae may lead to fulminant, hemorrhagic diseaes [YFV, DENV and omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV)], viral encephalitis [JEV, TBEV, WNV, St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV)] or chronic hepatitis C, formerly referred to as non-A, non-B hepatitis (HCV) (Monath & Heinz, 1996; Rice, 1996). Viruses belonging to the third genus, pestivirus, infect only animals, leading to severe disease of the host, usually followed by death [bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and border disease virus (BDV)] (Nettelton & Entrican, 1995). The genus flavivirus consists of more than 70 species that are, on the basis of phylogenetic analyses, divided into 14 classes which in turn are grouped into three clusters: the mosquitoborne cluster, the tick-borne cluster and the non-vector cluster. All flaviviruses of human importance are mosquitoor tick-borne viruses. They enter through the skin by the bite of an infected arthropod, proliferating locally and spreading through the blood circulation and cross the blood-brain barrier and finally entering the central nervous system. This fact is important for further pathogenesis and unfavorable clinical outcome of the infection (King et al., 2007). Most pathogenic flaviviruses are associated with neurological diseases. The mosquito-borne encephalitic flaviviruses are grouped phylogenetically in the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex. Most tick-borne flaviviruses cause encephalitis and are mainly spread through Europe and Asia. Approximately up to 200 million new cases of infections caused by viruses of the Flaviviridae family are registered annually. Up to date, there is no effective antiviral therapy directed against Flaviviridae viruses. Members of the family of Flaviviridae are small (40 to 50 nm), spheric, enveloped RNA viruses of similar structure. The genome of the viruses consists of one single-stranded, positive-sense RNA with a length of 9100 to 11000 bases [e.g. 10862 for YFV (strain 17D), 10477 for Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus (RSSEV) and approx. 9100 for HCV].","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The family Flaviviridae includes human and animal pathogenic viruses of global importance, e.g. the human flaviviruses West-Nile virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalopathy virus and yellow fever virus as well as hepacivirus hepatitis C virus (HCV), which was named after the jaundice occurring in course of YFV infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":194,"details":{"paperId":"a67bf3026c7a1014ab9d7d721cbb583c1c305778","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4864441","MAG":"1483762054","DOI":"10.1002/rmv.1835","CorpusId":"13250001","PubMed":"25828437"},"title":"Flaviviral NS4b, chameleon and jack‐in‐the‐box roles in viral replication and pathogenesis, and a molecular target for antiviral intervention","abstract":"Dengue virus and other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses are emerging vector‐borne human pathogens that affect annually more than 100 million individuals and that may cause debilitating and potentially fatal hemorrhagic and encephalitic diseases.

The development of new vaccines is of vital importance, but the stringent need for safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness together with the problems associated with the specific immune pathogenesis of some flavivirus infections impose significant challenges to innovative vaccine research. Using tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) as a model, the viral capsid protein gene was recently identified as a novel target for generating flavivirus vaccines. This approach can be applied to produce either attenuated strains that can serve as live vaccines or to make a new type of a genetic vaccine consisting of non-infectious RNA replicons from which subviral particles are synthesized in vivo. Flaviviruses are small, enveloped viruses with an unsegmented positive-stranded RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein that is cleaved into the individual viral proteins. The specific introduction of various deletions and other mutations into the genomic segment coding for the capsid protein C and the biochemical and immunological characterization of the resulting mutants in cell culture and an animal model have revealed remarkable properties of this building block of the nucleocapsid and yielded information that opened the way for new vaccine approaches. In this review the in vitro and in vivo findings with various capsid deletion mutants of TBEV are summarized and discussed in the context of recent structural and biochemical data obtained for protein C of various flaviviruses. Potential benefits of this new strategy for generating flavivirus vaccines as well as hurdles that still have to be overcome are discussed in comparison to conventional or other experimental approaches.

In some cases, these ASCs represent more than 50% of the circulating B cells, a higher magnitude than those induced by other infections, vaccinations, and plasma cell lymphomas. However, it remains unclear how the DENV infection elicits this colossal response. To address this issue, we utilised an in vitro strategy to induce human PBMCs of healthy individuals incubated with DENV particles (DENV4 TVP/360) to differentiate into ASCs. As controls, PBMCs were incubated with a mitogen cocktail or supernatants of uninfected C6/36 cells (mock). The ASC phenotype and function were increasingly detected in the DENV and mitogen-cultured PBMCs as compared to mock-treated cells. In contrast to the in vivo condition, secreted IgG derived from the PBMC-DENV culture was not DENV-specific. Lower ASC numbers were observed when inactivated viral particles or purified B cells were added to the cultures. The physical contact was essential between B cells and the remaining PBMCs for the DENV-mediated ASC response. Considering the evidence for the activation of the tryptophan metabolism detected in the serum of Dengue patients, we assessed its relevance in the DENV-mediated ASC differentiation. For this, tryptophan and its respective metabolites were quantified in the supernatants of cell cultures through mass spectrophotometry. Tryptophan depletion and kynurenine accumulation were found in the supernatants of PBMC-DENV cultures, which presented enhanced detection of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 and 2 transcripts as compared to controls. In PBMC-DENV cultures, tryptophan and kynurenine levels strongly correlated to the respective ASC numbers, while the kynurenine levels were directly proportional to the secreted IgG titers. Contrastingly, PBMCs incubated with Zika or attenuated Yellow Fever viruses showed no correlation between their kynurenine concentrations and ASC numbers. Therefore, our data revealed the existence of distinct pathways for the DENV-mediated ASC differentiation and suggest the involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in this cellular process triggered by flavivirus infections.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An in vitro strategy to induce human PBMCs of healthy individuals incubated with DENV particles to differentiate into ASCs revealed the existence of distinct pathways for the DENV-mediated ASC differentiation and suggest the involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in this cellular process triggered by flavivirus infections."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4106,"details":{"paperId":"00c8a0947e04e2287e1b2a7f2e41ff783e151d3b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2124028633","DOI":"10.1099/0022-1317-76-9-2243","CorpusId":"15040835","PubMed":"7561761"},"title":"Flavivirus-cross-reactive, HLA-DR15-restricted epitope on NS3 recognized by human CD4+ CD8- cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones.","abstract":"The role of flavivirus-cross-reactive T lymphocytes in recovery from and pathogenesis of flavivirus infections is not known.

This demonstrated the individual variation in antibody responses. Most sera had detectable titres against LIV and some had titres against WNV and DENV-2. Generally, LIV titres were similar to titres against TBEV, confirming the close antigenic relationship between TBEV and LIV. JEV was also antigenically closer to TBEV than WNV, using these sera.

As a positive-strand RNA virus, dengue virus relies on the host cell metabolism for its translation, replication, and egress. Therefore, a better understanding of the host cell metabolic pathways required for dengue virus infection offers the opportunity to develop new approaches for therapeutic intervention. In a recently described screen of known drugs and bioactive molecules, we observed that methotrexate and floxuridine inhibited dengue virus infections at low micromolar concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that all serotypes of dengue virus, as well as West Nile virus, are highly sensitive to both methotrexate and floxuridine, whereas other RNA viruses (Sindbis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus) are not. Interestingly, flavivirus replication was restored by folinic acid, a thymidine precursor, in the presence of methotrexate and by thymidine in the presence of floxuridine, suggesting an unexpected role for thymidine in flavivirus replication. Since thymidine is not incorporated into RNA genomes, it is likely that increased thymidine production is indirectly involved in flavivirus replication. A possible mechanism is suggested by the finding that p53 inhibition restored dengue virus replication in the presence of floxuridine, consistent with thymidine-less stress triggering p53-mediated antiflavivirus effects in infected cells. Our data reveal thymidine synthesis pathways as new and unexpected therapeutic targets for antiflaviviral drug development.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data reveal thymidine synthesis pathways as new and unexpected therapeutic targets for antiflaviviral drug development and possible mechanism is suggested by the finding that p53 inhibition restored dengue virus replication in the presence of floxuridine."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2254,"details":{"paperId":"26a3142e202f3db7f63ca723bc9478347de05d13","externalIds":{"MAG":"2076145201","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.09.114","CorpusId":"21932895","PubMed":"22682286"},"title":"Flaviviruses and flavivirus vaccines.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Through the combination of structural and immunological investigations, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of virus neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infectivity at a molecular level is understood."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1798,"details":{"paperId":"1b64eca6f2c9ed148a8437746e994bb9b475b03c","externalIds":{"MAG":"2086577162","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcv.2012.08.024","CorpusId":"25821027","PubMed":"22999801"},"title":"Flaviviruses and their antigenic structure.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Details of the flavivirus particle structure have become available through the combined use of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy that led to novel and surprising insights into the antigenic structure of these viruses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1526,"details":{"paperId":"9e4973005794162b2be6ef3f5aaf78b058e613e7","externalIds":{"MAG":"2095247923","DOI":"10.1016/j.coviro.2012.12.001","CorpusId":"26913568","PubMed":"23352692"},"title":"Flaviviruses: braking the entering.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Understanding of the mechanism by which flavivirus E proteins orchestrate entry into cells has been advanced, and studies of E structure and arrangement on the virion at different steps of the virus entry/membrane fusion process suggest new antiviral strategies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4587,"details":{"paperId":"8d243f2bd9c0290b4a2b8a5d3088c58030aa646a","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7165549","MAG":"2114751852","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-065X.1996.tb00908.x","CorpusId":"19681765","PubMed":"8930665"},"title":"Flavivirus‐Induced Up‐regulation of MHC Class I Antigens; Implications for the Induction of CD8+ T‐Cell‐Mediated Autoimmunity","abstract":"Infection of a wide variety of cells of human, mouse and other species' origin by flaviviruses such as WNV, YF, Den, MVE, KUN and JE, increases the cell-surface expression of MHC class I. This MHC class I up-regulation is not due to increased MHC class I synthesis per se, but the result of increased peptide availability in the ER for MHC class I assembly. This is most likely due to the interaction of the viral polyprotein with the ER membrane during viral replication. Flavivirus infection can overcome peptide deficiency in TAP-deficient or non-permissive cell lines such as RMA-S and Syrian hamster cells, BHK and NIL-2. The consequence of this increased MHC class I expression manifests itself in reduced susceptibility to NK cells and augmented lysis by Tc cells. In mice, long-term flavivirus-immune Tc cell memory formation is impaired, following the appearance of strong anti-self Tc cell reactivity observed in in vitro cultures from splenocytes of flavivirus-primed animals. We hypothesize that flavivirus-induced MHC class I up-regulation leads to transient T-cell autoimmunity, followed by down-regulation of both autoimmunity and virus-specific Tc cell memory.

Here, we evaluated the inhibitory activity of 81 new mouse anti-DENV-4 MAbs. We observed strain- and genotype-dependent differences in neutralization of DENV-4 by MAbs mapping to epitopes on domain II (DII) and DIII of the envelope (E) protein. Several anti-DENV-4 MAbs inefficiently inhibited at least one strain and/or genotype, suggesting that the exposure or sequence of neutralizing epitopes varies within isolates of this serotype. Remarkably, flavivirus cross-reactive MAbs, which bound to the highly conserved fusion loop in DII and inhibited infection of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, more weakly neutralized five different DENV-4 strains encompassing the genetic diversity of the serotype after preincubation at 37°C. However, increasing the time of preincubation at 37°C or raising the temperature to 40°C enhanced the potency of DII fusion loop-specific MAbs and some DIII-specific MAbs against DENV-4 strains. Prophylaxis studies in two new DENV-4 mouse models showed that neutralization titers of MAbs after preincubation at 37°C correlated with activity in vivo.

It is the target of specific neutralizing antibodies, and is considered to be a promising subunit dengue vaccine candidate. However, several recent studies have shown that anti‑EDIII antibodies contribute little to the neutralizing or enhancing ability of human DENV‑infected serum. The present study involved an analysis of the neutralization and antibody‑dependent enhancement (ADE) activities of EDIII‑reactive antibodies in human convalescent sera from patients with primary DENV‑1 infection and rabbit antiserum immunized with recombinant DENV‑1 EDIII protein. The results indicated that serum neutralization was not associated with titres of EDIII‑binding antibodies in the human DENV‑1‑infected sera. The depletion of anti‑EDIII antibodies from these serum samples revealed that the anti‑EDIII antibodies of the patients contributed little to neutralization and ADE.

This study presents a new strategy for inexpensive production of anti-DENV peptide-fusion protein to prevent and/or treat DENV infection. Antiviral cationic peptides protegrin-1 (PG1) and plectasin (PLSN) were fused with MAP30 protein to produce recombinant antiviral peptide-fusion protein (PG1-MAP30-PLSN) as inclusion bodies in E. coli. High yield production of PG1-MAP30-PLSN protein was achieved by solubilization of inclusion bodies in alkaline buffer followed by the application of appropriate refolding techniques. Antiviral PG1-MAP30-PLSN protein considerably inhibited DENV protease (NS2B-NS3pro) with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 0.5±0.1 μM. The real-time proliferation assay (RTCA) and the end-point proliferation assay (MTT assay) showed that the maximal-nontoxic dose of the peptide-fusion protein against Vero cells is approximately 0.67±0.2 μM. The cell-based assays showed considerable inhibition of the peptide-fusion protein against binding and proliferating stages of DENV2 into the target cells. The peptide-fusion protein protected DENV2-challeged mice with 100% of survival at the dose of 50 mg/kg.

Most severe cases occur among patients secondarily infected with a different dengue virus (DENV) serotype compared with that from the first infection, resulting in antibody-dependent enhancement activity (ADE). Our previous study generated the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, D23-1B3B9 (B3B9), targeting the first domain II of E protein, which showed strong neutralizing activity (NT) against all four DENV serotypes. However, at sub-neutralizing concentrations, it showed ADE activity in vitro. Methods In this study, we constructed a new expression plasmid using the existing IgG heavy chain plasmid as a template for Fc modification at position N297Q by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting plasmid was then co-transfected with a light chain plasmid to produce full recombinant IgG (rIgG) in mammalian cells (N297Q-B3B9). This rIgG was characterized for neutralizing and enhancing activity by using different FcγR bearing cells. To produce sufficient quantities of B3B9 rIgG for further characterization, CHO-K1 cells stably secreting N297Q-B3B9 rIgG were then established. Results The generated N297Q-B3B9 rIgG which targets the conserved N-terminal fusion loop of DENV envelope protein showed the same cross-neutralizing activity to all four DENV serotypes as those of wild type rIgG. In both FcγRI- and RII-bearing THP-1 cells and FcγRII-bearing K562 cells, N297Q-B3B9 rIgG lacked ADE activity against all DENV serotypes at sub-neutralizing concentrations. Fortunately, the N297Q-B3B9 rIgG secreted from stable cells showed the same patterns of NT and ADE activities as those of the N297Q-B3B9 rIgG obtained from transient expression against DENV2. Thus, the CHO-K1 stably expressing N297Q-B3B9 HuMAb can be developed as high producer stable cells and used to produce sufficient amounts of antibody for further characterization as a promising dengue therapeutic candidate.

Methodology/Principal Findings After deriving vaccine viruses from RNA-transfected Vero cells, six plaque-purified viruses for each serotype were produced. The plaque-purified strains were then analyzed to select one stock for generation of the master seed. Full genetic and phenotypic characterizations of the master virus seeds were conducted to ensure these viruses retained the previously identified attenuating determinants and phenotypes of the vaccine viruses. We also assessed vector competence of the vaccine viruses in sympatric (Thai) Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors. Conclusion/Significance All four serotypes of master vaccine seeds retained the previously defined safety features, including all three major genetic loci of attenuation, small plaques, temperature sensitivity in mammalian cells, reduced replication in mosquito cell cultures, and reduced neurovirulence in new-born mice. In addition, the candidate vaccine viruses demonstrated greatly reduced infection and dissemination in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and are not likely to be transmissible by these mosquitoes.

Currently, there is no approved vaccine or therapy to prevent infection or diminish disease severity. Protection against DENV is associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies that recognize the viral envelope (E) protein. Here, with the goal of identifying monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that can function as postexposure therapy, we generated a panel of 82 new MAbs against DENV-3, including 24 highly neutralizing MAbs. Using yeast surface display, we localized the epitopes of the most strongly neutralizing MAbs to the lateral ridge of domain III (DIII) of the DENV type 3 (DENV-3) E protein. While several MAbs functioned prophylactically to prevent DENV-3-induced lethality in a stringent intracranial-challenge model of mice, only three MAbs exhibited therapeutic activity against a homologous strain when administered 2 days after infection. Remarkably, no MAb in our panel protected prophylactically against challenge by a strain from a heterologous DENV-3 genotype. Consistent with this, no single MAb neutralized efficiently the nine different DENV-3 strains used in this study, likely because of the sequence variation in DIII within and between genotypes. Our studies suggest that strain diversity may limit the efficacy of MAb therapy or tetravalent vaccines against DENV, as neutralization potency generally correlated with a narrowed genotype specificity.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"While several MAbs functioned prophylactically to prevent DENV-3-induced lethality in a stringent intracranial-challenge model of mice, only three MAbs exhibited therapeutic activity against a homologous strain when administered 2 days after infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5892,"details":{"paperId":"2e4206f9117b1b77ab6fba622df13ff053323887","externalIds":{"MAG":"2794526618","PubMedCentral":"5870686","DOI":"10.1186/s12985-018-0967-x","CorpusId":"4330849","PubMed":"29587780"},"title":"Genotype-specific and cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies induced by dengue virus infection: detection of antibodies with different levels of neutralizing activities against homologous and heterologous genotypes of dengue virus type 2 in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that different levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced against variable dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) genotypes after primary, secondary and tertiary infections, and that neutralizing antibody titers to some heterologous genotypes were higher than those to homologousgenotypes within a serotype."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5351,"details":{"paperId":"6e2de78726e6508cbf0dad472029f193db117754","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4631804","MAG":"2172901707","DOI":"10.1128/mBio.01559-15","CorpusId":"14698195","PubMed":"26530385"},"title":"Genotypic Differences in Dengue Virus Neutralization Are Explained by a Single Amino Acid Mutation That Modulates Virus Breathing","abstract":"ABSTRACT Flaviviruses sample an ensemble of virion conformations resulting from the conformational flexibility of their structural proteins. To investigate how sequence variation among strains impacts virus breathing, we performed studies with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) E111, which binds an inaccessible domain III envelope (E) protein epitope of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1). Prior studies indicated that an observed ~200-fold difference in neutralization between the DENV1 strains Western Pacific-74 (West Pac-74) and 16007 could not be explained by differences in the affinity of MAb E111 for each strain. Through neutralization studies with wild-type and variant viruses carrying genes encoding reciprocal mutations at all 13 amino acid differences between the E proteins of West Pac-74 and 16007, we found that E111 neutralization susceptibility mapped solely to the presence of a lysine or arginine at E domain II residue 204, located distally from the E111 epitope. This same residue correlated with neutralization differences observed for MAbs specific for epitopes distinct from E111, suggesting that this amino acid dictates changes in the conformational ensembles sampled by the virus. Furthermore, an observed twofold difference in the stability of infectious West Pac-74 versus 16007 in solution also mapped to E residue 204. Our results demonstrate that neutralization susceptibility can be altered in an epitope-independent manner by natural strain variation that influences the structures sampled by DENV. That different conformational ensembles of flaviviruses may affect the landscape available for antibody binding, as well as virus stability, has important implications for functional studies of antibody potency, a critical aspect of vaccine development. IMPORTANCE The global burden of dengue virus (DENV) is growing, with recent estimates of ~390 million human infections each year. Antibodies play a crucial role in protection from DENV infection, and vaccines that elicit a robust antibody response are being actively pursued. We report here the identification of a single amino acid residue in the envelope protein of DENV serotype 1 that results in global changes to virus structure and stability when it is changed. Our results indicate that naturally occurring variation at this particular site among virus strains impacts the ensemble of structures sampled by the virus, a process referred to as virus breathing. The finding that such limited and conservative sequence changes can modulate the landscape available for antibody binding has important implications for both vaccine development and the study of DENV-reactive antibodies.

Among the GL conjugates tested, compound hits GL-D-ValOMe 3, GL-TyrOMe 6, GL-PheOEt 11, and GL-LysOMe 21 were discovered to have better antiviral activity than GL, with IC50 values ranging from <0.1 to 5.98 μM on the in vitro infectivity of DENV1 and DENV2 in Vero E6 and A549 cells. Compound hits 3, 6, 11, and 21 had a concentration-dependent inhibition on the virus yield in Vero E6, in which GL-D-ValOMe 3 and GL-PheOEt 11 were the most active inhibitors of DENV2 yield. Meanwhile, the time-of-addition assay indicated that conjugates GL-D-ValOMe 3 and GL-PheOEt 11 exhibited a substantial decrease in the DENV2 attachment stage. Subsequently, chimeric single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) of DENV2 C-prM-E protein/JEV replicon and DENV2 prM-E/ZIKV replicon were utilized for the DENV envelope I protein-mediated attachment assay. GL conjugates 3 and 11 significantly reduced the attachment of chimeric DENV2 C-prM-E/JEV and DENV2 prM-E/ZIKV SRIPs onto Vero E6 cells in a concentration-dependent manner but did not impede the attachment of wild-type JEV CprME/JEV and ZIKV prM-E/ZIKV SRIPs, indicating the inhibition of Compounds 3 and 11 on DENV2 E-mediated attachment. Molecular docking data revealed that Compounds 3 and 11 have hydrophobic interactions within a hydrophobic pocket among the interfaces of Domains I, II, and the stem region of the DENV2 envelope (E) protein. These results displayed that Compounds 3 and 11 were the lead compounds targeting the DENV E protein.

Currently, there are still no promising therapeutics to alleviate the dengue‐associated vascular hemorrhage in a clinical setting. In the present study, we first observed that heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1) expression level was highly suppressed in severe DENV‐infected patients. In contrast, the overexpression of HO‐1 could attenuate DENV‐induced pathogenesis, including plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia, in an AG129 mouse model. Our data indicate that overexpression of HO‐1 or its metabolite biliverdin can maintain endothelial integrity upon DENV infection in vitro and in vivo.

Previous studies of human dengue-immune sera reported that a significant proportion of anti-E Abs, known as group-reactive (GR) Abs, were cross-reactive to all four DENV serotypes and to one or more other flaviviruses. Based on studies of mouse anti-E monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), GR MAbs were nonneutralizing or weakly neutralizing compared with type-specific MAbs; a GR response was thus not regarded as important for vaccine strategy. We investigated the epitopes, binding avidities, and neutralization potencies of 32 human GR anti-E MAbs. In addition to fusion loop (FL) residues in E protein domain II, human GR MAbs recognized an epitope involving both FL and bc loop residues in domain II. The neutralization potencies and binding avidities of GR MAbs derived from secondary DENV infection were stronger than those derived from primary infection. GR MAbs derived from primary DENV infection primarily blocked attachment, whereas those derived from secondary infection blocked DENV postattachment. Analysis of the repertoire of anti-E MAbs derived from patients with primary DENV infection revealed that the majority were GR, low-avidity, and weakly neutralizing MAbs, whereas those from secondary infection were primarily GR, high-avidity, and potently neutralizing MAbs. Our findings suggest that the weakly neutralizing GR anti-E Abs generated from primary DENV infection become potently neutralizing MAbs against the four serotypes after secondary infection. The observation that the dengue immune status of the host affects the quality of the cross-reactive Abs generated has implications for new strategies for DENV vaccination.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The findings suggest that the weakly neutralizing GR anti-E Abs generated from primary DENV infection become potently neutralizing MAbs against the four serotypes after secondary infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3713,"details":{"paperId":"2e47dfb2c283cf1e61bcd20a4308aac57a7ddff0","externalIds":{"MAG":"2003470307","DOI":"10.1089/adt.2010.0321","CorpusId":"23224396","PubMed":"20973722"},"title":"High-content assay to identify inhibitors of dengue virus infection.","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) infections are vectored by mosquitoes and constitute one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in many parts of the world, affecting millions of people annually.

In this study, we describe the adaptation of a high-content cell-based assay for screening against DENV-infected cells to identify inhibitors and modulators of DENV infection. Using this high-content approach, we monitored the inhibition of test compounds on DENV protein production by means of immunofluorescence staining of DENV glycoprotein envelope, simultaneously evaluating cytotoxicity in HEK293 cells. The adapted 384-well microtiter-based assay was validated using a small panel of compounds previously reported as having inhibitory activity against DENV infections of cell cultures, including compounds with antiviral activity (ribavirin), inhibitors of cellular signaling pathways (U0126), and polysaccharides that are presumed to interfere with virus attachment (carrageenan).

The study identified 22 human DENV/WNV resistance genes (DVR), and we hypothesized that a subset would be functionally conserved in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, imparting cellular defense against flaviviruses in this species. We identified 12 homologs of 22 human DVR genes in the Ae. aegypti genome. To evaluate their possible role in cellular resistance/antiviral defense against DENV, we used siRNA silencing targeted against each of the 12 homologs in an Ae. aegypti cell line (Aag2) infected with DENV2 and identified that silencing of the two candidates, AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY, homologs of human FKBP1B and ATCAY, were associated with a viral increase. We then used dsRNA to silence each of the two genes in adult mosquitoes to validate the observed antiviral functions in vivo. Depletion of AeFKBP1 or AeATCAY increased viral dissemination through the mosquito at 14 days post-infection. Our results demonstrated that AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY mediate resistance to DENV akin to what has been described for their homologs in humans. AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY provide a rare opportunity to elucidate a DENV-resistance mechanism that may be evolutionarily conserved between humans and Ae. aegypti.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results demonstrated that AeFKBP1 and AeATCAY mediate resistance to DENV akin to what has been described for their homologs in humans, providing a rare opportunity to elucidate a DENV-resistance mechanism that may be evolutionarily conserved between humans and Ae."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":92,"details":{"paperId":"8c6918181c6e3e534e5791f1bec7a975dd9efd20","externalIds":{"MAG":"2101706577","DOI":"10.1002/jmr.977","CorpusId":"45663849","PubMed":"19693793"},"title":"Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of Dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease: insight into molecular interaction","abstract":"The pathogenic West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus (DV) are growing global threats for which there are no specific treatments. Both viruses possess a two component NS2B/NS3 protease which cleaves viral precursor proteins. Whereas for the WNV protease two crystal structures in complex with an inhibitor have been solved recently, no such information is available for the DV protease. Here, we report the generation of a homology model of DV NS2B/NS3 protease. Since it is known from the related WNV protease that it adopts a distinct conformation in free and in inhibitor‐complexed form, a special emphasis was given to the analysis of the protease flexibility. Therefore, several models of DV NS2B/NS3 protease complexed with the peptidic inhibitor (Bz‐Nle(P4)‐Lys(P3)‐Arg(P2)‐Arg(P1)‐H) were generated. The first DV protease model (DV‐1) was constructed using the available crystal structure of the apo DV NS2B/NS3 protease. The second model (DV‐2) was built taking the WNV NS3/NS2B protease in the inhibitor‐complexed form as the template structure. Molecular dynamics simulations which were carried out for the WNV crystal structures as well as for the DV models provided an understanding of the role of NS2B for maintaining the protease in the active conformation. It was also demonstrated that NS2B is not only important for maintaining NS3 in the active form, but is also essential for establishing the interaction between residues from the S2 pocket and the peptidic inhibitor.

We previously demonstrated that CD8+ T cell responses elicited by a dengue live attenuated virus (DLAV) vaccine resemble those observed after natural infection. In this study, we screened peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors vaccinated with a tetravalent DLAV vaccine (TV005) with pools of dengue virus-derived predicted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II binding peptides. The definition of CD4+ T cell responses after live vaccination is important because CD4+ T cells are known contributors to host immunity, including cytokine production, help for CD8+ T and B cells, and direct cytotoxicity against infected cells. While responses to all antigens were observed, DENV-specific CD4+ T cells were focused predominantly on the capsid and nonstructural NS3 and NS5 antigens. Importantly, CD4+ T cell responses in vaccinees were similar in magnitude and breadth to those after natural infection, recognized the same antigen hierarchy, and had similar profiles of HLA restriction. We conclude that TV005 vaccination has the capacity to elicit CD4+ cell responses closely mirroring those observed in a population associated with natural immunity. IMPORTANCE The development of effective vaccination strategies against dengue virus infection is of high global public health interest. Here we study the CD4 T cell responses elicited by a tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine and show that they resemble responses seen in humans naturally exposed to dengue virus. This is an important issue, since it is likely that optimal immunity induced by a vaccine requires induction of CD4+ responses against the same antigens as those recognized as dominant in natural infection.

The infection remains asymptomatic in most cases but can cause severe neurological disorders. ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that emerged in the Pacific islands in 2007 and spread to the Americas in 2015. The infection remains asymptomatic in most cases but can be associated with severe neurological disorders. Despite massive efforts, no specific drug or vaccine against ZIKV infection is available to date. Claudins are tight-junction proteins that favor the entry of several flaviviruses, including ZIKV. In this study, we identified two peptides derived from the N-terminal sequences of claudin-7 and claudin-1, named CL7.1 and CL1.1, respectively, that inhibited ZIKV infection in a panel of human cell lines. Using cell-to-cell fusion assays, we demonstrated that these peptides blocked the ZIKV E-mediated membrane fusion. A comparison of the antiviral efficacy of CL1.1 and CL7.1 pointed to the importance of the peptide amphipathicity. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that CL1.1 altered the ultrastructure of the viral particles likely by binding the virus lipid envelope. However, amphipathicity could not fully explain the antiviral activity of CL1.1. In silico docking simulations suggested that CL1.1 may also interact with the E protein, near its stem region. Overall, our data suggested that claudin-derived peptides inhibition may be linked to simultaneous interaction with the E protein and the viral lipid envelope. Finally, we found that CL1.1 also blocked infection by yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses but not by HIV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Our results provide a basis for the future development of therapeutics against a wide range of endemic and emerging flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquito bites that have spread to the Pacific Islands and the Americas over the past decade. The infection remains asymptomatic in most cases but can cause severe neurological disorders. ZIKV is a major public health threat in areas of endemicity, and there is currently no specific antiviral drug or vaccine available. We identified two antiviral peptides deriving from the N-terminal sequences of claudin-7 and claudin-1 with the latter being the most effective. These peptides block the envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Our data suggested that the inhibition was likely achieved by simultaneously interacting with the viral lipid envelope and the E protein.

Most human dengue target cells coexpress activating (FcγRIIa) and inhibitory (FcγRIIb) isoforms, but their relative roles in ADE are not well understood. We studied the effects of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb by transfecting cells to express each individual receptor isoform or through coexpression of both isoforms. We showed that although both isoforms similarly bind dengue-immune complexes, FcγRIIa efficiently internalized virus leading to productive cellular infection, unlike FcγRIIb. We next focused on the main discriminating feature of these isoforms: their distinct intracytoplasmic tails (FcγRIIa with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif [ITAM] and FcγRIIb with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif [ITIM]). We engineered cells to express “swapped” versions of their FcγRII by switching the cytoplasmic tails containing the ITAM/ITIM motifs, leaving the remainder of the receptor intact. Our data show that both FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb comparably bind dengue immune complexes. However, wild type FcγRIIa facilitates DENV entry by virtue of the ITAM motif, whereas the swapped version FcγRIIa-ITIM significantly inhibited ADE. Similarly, replacing the inhibitory motif in FcγRIIb with an ITAM (FcγRIIb-ITAM) reconstituted ADE capacity to levels of the wild type activating counterpart, FcγRIIa.

Thus far, there are no approved therapeutics or vaccine available. Current treatment of the disease is mainly supportive, e.g., bed rest and electrolyte replacement for relief of symptoms. DENV consists of four serotypes; DENV1 to DENV4. Infection with one serotype confers lifelong protection against the homologous serotype. However, the antibodies generated against this virus serotype may cause the development of a more severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever, if the host is infected with another serotype (2). This, in part, is due to the binding of weakly neutralizing serotype cross-reactive antibodies to the new DENV serotype. The antibody is unable to neutralize the virus; instead, it helps to concentrate the virus on the host macrophage cell surface by the binding of antibody to the macrophage Fc receptors, thereby causing enhanced infection. This complicates the development of a vaccine as it would need to stimulate strong neutralizing antibody response against all serotypes. Therefore, for the last few decades, there is a quest in identifying neutralizing epitopes for all serotypes. With the recent availability of technologies to generate dengue virus infectious clones and human monoclonal antibodies (HMAb), the identification of immuno-dominant neutralizing epitopes recognized by humans is made possible.

We show that both acute and convalescent dengue sera potently bind and neutralize ZIKV and that this cross-reactivity is also evident at the monoclonal level. We also demonstrate in vitro antibody-dependent enhancement of ZIKV infection in the presence of dengue-induced antibodies. Our findings strongly suggest that preexisting dengue antibodies may modulate immune responses to ZIKV infection. These data are timely and highly relevant from a public health standpoint given that a majority of regions currently experiencing Zika virus epidemics are endemic for dengue. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus of significant public health concern. ZIKV shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology compared with other flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), resulting in immunological cross-reactivity. Improving our current understanding of the extent and characteristics of this immunological cross-reactivity is important, as ZIKV is presently circulating in areas that are highly endemic for dengue. To assess the magnitude and functional quality of cross-reactive immune responses between these closely related viruses, we tested acute and convalescent sera from nine Thai patients with PCR-confirmed DENV infection against ZIKV. All of the sera tested were cross-reactive with ZIKV, both in binding and in neutralization. To deconstruct the observed serum cross-reactivity in depth, we also characterized a panel of DENV-specific plasmablast-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for activity against ZIKV. Nearly half of the 47 DENV-reactive mAbs studied bound to both whole ZIKV virion and ZIKV lysate, of which a subset also neutralized ZIKV. In addition, both sera and mAbs from the dengue-infected patients enhanced ZIKV infection of Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)-bearing cells in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest that preexisting immunity to DENV may impact protective immune responses against ZIKV.

In natural DENV2 infections, strongly neutralizing type-specific antibodies provide protection against subsequent DENV2 infection. While the epitopes of some human DENV2 type-specific antibodies have been mapped, it is not known if these are representative of the polyclonal antibody response. Using structure-guided immunogen design and reverse genetics, we generated a panel of recombinant viruses containing amino acid alterations and epitope transplants between different serotypes. Using this panel of recombinant viruses in binding, competition, and neutralization assays, we have finely mapped the epitopes of three human DENV2 type-specific monoclonal antibodies, finding shared and distinct epitope regions. Additionally, we used these recombinant viruses and polyclonal sera to dissect the epitope-specific responses following primary DENV2 natural infection and monovalent vaccination.

Here, we investigated the ability of small volume of hypertonic saline (HTS) suspensions to control vascular permeability in a mouse model of severe DEN associated with vascular leakage. Several HTS treatment regimens were considered and our results indicated that a single bolus of 7.5% NaCl at 4 mL per kg of body weight administered at the onset of detectable vascular leakage rapidly and significantly reduced vascular leak for several days after injection. This transient reduction of vascular leakage correlated with reduced intestine and liver damage with restoration of the hepatic functions, and resulted in delayed death of the infected animals. Mechanistically, we showed that HTS did not directly impact on the viral titers but resulted in lower immune cells counts and decreased systemic levels of soluble mediators involved in vascular permeability. In addition, we demonstrated that neutrophils do not play a critical role in DEN-associated vascular leakage and that the therapeutic effect of HTS is not mediated by its impact on the neutrophil counts.

Dengue vaccine development has been hampered by concerns that cross-reactive immunological memory elicited by a candidate vaccine could increase the risk of development of more severe clinical forms. One possible strategy to reduce risks associated with a dengue vaccine is the development of a vaccine composed of selected critical epitopes of each of the serotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings Synthetic peptides were used to identify B-cell epitopes in the envelope (E) glycoprotein of dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3). Eleven linear, immunodominant epitopes distributed in five regions at amino acid (aa) positions: 51–65, 71–90, 131–170, 196–210 and 246–260 were identified by employing an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a pool of human sera from dengue type 3 infected individuals. Peptides 11 (aa51–65), 27 and 28 (aa131–150) also reacted with dengue 1 (DENV-1) and dengue 2 (DENV-2) patient sera as analyzed through the ROC curves generated for each peptide by ELISA and might have serotype specific diagnostic potential.

Computational approaches can contribute offering tools that can shed light on important molecular mechanisms that help to design new diagnostic procedures. Several cellular processes between the immune-host system and the pathogenic organism are dependent on specific intermolecular interactions. In this study, we evaluated theoretical approaches to understand some properties of the antigen-antibody interactions considering the titratable properties of all ionizable residues of the non-structural viral protein 1 (NS1) of West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate electrostatic properties such as the pKa shifts (ΔpKa). We proposed an alternative criterion for the discrimination of antigenic residues based on ΔpKas. Our outcomes were analyzed by an evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC). As a starting point, we used the known crystallographic structure for the complex of NS1WNV(176-352) and the specific antibody 22NS1 (PDB id 4OII) to differentiate the residues belonging to that interface. With an optimal threshold for the absolute value of the pKa shifts, we found that is possible to predict antigenic epitopes reproducing the interfaces as defined by the X-ray structure. After this validation, we evaluated theoretical predictions based on protein-protein (PP) complexation simulations. From them, we observe amino acids with an antigenic potential and defined the optimum threshold that was applied for two strains of ZIKV (i.e., Uganda and Brazil). Several ionizable residues with antigenic capacity were identified. This is favorably related to some studies that show the high immunogenicity of secreted NS1.

To identify antiviral small molecules with well-characterized safety and bioavailability profiles, we screened a library of 2,907 approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds for inhibitors of ZIKV infection using a high-throughput cell-based immunofluorescence assay. Interestingly, estrogen receptor modulators raloxifene hydrochloride and quinestrol were among 15 compounds that significantly inhibited ZIKV infection in repeat screens. Subsequent validation studies revealed that these drugs effectively inhibit ZIKV, DENV, and WNV (Kunjin strain) infection at low micromolar concentrations with minimal cytotoxicity in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells and HTR-8 placental trophoblast cells. Since these cells lack detectable expression of estrogen receptors-α and -β (ER-α and ER-β) and similar antiviral effects were observed in the context of subgenomic DENV and ZIKV replicons, these compounds appear to inhibit viral RNA replication in a manner that is independent of their known effects on estrogen receptor signaling.

Here, we report the identification of a novel class of inhibitor (i.e., an active-site metal ion chelator) that acts against DENV RdRp activity. DENV RdRp utilizes a two-metal-ion mechanism of catalysis; therefore, we constructed a small library of compounds, through mechanism-based drug design, aimed at chelating divalent metal ions in the catalytic site of DENV RdRp. We now describe a pyridoxine-derived small-molecule inhibitor that targets DENV RdRp and show that 5-benzenesulfonylmethyl-3-hydroxy-4-hydroxymethyl-pyridine-2-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide (termed DMB220) inhibited the RdRp activity of DENV serotypes 1 to 4 at low micromolar 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s of 5 to 6.7 μM) in an enzymatic assay. The antiviral activity of DMB220 against DENV infection was also verified in a cell-based assay and showed a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of <3 μM. Enzyme assays proved that DMB220 was competitive with nucleotide incorporation. DMB220 did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and showed only weak inhibition of HIV-1 integrase strand transfer activity, indicating high specificity for DENV RdRp. S600T substitution in the DENV RdRp, which was previously shown to confer resistance to nucleoside analogue inhibitors (NI), conferred 3-fold hypersusceptibility to DMB220, and enzymatic analyses showed that this hypersusceptibility may arise from the decreased binding/incorporation efficiency of the natural NTP substrate without significantly impacting inhibitor binding.

The nonstructural protein, NS3, was immuno-dominant in the CD4+ T-cell response of this donor. The epitopes of four NS3-specific T-cell clones were analyzed. JK15 and JK13 recognized only DEN3 NS3, while JK44 recognized DEN1, DEN2, and DEN3 NS3 and JK5 recognized DEN1, DEN3, and West Nile virus NS3. The epitopes recognized by these clones on the DEN3 NS3 protein were localized with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing truncated regions of the NS3 gene, and then the minimal recognition sequence was mapped with synthetic peptides. Amino acids critical for T-cell recognition were assessed by using peptides with amino acid substitutions. One of the serotype-specific clones (JK13) and the subcomplex- and flavivirus-cross-reactive clone (JK5) recognized the same core epitope, WITDFVGKTVW. The amino acid at the sixth position of this epitope is critical for recognition by both clones. Sequence analysis of the T-cell receptors of these two clones showed that they utilize different VP chains. The core epitopes for the four HLA-DR15-restricted CD4+ CTL clones studied do not contain motifs similar to those proposed by previous studies on endogenous peptides eluted from HLA-DR15 molecules.

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is essential for dengue viral replication is chosen as a drug target for dengue drug discovery.

Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed that the dengue polymerase–lead complex is stable and their interactions are consistent throughout the simulation. The hydrogen-bonded interactions formed by the residues Arg792, Thr794, Ser796, and Asn405 are the primary contributors for the stability and the rigidity of the polymerase–lead complex.

Here, we demonstrate that the dengue virus (DENV)-specific serum Ab response in humans consists of a large fraction of cross-reactive, poorly neutralizing Abs and a small fraction of serotype-specific, potently inhibitory Abs. Although many mouse-generated, strongly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognize epitopes that are present on recombinant DENV envelope (E) proteins, unexpectedly, the majority of neutralizing Abs in human immune sera bound to intact virions but not to the ectodomain of purified soluble E proteins. These conclusions with polyclonal Abs were confirmed with newly generated human mAbs derived from DENV-immune individuals. Two of three strongly neutralizing human mAbs bound to E protein epitopes that were preserved on the virion but not on recombinant E (rE) protein. We propose that humans produce Abs that neutralize DENV infection by binding a complex, quaternary structure epitope that is expressed only when E proteins are assembled on a virus particle. Mapping studies indicate that this epitope has a footprint that spans adjacent E protein dimers and includes residues at the hinge between domains I and II of E protein.

Therefore, in this study, the NS1 protein was modeled in dimeric form which is predominantly present inside the host cell. The dimeric model was validated and it was glycosylated at ASN130 and ASN207 with oligomannose. This model was simulated for 100 ns to retrieve the global minima structure. The andrographolide and its four derivatives were docked non-specifically against the dimeric glycosylated NS1 protein. The neo-andrographolide compound showed strong interactions with favorable binding energy of -8.2 kcal/mol and electrostatic binding affinity of -8.9 kcal/mol. All docked ligand-protein complexes were simulated for 100 ns.

During initiation of viral RNA synthesis, the polymerase switches from a “closed” to “open” conformation to accommodate the viral RNA template. Inhibitors that lock the “closed” or block the “open” conformation would prevent viral RNA synthesis.

Liberated Atto fluorophore allows for quantification of RdRp activity via fluorescence. The second assay uses the same RNA template but is label free and directly detects RdRp-mediated liberation of pyrophosphates of native ribonucleotides via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The ability of inhibitors to bind and stabilize a “closed” conformation of the DENV RdRp was further assessed in a differential scanning fluorimetry assay.

However, iminosugars are glycomimetics possessing a nitrogen atom in place of the endocyclic oxygen atom, and the ubiquity of glycans in host metabolism suggests that multiple pathways can be targeted via iminosugar treatment. Successful treatment of patients with glycolipid processing defects using iminosugars highlights the clinical exploitation of iminosugar inhibition of enzymes other than ER α-glucosidases. Evidence correlating antiviral activity with successful inhibition of ER glucosidases together with the exclusion of alternative mechanisms of action of iminosugars in the context of DENV infection is limited. Celgosivir, a bicyclic iminosugar evaluated in phase Ib clinical trials as a therapeutic for the treatment of DENV infection, was confirmed to be antiviral in a lethal mouse model of antibody-enhanced DENV infection. In this study we provide the first evidence of the antiviral activity of celgosivir in primary human macrophages in vitro, in which it inhibits DENV secretion with an EC50 of 5 μM.

By comparison to bicyclic glucose-mimicking iminosugars which inhibit glycoprotein processing but do not inhibit glycolipid processing and galactose-mimicking iminosugars which do not inhibit glycoprotein processing but do inhibit glycolipid processing, we demonstrate that inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidases, not glycolipid processing, is responsible for iminosugar antiviral activity against DENV.

The ongoing COVID pandemic highlights the need to tackle viral variants and expand the number of antigens and assess diverse delivery systems. To address some of these key issues, we have created a Dengue DNA vaccine candidate with the EDIII region as the key antigen given the promise of this segment in not causing ADE, a challenge with this disease. In addition, we have added the NS1 region to broaden the immune response. Following a large Dengue viral sequencing exercise in India, complemented with data from east Africa, our approach was to generate a consensus of four serotypes ED3-NS1 vaccine to explore tackling the issue of diversity. Our In silico structural analysis of EDIII consensus vaccine sequence revealed that epitopes are structurally conserved and immunogenic across HLA diversity. Vaccination of mice with this construct induced pan-serotype neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cell responses.

Effects such as a general increase or decrease of the response as well as epitope-specific phenomena have been described. In this study, we investigated influences of IC immunization on the fine specificity of antibody responses in a structurally well-defined system, using the envelope (E) protein of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus as an immunogen. TBE virus occurs in Europe and Asia and—together with the yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses—represents one of the major human-pathogenic flaviviruses. Mice were immunized with a dimeric soluble form of E (sE) alone or in complex with monoclonal antibodies specific for each of the three domains of E, and the antibody response induced by these ICs was compared to that seen after immunization with sE alone. Immunoassays using recombinant domains and domain combinations of TBE virus sE as well as the distantly related West Nile virus sE allowed the dissection and quantification of antibody subsets present in postimmunization sera, thus generating fine-specificity patterns of the polyclonal responses. There were substantially different responses with two of the ICs, and the differences could be mechanistically related to (i) epitope shielding and (ii) antibody-mediated structural changes leading to dissociation of the sE dimer. The phenomena described may also be relevant for polyclonal responses upon secondary infections and/or booster immunizations and may affect antibody responses in an individual-specific way. IMPORTANCE Infections with flaviviruses such as yellow fever, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses pose substantial public health problems in different parts of the world. Antibodies to viral envelope protein E induced by natural infection or vaccination were shown to confer protection from disease. Such antibodies can target different epitopes in E protein, and the fine specificities of polyclonal responses can differ between individuals. We conducted a mouse immunization study with TBE E protein alone or complexed to monoclonal antibodies specific for each of the three protein domains. We demonstrated that phenomena such as epitope shielding and antibody-induced structural changes can profoundly influence the fine specificity of antibody responses to the same immunogen. The study thus provided important new information on the potential immunomodulatory role of preexisting antibodies in a flavivirus system that can be relevant for understanding individual-specific factors influencing antibody responses in sequential flavivirus infections and/or immunizations.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that phenomena such as epitope shielding and antibody-induced structural changes can profoundly influence the fine specificity of antibody responses to the same immunogen, providing important new information on the potential immunomodulatory role of preexisting antibodies in a flavivirus system."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7620,"details":{"paperId":"103281a582688b620ca3d1d012494e8311fbd42c","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9635855","DOI":"10.3389/fmolb.2022.935456","CorpusId":"253024609","PubMed":"36339720"},"title":"Immuno-dominant dengue NS1 peptides as antigens for production of monoclonal antibodies","abstract":"Synthetic peptides have recently become common as antigens for antibody production.

To empirically identify DENV-specific MHC ligands, we developed an immuno-proteomics approach for interrogating DENV- and self-derived MHC ligands from infected B-lymphocytes.

Second, we report 121 viral MHC-I ligands (108 novel) which clustered into discrete hotspots across the DENV polyprotein, some of which spanned DENV polyprotein components, described here as MHC ligands for the first time. Third, we found DENV ligands which were distinctly presented by MHC alleles previously associated with either high or low anti-DENV response. Fourth, we demonstrate that while our in vitro assay only overlapped with a small fraction of previously described DENV T-cell epitopes, several novel MHC ligands identified here were recognized by T-cells from DENV-infected patients despite having low binding affinities.

VaxInnate has developed a vaccine platform that genetically links vaccine antigens to bacterial flagellin, a Toll-like receptor 5 ligand. Here we report that tetravalent dengue vaccines (TDVs) consisting of four constructs, each containing two copies of EIII fused to flagellin (R3.2x format), elicited robust and long-lived neutralizing antibodies (geometric mean titers of 200 to 3,000), as measured with a 50% focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50). In an immunogenicity study, rhesus macaques (n = 2) immunized subcutaneously with 10 μg or 90 μg of TDV three or four times, at 4- to 6-week intervals, developed neutralizing antibodies to four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (mean post-dose 3 FRNT50 titers of 102 to 601). In an efficacy study, rhesus macaques (n = 4) were immunized intramuscularly with 16 μg or 48 μg of TDV or a placebo control three times, at 1-month intervals. The animals that received 48-μg doses of TDV developed neutralizing antibodies against the four serotypes (geometric mean titers of 49 to 258) and exhibited reduced viremia after DENV-2 challenge, with a group mean viremia duration of 1.25 days and 2 of 4 animals being completely protected, compared to the placebo-treated animals, which all developed viremia, with a mean duration of 4 days.

Both TDEN-PIV followed by TDEN-LAV groups demonstrated 100% tetravalent seroconversion 28 days following the booster dose which was maintained for most of these subjects through the day 180 measurement.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy for dengue merits additional evaluation for safety, immunogenicity, and potential for clinical benefit.(Trial Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02239614).","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy for dengue merits additional evaluation for safety, immunogenicity, and potential for clinical benefit."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6944,"details":{"paperId":"ea8fddd28c383ed7362822c14dd29862e5c5a126","externalIds":{"MAG":"3021754757","PubMedCentral":"6295631","DOI":"10.17179/excli2018-1664","CorpusId":"56171685","PubMed":"30564083"},"title":"Immunogenicity of a novel tetravalent dengue envelope protein domain III-based antigen in mice","abstract":"Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes dengue diseases.

A chimeric protein was designed from domain III of envelope protein of all serotypes of dengue virus. Four domain III fragments were linked together by alpha helix making linkers. The final sequence of the designed protein was analyzed in silico and the coding gene sequence was deduced by reverse translation. After cloning and expression of the recombinant protein (ED3-tetravalent protein), identity of the purified protein was confirmed using a pan-dengue specific monoclonal antibody in Western blotting. Then, the immunogenicity of the purified protein was studied in mice using antibody titration. The efficacy of induced antibodies in neutralization of the virus was studies by FRNT method. Furthermore, the induction of cellular immunity was studied by measurement of cytokines using ELISA method and measurement of lymphocyte proliferation using MTT assay.

Dengue virus infection induces transient immune aberrant activation of CD4/CD8 ratio inversion and cytokine overproduction, and infection of endothelial cells and hepatocytes causes apoptosis and dysfunction of these cells. The coagulation and fibrinolysis systems are also activated after dengue virus infection. We propose a new hypothesis for the immunopathogenesis for dengue virus infection.

Hemostasis is maintained unless the dysregulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis persists. The overproduced IL-6 might play a crucial role in the enhanced production of anti-platelet or anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies, elevated levels of tPA, as well as a deficiency in coagulation.

Docking of selected ligands, having anti- dengue activity with the active-site of protein 2FOM, was done to find the biochemical information. Docking interactions were interpreted in the form of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and ionic interactions.

Seven analogues of the lead compound were designed and docked with the active site of protein. Interactions of the analogues with the active site of 2FOM protein were analyzed.

Clinically-severe dengue disease is more common when secondary dengue infection occurs following prior infection with a heterologous dengue serotype. Other flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Zika virus, can also elicit antibodies which are cross-reactive to DENV. As candidate dengue vaccines become available in endemic settings and for individuals who have received other flavivirus vaccines, it is important to examine vaccine safety and immunogenicity in these flavivirus-experienced populations. We performed a randomized, controlled trial of the National Institutes of Health live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (TV003) in fifty-eight individuals with prior exposure to flavivirus infection or vaccine. As in prior studies of this vaccine in flavivirus-naive volunteers, flavivirus-experienced subjects received two doses of vaccine six months apart and were followed closely for clinical events, laboratory changes, viremia, and neutralizing antibody titers. TV003 was well tolerated with few adverse events other than rash, which was predominately mild. Following one dose, 87% of vaccinees had an antibody response to all four serotypes (tetravalent response), suggesting a robust immune response. In addition, 76% of vaccinees were viremic; mean peak titers ranged from 0.68–1.1 log10 PFU/mL and did not differ by serotype. The second dose of TV003 was not associated with viremia, rash, or a sustained boost in antibody titers indicating that a single dose of the vaccine is likely sufficient to prevent viral replication and thus protect against disease. In comparison to the viremia and neutralizing antibody response elicited by TV003 in flavivirus-naïve subjects from prior studies, we found that subjects who were flavivirus-exposed prior to vaccination exhibited slightly higher DENV-3 viremia, higher neutralizing antibody titers to DENV-2, -3, and -4, and a higher tetravalent response frequency after TV003 administration. In summary, we demonstrate that the NIH tetravalent dengue vaccine TV003 is well-tolerated in flavivirus-experienced individuals and elicits robust post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers.

In the search for active conformation of the EHB1-18, linear QSAR model was prepared, which correlated computed gas phase enthalpies of formation ∆∆HMM of RdRp-EHBx complexes with the IC50exp. Further, considering the solvent effect and entropy changes upon ligand binding resulted in a superior QSAR model correlating computed complexation Gibbs free energies (∆∆Gcom). The successive pharmacophore model (PH4) generated from the active conformations of EHBs served as a virtual screening tool of novel analogs included in a virtual combinatorial library (VCL) of compounds with scaffolds restricted to phenyl. The VCL filtered by the Lipinski’s rule-of-five was screened by the PH4 model to identify new EHB analogs. Results: Gas phase QSAR model: -log10(IC50exp) = p IC50exp =-0.1403 x ∆∆HMM _ 7.0879, R2 = 0.73; superior aqueous phase QSAR model: p IC50exp = -0.2036 x ∆∆Gcom + 7.4974, R2 = 0.81 and PH4 pharmacophore model: p IC50exp = 1.0001 x p IC50pre -0.0017, R2 = 0.97. The VCL of more than 30 million EHBs was filtered down to 125,915 analogs Lipinski’s rule. The five-point PH4 screening retained 329 new and potent EHBs with predicted inhibitory potencies p IC50pre up to 30 times lower than that of EHB1 (IC50exp = 23nM). Predicted pharmacokinetic profile of the new analogs showed enhanced cell membrane permeability and high human oral absorption compared to the alone drug to treat dengue virus. Conclusions: Combined use of QSAR models, which considered binding of the EHBs to RdRp, pharmacophore model and ADME properties helped to recognize bound active conformation of the sulfonylbenzamide inhibitors, permitted in silico screening of VCL of compounds sharing sulfonylbenzamide scaffold and identify new analogs with predicted high inhibitory potencies and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles.

Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or proven antiviral treatment against this virus. All four serotypes (1-4) of dengue virus can infect human. An effective dengue vaccine should be tetravalent to induce protective immune responses against all four serotypes. Most of dengue vaccine candidates are monovalent, or in the form of physically mixed multivalent formulations. Recently envelope protein domain III of virus is considered as a vaccine candidate, which plays critical roles in the most important viral activities. Development of a tetravalent protein subunit vaccine is very important for equal induction of immune system and prevention of unbalanced immunity. Here, we have presented and used a rational approach to design a tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate. Materials and Methods We designed a multi domain antigen by fusing four consensus domain III sequences together with appropriate hydrophobic linkers and used several types of bioinformatics software and neural networks to predict structural and immunological properties of the designed tetravalent antigen. Results We designed a tetravalent protein (EDIIIF) based on domain III of dengue virus envelope protein. According to the results of the bioinformatics analysis, the constructed models for EDIIIF protein were structurally stable and potentially immunogenic.

In this study, we aimed to predict the possible interactions between viral proteins that are important for DENV replication and these two flavonoids as potential candidates for anti-DENV drug discovery with known in vitro anti-DENV activity.

Moreover, the binding energy between these compounds and selected proteins was calculated as one of the main criteria for molecular docking studies. The results showed that both compounds of interest, as ligands, can bind with chosen viral proteins, as receptors, through hydrogen bonding and other interactions such as pi–pi interactions, pi–sigma interactions and pi–cation interactions. The obtained data showed significant affinity between the tested compounds and the NS2B–NS3 protease of DENV. Therefore, an in vitro anti-protease assay was conducted and the results showed significant anti-DENV protease activity for both compounds, especially baicalein.

Dengue causes up to 25,000 deaths and nearly a 100 million cases worldwide per year, while the incidence of Zika has increased in recent years. Although Zika has been associated to fetal microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome both it and dengue have common clinical symptoms such as severe headache, retroocular pain, muscle and join pain, nausea, vomiting, and rash. Currently, vaccines have been designed and antivirals have been identified for these diseases but there still need for more options for treatment. Our group previously obtained some fractions from medicinal plants that blocked dengue virus (DENV) infection in vitro. In the present work, we explored the possible targets by molecular docking a group of molecules contained in the plant fractions against DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) NS3-helicase (NS3-hel) and NS3-protease (NS3-pro) structures. Finally, the best ligands were evaluated by molecular dynamic simulations. Methods To establish if these molecules could act as wide spectrum inhibitors, we used structures from four DENV serotypes and from ZIKV. ADFR 1.2 rc1 software was used for docking analysis; subsequently molecular dynamics analysis was carried out using AMBER20. Results Docking suggested that 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (DCA01), quercetin 3-rutinoside (QNR05) and quercetin 3,7-diglucoside (QND10) can tightly bind to both NS3-hel and NS3-pro. However, after a molecular dynamics analysis, tight binding was not maintained for NS3-hel. In contrast, NS3-pro from two dengue serotypes, DENV3 and DENV4, retained both QNR05 and QND10 which converged near the catalytic site. After the molecular dynamics analysis, both ligands presented a stable trajectory over time, in contrast to DCA01. These findings allowed us to work on the design of a molecule called MOD10, using the QND10 skeleton to improve the interaction in the active site of the NS3-pro domain, which was verified through molecular dynamics simulation, turning out to be better than QNR05 and QND10, both in interaction and in the trajectory. Discussion Our results suggests that NS3-hel RNA empty binding site is not a good target for drug design as the binding site located through docking is too big. However, our results indicate that QNR05 and QND10 could block NS3-pro activity in DENV and ZIKV. In the interaction with these molecules, the sub-pocket-2 remained unoccupied in NS3-pro, leaving opportunity for improvement and drug design using the quercetin scaffold.

Therefore, in the present study, we have determined the modulatory effects of DENV infection on the immune response in this organ by carrying out a functional genomic analysis of uninfected salivary glands and salivary glands of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with DENV. We have shown that DENV infection of salivary glands strongly up-regulates the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in the vector's innate immune response, including the immune deficiency (IMD) and Toll signalling pathways, and that it induces the expression of the gene encoding a putative anti-bacterial, cecropin-like, peptide (AAEL000598). Both the chemically synthesized non-cleaved, signal peptide-containing gene product of AAEL000598, and the cleaved, mature form, were found to exert, in addition to antibacterial activity, anti-DENV and anti-Chikungunya viral activity. However, in contrast to the mature form, the immature cecropin peptide was far more effective against Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and, furthermore, had strong anti-parasite activity as shown by its ability to kill Leishmania spp. Results from circular dichroism analysis showed that the immature form more readily adopts a helical conformation which would help it to cause membrane permeabilization, thus permitting its transfer across hydrophobic cell surfaces, which may explain the difference in the anti-pathogenic activity between the two forms.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) causes frequent epidemics infecting ∼390 million people annually in over 100 countries. There are no approved vaccines or antiviral drugs for treatment of infected patients. However, there is a novel approach to control DENV transmission by the mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, using the Wolbachia symbiont. The wMelPop strain of Wolbachia suppresses DENV transmission and shortens the mosquito life span. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. To clarify this mechanism, either naive A. albopictus (C6/36) or wMelPop-C6/36 cells were infected with DENV serotype 2 (DENV2). Analysis of host transcript profiles by transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) revealed that the presence of wMelPop dramatically altered the mosquito host cell transcription in response to DENV2 infection. The viral RNA evolved from wMelPop-C6/36 cells contained low-frequency mutations (∼25%) within the coding region of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) of E protein. Mutations with >97% frequencies were distributed within other regions of E, the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5POL) domain, and the TMDs of NS2A, NS2B, and NS4B. Moreover, while DENV2-infected naive C6/36 cells showed syncytium formation, DENV2-infected wMelPop-C6/36 cells did not. The Wolbachia-induced mutant DENV2 can readily infect and replicate in naive C6/36 cells, whereas in mutant DENV2-infected BHK-21 or Vero cells, virus replication was delayed. In LLC-MK2 cells, the mutant failed to produce plaques. Additionally, in BHK-21 cells, many mutations in the viral genome reverted to the wild type (WT) and compensatory mutations in NS3 gene appeared. Our results indicate that wMelPop impacts significantly the interactions of DENV2 with mosquito and mammalian host cells.

While neutralizing antibodies are considered to play a major role in protection from these diseases, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is an important mechanism involved in disease severity, in addition to the involvement of T lymphocytes. Here, we analyzed relationships between neutralizing and enhancing activities at a clonal level using models of dengue type 2 virus (DENV2) and dengue type 4 virus (DENV4). Totals of 33 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against DENV2 and 43 against DENV4 were generated, all directed to the envelope protein. In these MAbs, enhancing activities were shown at subneutralizing doses under normal ADE assay conditions where test samples were heat inactivated. However, the inclusion of commercial rabbit complement or fresh sera from healthy humans in the ADE assay system abolished the enhancing activities of all these MAbs. The reductive effect of fresh sera on enhancing activities was significantly reduced by their heat inactivation or the use of C1q- or C3-depleted sera. In some fresh sera, enhancing activities were shown within a range of 20 to 80% of normal complement levels in a dose-dependent fashion. These results indicate that a single antibody species possesses two distinct activities (neutralizing/enhancing), which are controlled by the level of complement, suggesting the involvement of complement in dengue disease severity. Fresh human sera also tended to reduce enhancing activities more effectively in homologous than heterologous combinations of viruses (DENV2/DENV4) and MAbs (against DENV2/DENV4).","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results indicate that a single antibody species possesses two distinct activities (neutralizing/enhancing), which are controlled by the level of complement, suggesting the involvement of complement in dengue disease severity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6510,"details":{"paperId":"17fd73a24110bb4f1924a6711cc92591c48fa85b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4575106","MAG":"2336750549","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0138729","CorpusId":"704379","PubMed":"26381649"},"title":"Inferring Protective CD8+ T-Cell Epitopes for NS5 Protein of Four Serotypes of Dengue Virus Chinese Isolates Based on HLA-A, -B and -C Allelic Distribution: Implications for Epitope-Based Universal Vaccine Design","abstract":"Dengue is one of the most globally serious vector-borne infectious diseases in tropical and subtropical areas for which there are currently no effective vaccines.

Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral therapy for prevention or treatment. Monocytes/macrophages are the principal target cells for dengue virus and are responsible for disseminating the virus after its transmission. Dengue virus enters target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis after the viral envelope protein E attaches to the cell surface receptor. This study aimed to investigate the effect of silencing the CD-14 associated molecule and clathrin-mediated endocytosis using siRNA on dengue virus entry into monocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings Gene expression analysis showed a significant down-regulation of the target genes (82.7%, 84.9 and 76.3% for CD-14 associated molecule, CLTC and DNM2 respectively) in transfected monocytes. The effect of silencing of target genes on dengue virus entry into monocytes was investigated by infecting silenced and non-silenced monocytes with DENV-2.

Four putative antiviral peptides were designed to target domain III of DENV-2 E protein using BioMoDroid algorithm. Two peptides showed significant inhibition of DENV when simultaneously incubated as shown by plaque formation assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot analysis. Both DET4 and DET2 showed significant inhibition of virus entry (84.6% and 40.6% respectively) using micromolar concentrations. Furthermore, the TEM images showed that the inhibitory peptides caused structural abnormalities and alteration of the arrangement of the viral E protein, which interferes with virus binding and entry.

Investigation of the stage of the viral life cycle affected revealed that an early event in the life cycle is inhibited.

A panel of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), whose sequences are complementary to RNA elements located in the 5′- and 3′-termini of the West Nile (WN) virus genome, were designed to anneal to important cis-acting elements and potentially to inhibit WN infection. A novel Arg-rich peptide was conjugated to each PMO for efficient cellular delivery. These PMOs exhibited various degrees of antiviral activity upon incubation with a WN virus luciferase-replicon-containing cell line. Among them, PMOs targeting the 5′-terminal 20 nucleotides (5′End) or targeting the 3′-terminal element involved in a potential genome cyclizing interaction (3′CSI) exhibited the greatest potency. When cells infected with an epidemic strain of WN virus were treated with the 5′End or 3′CSI PMO, virus titers were reduced by approximately 5 to 6 logs at a 5 μM concentration without apparent cytotoxicity. The 3′CSI PMO also inhibited mosquito-borne flaviviruses other than WN virus, and the antiviral potency correlated with the conservation of the targeted 3′CSI sequences of specific viruses. Mode-of-action analyses showed that the 5′End and 3′CSI PMOs suppressed viral infection through two distinct mechanisms.

However, no studies have attempted to unravel the mechanism of the plant extract in platelet recovery. Since there are no available drugs to treat dengue and considering the significance of C. papaya in dengue treatment, the current study aimed to evaluate two research questions: First one is to study if the C. papaya leaf extract exerts its action directly on platelets and second one is to understand if the extract can specifically inhibit the platelet aggregation during dengue viral infection. Sixty subjects with dengue positive and 60 healthy subjects were recruited in the study. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma were prepared from both the dengue-infected and healthy control blood samples. Effect of the leaf extract obtained from C. papaya leaves was assessed on plasma obtained as well as platelets collected from both healthy and dengue-infected individuals. Platelet aggregation was significantly reduced when leaf extract preincubated with dengue plasma was added into control PRP, whereas no change in aggregation when leaf extract incubated-control plasma was added into control PRP. Upon direct addition of C. papaya leaf extract, both dengue PRP and control PRP showed a significant reduction in platelet aggregation. Within the dengue group, PRP from severe and nonsevere cases showed a significant decrease in aggregation without any difference between them.

To develop such drugs, a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms of DENV infection is needed. Both lipid metabolism and lipid synthesis are activated in DENV‐infected cells, so we used lipid screening to identify potential antiviral lipid molecules. We identified 1‐stearoyl‐2‐arachidonoyl‐phosphatidylinositol (SAPI), which is the most abundant endogenous phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species, as an anti‐DENV lipid molecule. SAPI suppressed the cytopathic effects induced by DENV2 infection as well as the replication of all DENV serotypes without inhibiting the entry of DENV2 into host cells. However, no other PI molecular species or PI metabolites, including lysophosphatidylinositols and phosphoinositides, displayed anti‐DENV2 activity. Furthermore, SAPI suppressed the production of DENV2 infection‐induced cytokines and chemokines, including C‐C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)5, CCL20, C‐X‐C chemokine ligand 8, IL‐6, and IFN‐β.

Our results revealed that mice infected with DV2 showed alterations in oxidative stress by increasing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation, and GSSG/GSH ratio. DV2-infected mice also showed a decrease in the activity of catalase (CAT) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in the serum and/or observed organs, especially the liver. Moreover, DV2 infection resulted in elevated serum levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interlukin-6 and obvious histopathological changes in the liver. The administration of exogenous GSH significantly reversed all of the aforementioned pathological changes and prevented significant liver damage. Furthermore, in vitro treatment of HepG2 cells with antioxidants such as GSH inhibited viral entry as well as the production of reactive oxygen species in HepG2 cells. These results suggest that GSH prevents DV2-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in mice by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production, and GSH and may be a promising therapeutic agent for prevention of oxidative liver damage during DV infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"GSH prevents DV2-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in

increased dramatically in the last few decades, and the lack of a vaccine has led to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, a convenient murine system to study human T cell responses to DENV has not been available. Mice transgenic for HLA are widely used to model human immune responses, and it has been shown that mouse-passaged DENV is able to replicate to significant levels in IFN-α/βR−/− mice. To cover a wide range of HLA phenotypes, we backcrossed IFN-α/βR−/− mice with HLA A*0201, A*0101, A*1101, B*0702, and DRB1*0101-transgenic mice. A DENV proteome-wide screen identified a total of 42 epitopes across all HLA-transgenic IFN-α/βR−/− strains tested. In contrast, only eight of these elicited responses in the corresponding IFN-α/βR+/+ mice. We were able to identify T cell epitopes from 9 out of the 10 DENV proteins. However, the majority of responses were derived from the highly conserved nonstructural proteins NS3 and NS5. The relevance of this model is further demonstrated by the fact that most of the epitopes identified in our murine system are also recognized by PBMC from DENV-exposed human donors, and a dominance of HLA B*0702-restricted responses has been detected in both systems. Our results provide new insights into HLA-restricted T cell responses against DENV, and we describe in this study a novel murine model that allows the investigation of T cell-mediated immune mechanisms relevant to vaccine design.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A novel murine model is described that allows the investigation of T cell-mediated immune mechanisms relevant to vaccine design and a dominance of HLA B*0702-restricted responses has been detected in both systems."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3599,"details":{"paperId":"e9cabe8481e7c157dce9f95e08ace3ad666b5ec6","externalIds":{"MAG":"2623610748","PubMedCentral":"5612045","DOI":"10.1080/21645515.2017.1333211","CorpusId":"8113349","PubMed":"28598256"},"title":"Integrated immunogenicity analysis of a tetravalent dengue vaccine up to 4 y after vaccination","abstract":"ABSTRACT Two large pivotal phase III studies demonstrated the efficacy of the tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV; Dengvaxia®, Sanofi Pasteur) against all dengue serotypes.

We summarized the immunogenicity profiles of a 3-dose schedule of CYD-TDV administered 6 months apart across 10 phase II and 6 phase III trials undertaken in dengue endemic and non-endemic countries.

CYD-TDV elicits neutralizing antibody responses against all 4 dengue serotypes; geometric mean titers (GMTs) increased from baseline to post-dose 3. GMTs were influenced by several parameters including age, baseline dengue seropositivity and region. In the 2 pivotal studies, GMTs decreased initially during the first 2 y post-dose 3 but appear to stabilize or slightly increase again in the third year. GMTs persisted 1.2–3.2-fold higher than baseline levels for up to 4 y post-dose 3 in other studies undertaken in dengue endemic countries.

Increased risk of severe disease occurs during secondary infection with a virus serotype distinct from that of prior dengue infection. This occurs by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, wherein sub-neutralizing antibodies against the virus particles opsonize dengue virus entry via formation of immune complexes that interact with fragment crystallizable gamma receptors (FcγR) on monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. The ADE phenomenon has two components: Extrinsic and Intrinsic ADE. While extrinsic ADE contributes to enhanced virus entry, intrinsic ADE results in heightened virus production by inhibition of type1 interferon and activation of interleukin-10 biosynthesis, thereby favoring a Th2 type immune response. Intrinsic ADE has greater contribution in enhancing Dengue replication as compared to extrinsic ADE.

DENV and ZIKV belong to the Flaviviridae family and the Flavivirus genus. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic agents to treat or prevent these pathologies. The main objective of this work was to evaluate potential inhibitors from active compounds obtained from Marcetia taxifolia by performing inverse molecular docking on ZIKV-NS3-helicase and ZIKV-NS5-RNA polymerase as targets. This computational strategy is based on renormalizing the binding scores of the compounds to these two proteins, allowing a direct comparison of the results across the proteins. The crystallographic structures of the ZIKV-NS3-helicase and ZIKV-NS5-RNA-polymerase proteins share a great similarity with DENV homologous proteins.

Dengue virus (DENV) belonging to Flaviviridae family carries a positive single strand RNA, consists of four serotypes, gives rise to dengue shock syndrome, undifferentiated fever (DF), and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Unfortunately, there is no licensed drug available for various serotypes and the vaccine candidates are still under investigation. Flavonoids are a group of important phytochemicals of many plants used against various viruses. Therefore, the present study was designed to screen the subset of plant flavonoids against the DENV NS2/NS3 protease of 3L6P and 2VBC of serotype 1 and serotype 4 respectively by in silico docking. Methods: Flavonoids were subjected to docking study using AutoDock Vina. The lead molecule was further investigated for its dengue viral protease inhibition. Further the cytotoxicity of lead molecule was tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) study was performed using OSIRIS software.

A drug for dengue is an urgent unmet need. As conventional drug discovery efforts have not produced any promising clinical candidates, there is a shift toward re-positioning pre-existing drugs for dengue to fast-track dengue drug development. Areas covered: This article provides an update on the current status of recently completed and ongoing dengue drug trials. All dengue drug trials described in this article were identified from a list of >230 trials that were returned upon searching the World Health Organization’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform web portal using the search term ‘dengue’ on December 31st, 2015. Expert opinion: None of the handful of drugs tested so far has yielded encouraging results. Early trial experience has served to emphasize the challenge of drug testing in the short therapeutic time window available, the need for tools to predict ‘high-risk’ patients early on and the limitations of the existing pre-clinical model systems. Significant investment of efforts and resources is a must before the availability of a safe, effective and inexpensive dengue drug becomes a reality. Currently, supportive fluid therapy remains the only option available for dengue treatment.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This article provides an update on the current status of recently completed and ongoing dengue drug trials and highlights the need for tools to predict ‘high-risk’ patients early on and the limitations of the existing pre-clinical model systems."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4202,"details":{"paperId":"9f9847ac08330300c164fe9f1d0617916ce1237b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2132994022","DOI":"10.1099/vir.0.014829-0","CorpusId":"42999317","PubMed":"19776239"},"title":"Involvement of the Fc gamma receptor IIA cytoplasmic domain in antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection.","abstract":"Sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody to dengue virus (DENV) enhance DENV infection of Fc gamma receptor-expressing cells. This phenomenon, referred to as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), has been hypothesized to be responsible for the severe form of DENV infection, including dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. To analyse further the mechanisms of ADE in vitro, this study introduced a series of cytoplasmic mutants into human Fc gammaRIIA. The mutated Fc gammaRIIA was then expressed on COS-7 cells to see whether these mutants could enhance DENV infection. Wild-type Fc gammaRIIA enhanced DENV infection, consistent with previous reports using Fc gammaR-positive monocytes. Disruption of the immune tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic domain of Fc gammaRIIA or removing the sequences between the two ITAM regions eliminated ADE.

Different viral markers can be optimally detected at different stages of infection. Of particular clinical importance is the early identification of infection, which is pivotal for disease management and the development of blood screening assays. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an early surrogate marker of infection and its detection in serum coincides with detectable viraemia. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterise serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to NS1 for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was achieved using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy to direct the antibody selection towards serotype-specific epitopes. This antibody isolation strategy has advantages over immunisation techniques where it is difficult to avoid antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes. Serotype specificity to recombinant antigen for each of the antibodies was confirmed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Surface Plasmon Resonance. Confirmation of binding to native DENV NS1 was achieved using ELISA and immunofluorescence assay on DENV infected Vero cells. No cross-reactivity with Zika or Kunjin viruses was observed. A previously isolated pan-reactive antibody that binds to an immunodominant epitope was able to pair with each of the serotype-specific antibodies in a sandwich ELISA, indicating that the serotype specific antibodies bind to epitopes which are all spatially distinct from the immunodominant epitope. These antibodies were suitable for use in a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV NS1 in human serum.

Potent and safe antivirals are urgently needed.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStarting from the crystal structure of the NS3 helicase from Kunjin virus (an Australian variant of West Nile virus), we identified a novel, unexploited protein site that might be involved in the helicase catalytic cycle and could thus in principle be targeted for enzyme inhibition. In silico docking of a library of small molecules allowed us to identify a few selected compounds with high predicted affinity for the new site. Their activity against helicases from several flaviviruses was confirmed in in vitro helicase/enzymatic assays. The effect on the in vitro replication of flaviviruses was then evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIvermectin, a broadly used anti-helminthic drug, proved to be a highly potent inhibitor of YFV replication (EC₅₀ values in the sub-nanomolar range).

Moreover, the Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine reportedly induces cross-reactive ADE-prone antibodies against DENV, potentially leading to symptomatic dengue. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate the risk of ADE through vaccination. In this study, we attempted to develop a JE vaccine that does not induce ADE of DENV infection using an epitope modification strategy.

An incomplete understanding of pathogenesis, particularly on how non- or subneutralizing levels of antibody augments DENV infection of cells expressing Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs), has hampered vaccine development. Here, we show that, to overcome the activating FcγR-dependent expression of type-I interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), DENV binds and activates the inhibitory receptor, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1). LILRB1 signals through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif cytoplasmic tail to inhibit the expression of ISGs required for successful antibody-dependent DENV infection. Inhibition of DENV activation of LILRB1 could hence be a strategy for vaccine or therapeutic design. Viruses must evade the host innate defenses for replication and dengue is no exception. During secondary infection with a heterologous dengue virus (DENV) serotype, DENV is opsonized with sub- or nonneutralizing antibodies that enhance infection of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells via the Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR), a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection. However, this enhancement of DENV infection is curious as cross-linking of activating FcγRs signals an early antiviral response by inducing the type-I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Entry through activating FcγR would thus place DENV in an intracellular environment unfavorable for enhanced replication. Here we demonstrate that, to escape this antiviral response, antibody-opsonized DENV coligates leukocyte Ig-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) to inhibit FcγR signaling for ISG expression. This immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-bearing receptor recruits Src homology phosphatase-1 to dephosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). As Syk is a key intermediate of FcγR signaling, LILRB1 coligation resulted in reduced ISG expression for enhanced DENV replication.

These opposing outcomes of dengue antibodies have hampered dengue vaccine development. Recent studies have shown that antibodies neutralize DENV by either preventing virus attachment to cellular receptors or inhibiting viral fusion intracellularly. However, whether the antibody blocks attachment or fusion, the resulting immune complexes are expected to be phagocytosed by Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)-bearing cells and cleared from circulation. This suggests that only antibodies that are able to block fusion intracellularly would be able to neutralize DENV upon FcγR-mediated uptake by monocytes whereas other antibodies would have resulted in enhancement of DENV replication. Using convalescent sera from dengue patients, we observed that neutralization of the homologous serotypes occurred despite FcγR-mediated uptake.

We demonstrate that this inhibition occurred through the formation of viral aggregates by antibodies in a concentration-dependent manner.

Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) are classified in the Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae. We prepared monoclonal antibodies against DENV capsid protein from mice immunized with DENV-2 and determined the cross-reactivity with each serotype of DENV and Japanese encephalitis virus. Methods and results To clarify the relationship between the cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of these viruses, we examined the situations of flaviviruses by analyses of phylogenetic trees. Among a total of 60 prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for DENV, five monoclonal antibodies stained the nuclei of infected cells and were found to be specific to the capsid protein. Three were specific to DENV-2, while the other two were cross-reactive with DENV-2 and DENV-4. No monoclonal antibodies were cross-reactive with all four serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of DENV amino acid sequences of the capsid protein revealed that DENV-2 and DENV-4 were clustered in the same branch, while DENV-1 and DENV-3 were clustered in the other branch. However, these classifications of the capsid protein were different from those of the envelope and nonstructural 1 proteins. Phylogenetic distances between the four serotypes of DENV were as different as those of other flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. Large variations in the DENV serotypes were comparable with the differences between species of flavivirus. Furthermore, the diversity of flavivirus capsid protein was much greater than that of envelope and nonstructural 1 proteins. Conclusion In this study, we produced specific monoclonal antibodies that can be used to detect DENV-2 capsid protein, but not a cross-reactive one with all serotypes of DENV capsid protein.

Very interestingly, 3-α-tigloyl-melianol and melianone showed a potent antiviral activity (EC50 in the range of 3–11μM) against three important human pathogens, belonging to Flaviviridae family, West Nile virus, Dengue virus and Yellow Fever virus. Mode of action studies demonstrated that title compounds were inhibitors of West Nile virus only when added during the infection, acting as inhibitors of the entry or of a very early event of life cycle. Furthermore, 3-α-tigloyl-melianol and methyl kulonate showed interesting antimycobacterial activity (with MIC values of 29 and 70 μM respectively). The limonoids are typically lipophilic compounds present in the fruits of Melia azeradach. They are known as cytotoxic compounds against different cancer cell lines, while their potential as antiviral and antibacterial was poorly investigated. Our studies show that they may serve as a good starting point for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of infections by Flaviviruses and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for which there is a continued need.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Investigation of the cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimycobacterial activity of the methanol extract and of four identified limonoids from the fruits of Melia azedarach shows that they may serve as a good starting point for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of infections by Flaviviruses and Mycobacterium tuberculosis."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7455,"details":{"paperId":"77e2393da40d55c17ba55f1a0c04943f31a4d9e5","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8387565","DOI":"10.3389/fcimb.2021.710551","CorpusId":"236983448","PubMed":"34458161"},"title":"Linear and Continuous Flavivirus Epitopes From Naturally Infected Humans","abstract":"This manuscript is an up-to-date review of experimentally validated linear and continuous epitopes identified from arbovirus members of the Flavivirus genus.

There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral treatment against ZIKV infection. The effort to understand the complex interactions of ZIKV with cellular networks contributes to the identification of novel host-directed antiviral (HDA) candidates. Among the cellular pathways involved in infection, lipid metabolism gains attention. In ZIKV-infected cells lipid metabolism attributed to intracellular membrane remodeling, virion morphogenesis, autophagy modulation, innate immunity and inflammation. The key roles played by the cellular structures associated with lipid metabolism, such as peroxisomes and lipid droplets, are starting to be deciphered. Consequently, there is a wide variety of lipid-related antiviral strategies that are currently under consideration, which include an inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), the activation of adenosine-monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), an inhibition of acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), interference with sphingolipid metabolism, blockage of intracellular cholesterol trafficking, or a treatment with cholesterol derivatives. Remarkably, most of the HDAs identified in these studies are also effective against flaviviruses other than ZIKV (West Nile virus and dengue virus), supporting their broad-spectrum effect.

The existence of four serotypes of dengue virus has complicated the development of an effective and safe dengue vaccine. Recently, a clinical phase 2b trial of Sanofi Pasteur's CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine revealed that the vaccine did not confer full protection against dengue-2 virus. New approaches to dengue vaccine development are urgently needed. Our approach represents a promising method of dengue vaccine development and may even complement the deficiencies of the CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine. Methodology/Principal Findings Two important components of a vaccine, the immunogen and immunopotentiator, were combined into a single construct to generate a new generation of vaccines. We selected dengue-2 envelope protein domain III (D2ED III) as the immunogen and expressed this protein in lipidated form in Escherichia coli, yielding an immunogen with intrinsic immunopotentiation activity. The formulation containing lipidated D2ED III (LD2ED III) in the absence of exogenous adjuvant elicited higher D2ED III-specific antibody responses than those obtained from its nonlipidated counterpart, D2ED III, and dengue-2 virus. In addition, the avidity and neutralizing capacity of the antibodies induced by LD2ED III were higher than those elicited by D2ED III and dengue-2 virus. Importantly, we showed that after lipidation, the subunit candidate LD2ED III exhibited increased immunogenicity while reducing the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in mice.

Forty-two healthy YF naïve adults randomly received a single dose of either ChimeriVax™-DEN2 (high dose, 5 log plaque forming units [PFU] or low dose, 3 log PFU) or YF-VAXâ by the subcutaneous route (SC). To determine the effect of YF pre-immunity on the ChimeriVaxTM-DEN2 vaccine, 14 subjects previously vaccinated against YF received a high dose of ChimeriVax™-DEN2 as an open-label vaccine. Most adverse events were similar to YF-VAX® and of mild to moderate intensity, with no serious side-effects. One hundred percent and 92.3% of YF naïve subjects inoculated with 5.0 and 3.0 log10 PFU of ChimeriVaxTM-DEN2, respectively, seroconverted to wt DEN2 (strain 16681); 92% of subjects inoculated with YF-VAX® seroconverted to YF 17D virus but none of YF naïve subjects inoculated with ChimeriVax-DEN2 seroconverted to YF 17D virus.

DENV is a member of the Flaviviridae family and has 4 distinct serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). No lasting cross protection is afforded to heterologous serotypes following infection by any one of the individual serotypes. The presence of nonneutralizing antibodies to one serotype can facilitate the occurrence of more-severe dengue hemorrhagic fever through immune enhancement upon infection with a second serotype. For this reason, the development of a safe, tetravalent vaccine to produce a balanced immune response to all four serotypes is critical. We have developed a novel approach to produce safe and effective live-attenuated vaccines for DENV and other insect-borne viruses. Host range (HR) mutants of each DENV serotype were created by truncating transmembrane domain 1 of the E protein and selecting for strains of DENV that replicated well in insect cells but not mammalian cells. These vaccine strains were tested for immunogenicity in African green monkeys (AGMs). No vaccine-related adverse events occurred. The vaccine strains were confirmed to be attenuated in vivo by infectious center assay (ICA). Analysis by 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) established that by day 62 postvaccination, 100% of animals seroconverted to DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4. Additionally, the DENV HR tetravalent vaccine (HR-Tet) showed a tetravalent anamnestic immune response in 100% (16/16) of AGMs after challenge with wild-type (WT) DENV strains. IMPORTANCE We have generated a live attenuated viral (LAV) vaccine capable of eliciting a strong immune response in African green monkeys (AGMs) in a single dose. This vaccine is delivered by injecting one of four attenuated serotypes into each limb of the animal. 100% of animals given the vaccine generated antibodies against all 4 serotypes, and this response was found to be balanced in nature.

In 2010, a major DENV-2 outbreak occurred in Gabon with cases of patients co-infected with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Although the innate immune response is thought to be of primordial importance in the development and outcome of arbovirus-associated pathologies, our knowledge of the role of natural killer (NK) cells during DENV-2 infection is in its infancy. Methodology We performed the first extensive comparative longitudinal characterization of NK cells in patients infected by DENV-2, CHIKV or both viruses. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses were performed to discriminate between CHIKV and DENV-2 infected patients. Principal Findings We observed that both activation and differentiation of NK cells are induced during the acute phase of infection by DENV-2 and CHIKV. Combinatorial analysis however, revealed that both arboviruses induced two different signatures of NK-cell responses, with CHIKV more associated with terminal differentiation, and DENV-2 with inhibitory KIRs. We show also that intracellular production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by NK cells is strongly stimulated in acute DENV-2 infection, compared to CHIKV.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of LOV on the survival rate and viremia levels of DENV-2-infected AG129 mice. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were inoculated with 1×106 plaque-forming units (PFU/ml) of DENV-2 and treated with LOV (200 mg/kg/day). Pre-treatment with one or three doses of LOV increased the survival rate compared to untreated mice (7.3 and 7.1 days, respectively, compared to 4.8 days). Viremia levels also decreased by 21.8% compared to untreated mice, but only in the group administered three doses prior to inoculation. When LOV was administered after viral inoculation, the survival rate increased (7.3 days in the group treated at 24 hpi, 6.8 days in the group treated at 48 hpi and 6.5 days in the group treated with two doses) compared to the untreated group (4.8 days). Interestingly, the serum viral titer increased by 24.6% in mice treated at 48 hpi with a single dose of LOV and by 21.7% in mice treated with two doses (at 24 and 48 hpi) of LOV compared to untreated mice. Finally histopathological changes in the liver and spleen in infected and untreated mice included massive extramedullary erythropoiesis foci and inflammatory filtration, and these characteristics were decreased or absent in LOV-treated mice. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the effect of LOV on viremia depends on the timing of treatment and on the number of doses administered.

Severe cases occur more often in patients who experience a secondary infection with a different virus serotype. A phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been proposed to explain the onset of these severe cases, but the exact mechanism of ADE remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Finding Virus neutralization and ADE assays were performed using ultracentrifugation supernatants of acute-phase sera from patients with secondary infections or human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) as anti-DENV antibodies. Virus sources included infectious serum-derived viruses from the ultracentrifugation precipitates, laboratory-culture adapted DENV, or recombinant DENVs derived from patient sera. In contrast to the high levels of ADE observed with laboratory virus strains, low ADE was observed with autologous patient-derived viruses, when patient sera were used to provide the antibody component in the ADE assays. Similar results were obtained using samples from DF and DHF patients. Recombinant-viruses derived from DHF patients showed only minor differences in neutralization and ADE activity in the presence of HuMAbs or plasma derived from the same DHF patient. Conclusion/Significance Serum or plasma taken from patients during the acute phase of a secondary infection showed high levels of ADE, but no neutralization activity, when assayed in the presence of laboratory-adapted virus strains. By contrast, serum or plasma from the same patient showed high levels of neutralization activity but failed to induce significant ADE when the assays were performed with autologous virus.

Currently, there is no effective therapeutic agent or vaccine against DENV infection; hence, there is an urgent need to discover anti-DENV agents. The potential therapeutic efficacy of lucidone was first evaluated in vivo using a DENV-infected Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) suckling mouse model by monitoring body weight, clinical score, survival rate, and viral titer. We found that lucidone effectively protected mice from DENV infection by sustaining survival rate and reducing viral titers in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice. Then, the anti-DENV activity of lucidone was confirmed by western blotting and quantitative-reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, with an EC50 value of 25 ± 3 μM. Lucidone significantly induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) production against DENV replication by inhibiting DENV NS2B/3 protease activity to induce the DENV-suppressed antiviral interferon response. The inhibitory effect of lucidone on DENV replication was attenuated by silencing of HO-1 gene expression or blocking HO-1 activity. In addition, lucidone-stimulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is involved in transactivation of HO-1 expression for its anti-DENV activity. Taken together, the mechanistic investigations revealed that lucidone exhibits significant anti-DENV activity in in vivo and in vitro by inducing Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression, leading to blockage of viral protease activity to induce the anti-viral interferon (IFN) response.

Nowadays, diverse serological assays are available to diagnose flaviviruses. However, infection with flaviviruses induces cross-reactive antibodies, which are a challenge for serological diagnosis. Objective This systematic review aimed to assess the magnitude of medically important mosquito-borne flavivirus–induced antibody cross-reactivity and its influence on serological test outcomes. Methods This study was designed based on the PRISMA guidelines. It includes original research articles published between 1994 and 2019 that reported serological cross-reactions between medically important mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Articles were searched on PubMed using controlled vocabulary. Eligibility was assessed by title, abstract, and finally by reading the full paper. The articles included are compared, evaluated, and summarized narratively. Results A total of 2,911 articles were identified, and finally 14 were included. About 15.4%–84% of antibodies produced against non-DENV flaviviruses were cross-reactive with DENV on different assays. Up to 30% IgM and up to 60% IgG antibodies produced against non-WNV flaviviruses were cross-reactive with WNV on EIA assays. The magnitude of antibodies produced against flaviviruses that are cross-reactive with chikungunya virus (Alphavirus) was minimal (only about 7%). The highest antibody cross-reactivity of flaviviruses was reported in IgG-based assays compared to IgM-based assays and assays based on E-specific immunoglobulin compared to NS1-specific immunoglobulin. It was found that preexisting immunity due to vaccination or prior flavivirus exposure to antigenetically related species enhanced the cross-reactive antibody titer. Conclusion This review found the highest cross-reaction between DENV and non-DENV flaviviruses, especially yellow fever virus, and the least between chikungunya virus and DENV. Moreover, cross-reaction was higher on IgG assays than IgM ones and assays based on Eprotein compared to NS1protein. This implies that the reliability of serological test results in areas where more than one flavivirus exists is questionable. Therefore, interpretation of the existing serological assays should be undertaken with a great caution. Furthermore, research on novel diagnostic signatures for differential diagnosis of flaviviruses is needed.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It was found that preexisting immunity due to vaccination or prior flavivirus exposure to antigenetically related species enhanced the cross-reactive antibody titer, implying that the reliability of serological test results in areas where more than one flaviviruses exists is questionable."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2915,"details":{"paperId":"50dc89e3ff490c757c1a2060bf59b595fef37a97","externalIds":{"MAG":"2737392686","PubMedCentral":"6044859","DOI":"10.1021/acsomega.7b00608","CorpusId":"51638380","PubMed":"30023708"},"title":"Mapping Putative B-Cell Zika Virus NS1 Epitopes Provides Molecular Basis for Anti-NS1 Antibody Discrimination between Zika and Dengue Viruses","abstract":"B-cell epitope sequences from Zika virus (ZIKV) NS1 protein have been identified using epitope prediction tools.

The murine monoclonal antibody 4E11 might be of interest, since it neutralizes dengue viruses of all serotypes by binding to the 296-400 segment of the major dengue virus envelope glycoprotein (DE). When phage-displayed peptide libraries were screened by affinity for 4E11, phage clone C1 was selected with a 50% frequency. C1 shared three of nine residues with DE(306-314) and showed significant reactivity to 4E11 in ELISA. C1-induced antibodies cross-reacted with DE(296-400) in mice, suggesting that it was a structural equivalent of the native epitope of 4E11 on DE. Accordingly, 4E11 bound to the DE(306-314) synthetic peptide and this reaction was inhibited by DE(296-400). Moreover, DE(306-314) could block dengue virus infection of target cells in an in vitro assay.

People exposed to DENV develop antibodies (Abs) that strongly neutralize the serotype responsible for infection. Historically, infection with DENV serotype 4 (DENV4) has been less common and less studied than infections with the other three serotypes. However, DENV4 has been responsible for recent large and sustained epidemics in Asia and Latin America. The neutralizing antibody responses and the epitopes targeted against DENV4 have not been characterized in human infection. In this study, we mapped and characterized epitopes on DENV4 recognized by neutralizing antibodies in people previously exposed to DENV4 infections or to a live attenuated DENV4 vaccine. To study the fine specificity of DENV4 neutralizing human antibodies, B cells from two people exposed to DENV4 were immortalized and screened to identify DENV-specific clones. Two human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that neutralized DENV4 were isolated, and their epitopes were finely mapped using recombinant viruses and alanine scan mutation array techniques. Both antibodies bound to quaternary structure epitopes near the hinge region between envelope protein domain I (EDI) and EDII. In parallel, to characterize the serum neutralizing antibody responses, convalescence-phase serum samples from people previously exposed to primary DENV4 natural infections or a monovalent DENV4 vaccine were analyzed. Natural infection and vaccination also induced serum-neutralizing antibodies that targeted similar epitope domains at the EDI/II hinge region. These studies defined a target of neutralizing antigenic site on DENV4 targeted by human antibodies following natural infection or vaccination. IMPORTANCE The four serotypes of dengue virus are the causative agents of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. People exposed to primary DENV infections develop long-term neutralizing antibody responses, but these principally recognize only the infecting serotype. An effective vaccine against dengue should elicit long-lasting protective antibody responses to all four serotypes simultaneously. We and others have defined antigenic sites on the envelope (E) protein of viruses of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 targeted by human neutralizing antibodies. The epitopes on DENV4 E protein targeted by the human neutralizing antibodies and the mechanisms of serotype 4 neutralization are poorly understood. Here, we report the properties of human antibodies that neutralize dengue virus serotype 4. People exposed to serotype 4 infections or a live attenuated serotype 4 vaccine developed neutralizing antibodies that bound to similar sites on the viral E protein. These studies have provided a foundation for developing and evaluating DENV4 vaccines.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The properties of human antibodies that neutralize dengue virus serotype 4 are reported, and a target of neutralizing antigenic site on DENV4 targeted by human antibodies following natural infection or vaccination is defined."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1548,"details":{"paperId":"2721ae719b13e5e7cdc7bdd6ee2fe6c5fdebdf86","externalIds":{"MAG":"3049398930","DOI":"10.1016/j.coviro.2020.07.006","CorpusId":"221143672","PubMed":"32801077"},"title":"Mapping the diverse structural landscape of the flavivirus antibody repertoire.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work compares the available structural data of several flavivirus antibody complexes with a major focus on Zika virus and dengue virus and discusses the mapped epitopes, the stoichiometry of antibody binding and mechanisms of neutralization."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4277,"details":{"paperId":"ef568b43e33525e4d9ce225e7b0c704f5e2800f3","externalIds":{"MAG":"2128155928","DOI":"10.1099/VIR.0.83028-0","CorpusId":"21925373","PubMed":"17698647"},"title":"Mapping to completeness and transplantation of a group-specific, discontinuous, neutralizing epitope in the envelope protein of dengue virus.","abstract":"Dengue is caused by a taxonomic group of four viruses, dengue virus types 1-4 (DENV1-DENV4).

DHF occurs in two distinct clinical settings: a) in children and adults with secondary DENV infection, and b) in infants with primary DENV infection born to mothers with prior DENV infection. The ADE hypothesis proposes that pre-existing serotype-cross-reactive non-neutralizing anti-DENV antibodies bind the heterotypic DENV during secondary infection and enhance its uptake into immune cells, leading to increased viral load and DHF. This model suggests that DHF in DENV-infected infants is caused by the enhancing effect of waning maternal anti-DENV antibodies, thus causing a “physiologic secondary infection” during an infant’s primary infection and thereby increasing the infant’s risk for DHF. The effect of maternal immunity on DHF in infants has been studied exclusively in Southeast Asia. However, the maternal DENV seroprevalence approaches 100% in this part of the world. As a consequence, the ADE model of infant DHF cannot truly be tested in Southeast Asia, because all infants possess anti-DENV antibody at birth. In the Western Hemisphere, by contrast, women may have experienced either a single DENV infection, more than one DENV infection, or no DENV infection at all. The ability to include DENV-seronegative mothers as controls allows for the ADE hypothesis to be directly tested in a clinical study. To our knowledge, no such study has been previously conducted. This thesis presents a case-control study designed to evaluate the influence of positive maternal dengue seroprevalence on the risk of DHF in infants.

Dengue pathogenesis and the factors influencing it are not completely known. It is now widely speculated that there is an important role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the initiation and progression of dengue pathogenesis; however, their exact roles are not fully understood. Overactivation of matrix metalloproteinases may contribute to the severity of dengue pathogenesis. Cytokines and various other mediators of inflammation interact with the vascular endothelium and matrix metalloproteinases may be one of the components among them. Extensive plasma leakage into tissue spaces may result in a shock. It is evident in the literature that MMP2 and MMP9 increase in dengue patients is correlated with the severity of the disease; however, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Activation of innate cells and adaptive immune cells which include, B and T cells, macrophages or monocytes and dendritic cells also contribute to the dengue pathology. Newer therapeutic strategies include microRNAs, such as miR‐134 (targets MMP3 and MMP1) and MicroRNA‐320d, (targets MMP/TIMP proteolytic system). The use of antibodies‐based therapeutics like (Andecaliximab; anti‐matrix metalloproteinase‐9 antibody) is also suggested against MMPs in dengue.

Sadly, serious flaws in their study's design and methodology preclude rigorous interpretation of these data. Nonetheless, the authors have identified a research question of central importance to an understanding of the biology of DV infection enhancement in vivo and should be encouraged to continue this research. Comparative data permitting K562 cells, a stable line of human leukemia cells, to be accepted as a surrogate for primary human blood monocytes, which comprised the test system in an earlier study, will be important to future studies of DV enhancing antibodies [2]. With respect to the correlation between enhancing antibodies and disease severity during secondary DV serotype 3 (DV3) infection, the authors observed EA in all but 1 of 27 undiluted preillness plasma samples from children experiencing overt dengue illness. This result is similar to that obtained by Kliks et al. [2]. A challenge to the reader is how to interpret the results Laoprasopwattana et aI. obtained by testing plasma from only the 10 inapparently infected individuals in their study. First, these individuals may not have had secondary DV3 infection. The authors missed a crucial opportunity to document the eti-ology of these infections by failing to test posttransmission plasma for neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, all but 1 (case 31) of the 10 preseason plasma samples contained DV3 neutralizing antibodies, some at high titers. It was conjectured that both inapparently infected children and children with overt illness, because they were schoolmates, must have had secondary DV3 infection. However, as was illustrated in prospective cohort studies in Thailand and Indonesia, different DVs can be the cause of overt versus inapparent secondary infection during the same outbreak [3,4]. With respect to attempts to correlate EA with viremia level, Laoprasopwattana et aI. chose to measure viremia in a single acute-phase blood sample, labeling this as \"peak viremia level.\" In an earlier publication, many of these same authors established a reference standard in which a peak was observed in a viremia curve constructed by assaying virus in acute-phase plasma collected over a period of 5 consecutive days [5].

Accordingly, we tested the inhibitory effects of the novel θ-defensin retrocyclin-101 (RC-101) against flavivirus infection and investigated the mechanism underlying the potential inhibitory effects. First, RC-101 robustly inhibited both Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections. RC-101 exerted inhibitory effects on the entry and replication stages. Results also indicated that the nonstructural protein NS2B-NS3 serine protease might serve as a potential viral target. Furthermore, RC-101 inhibited protease activity at the micromolar level. We also demonstrated that with respect to the glycoprotein E protein of flavivirus, the DE loop of domain III (DIII), which is the receptor-binding domain of the E protein, might serve as another viral target of RC-101. Moreover, a JEV DE mutant exhibited resistance to RC-101, which was associated with deceased binding affinity of RC-101 to DIII. These findings provide a basis for the development of RC-101 as a potential candidate for the treatment of flavivirus infection. IMPORTANCE Retrocyclin is an artificially humanized circular θ-defensin peptide, containing 18 residues, previously reported to possess broad antimicrobial activity. In this study, we found that retrocyclin-101 inhibited flavivirus (ZIKV and JEV) infections. Retrocyclin-101 inhibited NS2B-NS3 serine protease activity, suggesting that the catalytic triad of the protease is the target. Moreover, retrocyclin-101 bound to the DE loop of the E protein of flavivirus, which prevented its entry.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The inhibitory effects of the novel θ-defensin retrocyclin-101 (RC-101) against flavivirus infection are found, suggesting that the catalytic triad of the protease is the target."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":423,"details":{"paperId":"834b8c04a3eaca7e4658e1662c2842f134e1ba9c","externalIds":{"MAG":"2805959829","PubMedCentral":"7121742","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-10-8727-1_20","CorpusId":"44070620","PubMed":"29845540"},"title":"Mechanisms of Antiviral Activity of Iminosugars Against Dengue Virus","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Data suggest that inhibition of α-glucosidases results in inhibited release of virus and is the primary antiviral mechanism of action of iminosugars against DENV."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3692,"details":{"paperId":"5bb0354850c078e6c4f3124439f42655f33fc9f0","externalIds":{"MAG":"2166183736","DOI":"10.1086/651018","CorpusId":"14312777","PubMed":"20158392"},"title":"Mechanisms of immune evasion induced by a complex of dengue virus and preexisting enhancing antibodies.","abstract":"We have found that dengue virus (DENV) not only uses preexisting enhancing antibodies to promote its entry into Fc receptor-bearing cells but also exploits enhancing antibodies for intracellular immune evasion through 2 mechanisms.

Mechanistic studies with anti-dengue virus (DENV) human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) provide a rational approach to identify and characterize neutralizing epitopes on DENV structural proteins that can serve to inform vaccine strategies. Here, we report a class of hMAbs that is likely to be an important determinant in the human humoral response to DENV infection. In this study, we identified and characterized three broadly neutralizing anti-DENV hMAbs: 4.8A, D11C, and 1.6D. These antibodies were isolated from three different convalescent patients with distinct histories of DENV infection yet demonstrated remarkable similarities. All three hMAbs recognized the E glycoprotein with high affinity, neutralized all four serotypes of DENV, and mediated antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in Fc receptor-bearing cells at subneutralizing concentrations. The neutralization activities of these hMAbs correlated with a strong inhibition of virus-liposome and intracellular fusion, not virus-cell binding. We mapped epitopes of these antibodies to the highly conserved fusion loop region of E domain II. Mutations at fusion loop residues W101, L107, and/or G109 significantly reduced the binding of the hMAbs to E protein. The results show that hMAbs directed against the highly conserved E protein fusion loop block viral entry downstream of virus-cell binding by inhibiting E protein-mediated fusion.

There is still no effective drug or vaccine for treatment of DENV infection. In this study, we set forth to investigate the effect of melatonin, which is a natural hormone with multiple pharmacological functions, against DENV infection. Treatment with subtoxic doses of melatonin dose-dependently inhibited DENV production. Cross-protection across serotypes and various cell types was also observed. Time-of-addition assay suggested that melatonin exerts its influence during the post-entry step of viral infection. The antiviral activity of melatonin partly originates from activation of the sirtuin pathway since co-treatment with melatonin and the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor reversed the effect of melatonin treatment alone.

Half of the world’s population lives under the threat of dengue fever, however, researchers have yet to develop any drugs that are clinically applicable to this infection. Micafungin is a member of the echinocandins family of anti-fungal drugs, capable of blocking the synthesis of β-1,3-D-glucan in the walls of fungal cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Micafungin against infections of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). This is the first study demonstrating the effectiveness of micafungin in inhibiting the cytopathic effects of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) in a dose-dependent manner. Time-of-addition assays verified the inhibitory effects of micafungin in pre-treated, co-treated, and full-treatment groups. Binding and entry assays also demonstrated the effectiveness of micafungin in the early stage of DENV-2 infection. The virucidal efficacy of micafungin appears to lie in its ability to destroy the virion. Molecular docking assays revealed the binding of micafungin to the envelope protein of DENV-2, thereby revealing the mechanism by which micafungin affects the early stage of DENV infection and the stability of DENV. Two other micafungin analogs, caspofungin and anidulafungin, were also shown to have the antiviral effects on DENV-2.

Insertion of a single copy of a target for brain-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in the 3′ noncoding region (3′NCR) of the flavivirus genome (chimeric tick-borne encephalitis virus/dengue virus) abolished virus neurovirulence in the mature mouse CNS. However, in the developing CNS of highly permissive suckling mice, the miRNA-targeted viruses can revert to a neurovirulent phenotype by accumulating deletions or mutations within the miRNA target sequence. Virus escape from miRNA-mediated suppression in the developing CNS was markedly diminished by increasing the number of miRNA target sites and by extending the distance between these sites in the virus genome. Insertion of multiple miRNA targets into the 3′NCR altered virus neuroinvasiveness, decreased neurovirulence and neuroinflammatory responses, and prevented neurodegeneration without loss of immunogenicity. Although the onset of encephalitis was delayed, a small number of suckling mice still succumbed to lethal intracerebral infection with the miRNA-targeted viruses. Sequence analysis of brain isolates from moribund mice revealed that the viruses escaped from miRNA-mediated suppression exclusively through the deletion of miRNA targets and viral genome sequence located between the two miRNA targets separated by the greatest distance. These findings offer a general strategy to control the reversion of virus to a virulent phenotype: a simultaneous miRNA targeting of the viral genome at many different functionally important regions could prevent virus escape from miRNA-based attenuation, since a deletion of the targeted genomic sequences located between the inserted miRNA binding sites would be lethal for the virus.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A simultaneous miRNA targeting of the viral genome at many different functionally important regions could prevent virus escape from miRNA-based attenuation, since a deletion of the targeted genomic sequences located between the inserted miRNA binding sites would be lethal for the virus."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6267,"details":{"paperId":"17f28714151866618c673b91abd3f5e71d6f83d2","externalIds":{"MAG":"2765268912","PubMedCentral":"5662241","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0005981","CorpusId":"20706978","PubMed":"29045406"},"title":"MicroRNA profiling of human primary macrophages exposed to dengue virus identifies miRNA-3614-5p as antiviral and regulator of ADAR1 expression","abstract":"Background Due to the high burden of dengue disease worldwide, a better understanding of the interactions between dengue virus (DENV) and its human host cells is of the utmost importance.

To this end, human primary macrophages were challenged with GFP-expressing DENV and sorted to differentiate between truly infected cells (DENV-positive) and DENV-exposed but non-infected cells (DENV-negative cells). The miRNAome was determined by small RNA-Seq analysis and the effect of differentially expressed microRNAs on DENV yield was examined. Five microRNAs were differentially expressed in human macrophages challenged with DENV.

Caused by four antigenically distinct but related serotypes, disease severity is associated with the immunological status of the individual, seronegative or seropositive, prior to a natural dengue infection. While a primary natural dengue infection is often asymptomatic or mild, individuals experiencing a secondary dengue infection with a heterologous serotype have higher risk of developing the severe form of the disease, linked to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) process. We develop a modeling framework to describe the dengue immune responses mediated by antibodies. Our model framework can describe qualitatively the dynamic of the viral load and antibodies production for scenarios of primary and secondary infections, as found in the empirical immunology literature. Studies such as the one described here serve as a baseline to further model extensions. Future refinements of our framework will be of use to evaluate the impact of imperfect dengue vaccines. Abstract Dengue fever is a viral mosquito-borne infection and a major international public health concern. With 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection around the world, disease severity is influenced by the immunological status of the individual, seronegative or seropositive, prior to natural infection. Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers life-long immunity to that serotype and a period of temporary cross-immunity (TCI) to other serotypes. The clinical response on exposure to a second serotype is complex with the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) process, a disease augmentation phenomenon when pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but rather enhance the new infection, used to explain the etiology of severe disease. In this paper, we present a minimalistic mathematical model framework developed to describe qualitatively the dengue immunological response mediated by antibodies. Three models are analyzed and compared: (i) primary dengue infection, (ii) secondary dengue infection with the same (homologous) dengue virus and (iii) secondary dengue infection with a different (heterologous) dengue virus. We explore the features of viral replication, antibody production and infection clearance over time. The model is developed based on body cells and free virus interactions resulting in infected cells activating antibody production. Our mathematical results are qualitatively similar to the ones described in the empiric immunology literature, providing insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe disease. Results presented here are of use for future research directions to evaluate the impact of dengue vaccines.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A minimalistic mathematical model framework developed to describe qualitatively the dengue immunological response mediated by antibodies is presented, providing insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe disease."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1461,"details":{"paperId":"30fb4472155b11ea4dcd8ee33fab72c60ba4becd","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111448","CorpusId":"242006643"},"title":"Modeling and complexity in dynamics of T-cells and cytokines in dengue fever based on antiviral treatment","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1406,"details":{"paperId":"3a8e988fe77736614f655ce51f274b647717eacf","externalIds":{"MAG":"2536800038","DOI":"10.1016/j.bpj.2016.09.003","CorpusId":"21227523","PubMed":"27760352"},"title":"Modeling the Role of Epitope Arrangement on Antibody Binding Stoichiometry in Flaviviruses.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Cryo-electron-microscopy structures of flaviviruses reveal significant variation in epitope occupancy across different monoclonal antibodies that have largely been attributed to epitope-level differences in conformation or accessibility, and a structure-based explanation for the stoichiometric threshold model of neutralization is proposed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6047,"details":{"paperId":"9753278824761810d1ff18e7405cbe52f5a73ba6","externalIds":{"DBLP":"journals/ploscb/ClaphamQKDSF16","PubMedCentral":"4877086","MAG":"2397538922","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004951","CorpusId":"3621802","PubMed":"27213681"},"title":"Modelling Virus and Antibody Dynamics during Dengue Virus Infection Suggests a Role for Antibody in Virus Clearance","abstract":"Dengue is an infection of increasing global importance, yet uncertainty remains regarding critical aspects of its virology, immunology and epidemiology.

Antibody is thought to play a role, but little past work has examined the kinetics of both virus and antibody during natural infections. We present data on multiple virus and antibody titres measurements recorded sequentially during infection from 53 Vietnamese dengue patients. We fit mechanistic mathematical models of the dynamics of viral replication and the host immune response to these data. These models fit the data well. The model with antibody removing virus fits the data best, but with a role suggested for ADCC or other infected cell clearance mechanisms. Our analysis therefore shows that the observed viral and antibody kinetics are consistent with antibody playing a key role in controlling viral replication.

Owing to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), secondary infection with one Flavivirus following primary infection with another Flavivirus can result in a significantly larger peak viral load with a much higher risk of severe disease. Although several mathematical models have been developed to quantify the virus dynamics in the primary and secondary infections of DENV, little progress has been made regarding secondary infection of DENV after a primary infection of ZIKV, or DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Here, we address this critical gap by developing compartmental models of virus dynamics. We first fitted the models to published data on dengue viral loads of the primary and secondary infections with the observation that the primary infection reaches its peak much more gradually than the secondary infection. We then quantitatively show that ADE is the key factor determining a sharp increase/decrease of viral load near the peak time in the secondary infection. In comparison, our simulations of DENV and ZIKV co-infection (simultaneous rather than sequential) show that ADE has very limited influence on the peak DENV viral load. This indicates pre-existing immunity to ZIKV is the determinant of a high level of ADE effect. Our numerical simulations show that (i) in the absence of ADE effect, a subsequent co-infection is beneficial to the second virus; and (ii) if ADE is feasible, then a subsequent co-infection can induce greater damage to the host with a higher peak viral load and a much earlier peak time for the second virus, and for the second peak for the first virus.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1898,"details":{"paperId":"69f8a90f0d8ee56f10d46324e263b3d0687763ae","externalIds":{"MAG":"2128782335","DOI":"10.1016/J.JTBI.2006.03.002","CorpusId":"20003560","PubMed":"16631802"},"title":"Modelling the relationship between antibody-dependent enhancement and immunological distance with application to dengue.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is concluded that mortality enhancement must be dominant if ADE really is responsible for the immunological distance between dengue serotypes and that transmission and mortality enhancement can lead to periodicity or chaos."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2245,"details":{"paperId":"0ab127b54b53aea6a5904e766d1cd6ffa6383a8a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2100762330","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.042","CorpusId":"27424727","PubMed":"21699949"},"title":"Models of the impact of dengue vaccines: a review of current research and potential approaches.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A key parameter of all approaches is the basic reproduction number, R(0), which can be used to determine the critical vaccination fraction to eliminate transmission, and several methods that have been used to estimate this quantity are reviewed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1238,"details":{"paperId":"2103176ef4a5805310edf6cc91528b376e82accf","externalIds":{"MAG":"2538847197","DOI":"10.1016/j.apjtm.2016.07.036","CorpusId":"205591981","PubMed":"27890375"},"title":"Modifiable determinants of attitude towards dengue vaccination among healthy inhabitants of Aceh, Indonesia: Findings from a community-based survey.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study reveals that low KAP regarding d Dengue fever, low education level and low socioeconomic status are associated with a poor attitude towards dengue vaccination, and inhabitants of suburbs who are working as farmers or traditional market traders with low socioeconomicstatus are the most appropriate target group for a denge vaccine introduction program."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8068,"details":{"paperId":"3b72c1edc2f5524e1ee5d1788cecaffd12465b13","externalIds":{"MAG":"1248647435","DOI":"10.3923/JMS.2013.621.634","CorpusId":"75901777"},"title":"Modification of Kampmann A5 as Potential Fusion Inhibitor of Dengue Virus using Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Approach","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5613,"details":{"paperId":"ae4b02eb399248f42d73f69cee908842e3cb4487","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"5404899","MAG":"2607449506","DOI":"10.1177/1177392817701726","CorpusId":"21440401","PubMed":"28469408"},"title":"Modification of S-Adenosyl-l-Homocysteine as Inhibitor of Nonstructural Protein 5 Methyltransferase Dengue Virus Through Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation","abstract":"Dengue fever is still a major threat worldwide, approximately threatening two-fifths of the world’s population in tropical and subtropical countries.

In vitro experimental evidences have indicated the preventive, as well as a pathogenicity-enhancing role, of preexisting DENV antibodies in ZIKV infections. ADE has been confirmed in DENV but not ZIKV infections. Principally, the Fc region of the anti-DENV antibody binds with the fragment crystallizable gamma receptor (FcγR), and subsequent C1q interactions and immune effector functions are responsible for the ADE. In contrast to normal DENV infections, with ADE in DENV infections, inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and a reduction in IRF-1 gene expression, NOS2 levels, and RIG-1 and MDA-5 expression levels occurs. FcγRIIA is the most permissive FcγR for DENV-ADE, and under hypoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha transcriptionally enhances expression levels of FcγRIIA, which further enhances ADE.

DEN2 nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) has a serine protease domain (NS3-pro) and requires the hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2BH) for activation. NS3 is also an RNA-stimulated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase)/RNA helicase and a 5′-RNA triphosphatase (RTPase). In this study the first biochemical and kinetic properties of full-length NS3 (NS3FL)-associated NTPase, RTPase, and RNA helicase are presented. The NS3FL showed an enhanced RNA helicase activity compared with the NS3-pro-minus NS3, which was further enhanced by the presence of the NS2BH (NS2BH-NS3FL). An active protease catalytic triad is not required for the stimulatory effect, suggesting that the overall folding of the N-terminal protease domain contributes to this enhancement.

In recent decades, a steady increase in the number of severe dengue cases has been seen. Severe dengue disease is most often observed in individuals that have pre‐existing immunity against heterotypic dengue subtypes and in infants with low levels of maternal dengue antibodies. The generally accepted hypothesis explaining the immunopathogenesis of severe dengue is called antibody‐dependent enhancement of dengue infection. Here, circulating antibodies bind to the newly infecting virus but do not neutralize infection. Rather, these antibodies increase the infected cell mass and virus production. Additionally, antiviral responses are diminished allowing massive virus particle production early in infection. The large infected cell mass and the high viral load are prelude for severe disease development.

Because most cases of DHF/DSS occur in patients with secondary DENV infection, anti-DENV antibodies are generally considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Previously, we have found that antithrombin antibodies (ATAs) with both antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities are present in the sera of dengue patients. However, the mechanism by which these autoantibodies are induced is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that antibodies induced by DENV immunization in mice and rabbits could bind to DENV antigens as well as to human thrombin and plasminogen (Plg). The binding of anti-DENV antibodies to thrombin and Plg was inhibited by preadsorption with DENV nonstructural protein 1. In addition, affinity-purified ATAs from DENV-immunized rabbit sera could inhibit thrombin activity and enhance Plg activation both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that molecular mimicry between DENV and coagulation factors can induce the production of autoantibodies with biological effects similar to those of ATAs found in dengue patients. These coagulation-factor cross-reactive anti-DENV antibodies can interfere with the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis, which may lead to the tendency of DHF/DSS patients to bleed. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in tropical and subtropical areas. Over 50 million DENV infection cases develop each year, and more than 2.5 billion people are at risk of dengue-induced hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Currently, there is no vaccine or drug treatment for DENV. In the present study, we demonstrated that DENV immunization could induce thrombin and plasminogen (Plg) cross-reactive antibodies, which were able to inhibit thrombin activity and enhance Plg activation. These results suggest that molecular mimicry between DENV antigens, thrombin, and Plg may elicit antibodies that disturb hemostasis. The selection of appropriate candidate antigens for use in DENV vaccines should prevent these potentially dangerous autoimmune responses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Molecular mimicry between DENV antigens, thrombin, and Plg may elicit antibodies that disturb hemostasis, and coagulation factors can induce the production of autoantibodies with biological effects similar to those of ATAs found in dengue patients."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3463,"details":{"paperId":"d37e467b648deebf54659ed730feb44717c7387c","externalIds":{"MAG":"2118915833","DOI":"10.1074/jbc.M110.170993","CorpusId":"205304939","PubMed":"21233208"},"title":"Molecular Mimicry of Human Endothelial Cell Antigen by Autoantibodies to Nonstructural Protein 1 of Dengue Virus*","abstract":"The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), both serious complications of dengue virus (DV) infection, remains unclear. In this study, we found that anti-DV NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) polyclonal antibodies cross-reacted with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We further identified a complex-specific mAb, DB16-1, which could recognize DV NS1 and cross-react with HUVECs and human blood vessels. The target protein of DB16-1 was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. LC-MS/MS analysis and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that the target protein of DB16-1 was human LYRIC (lysine-rich CEACAM1 co-isolated). Our newly generated anti-LYRIC mAbs bound to HUVECs in a pattern similar to that of DB16-1. The B-cell epitope of DB16-1 displayed a consensus motif, Lys-X-Trp-Gly (KXWG), which corresponded to amino acid residues 116–119 of DV NS1 and mimicked amino acid residues 334–337 in LYRIC. Moreover, the binding activity of DB16-1 in NS1 of DV-2 and in LYRIC disappeared after the KXWG epitope was deleted in each. In conclusion, DB16-1 targeted the same epitope in DV NS1 and LYRIC protein on human endothelial cells, suggesting that it might play a role in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS.

These findings provide direct clinical evidence for the theory of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE), which postulates that sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies facilitate the invasion of host cells by the dengue virus. Here, we carried out molecular simulations guided by previous in vitro experiments and structural studies to explore the role of antibody fine-specificity, viral conformation, and maturation state—key aspects of dengue virology that are difficult to manipulate experimentally—on ADE in the context of primary and secondary infections. Our simulation results reproduced in vitro studies of ADE, providing a molecular basis for how sub-neutralizing antibody concentrations can enhance infection. We found that antibody fine specificity, or the relative antibody response to different epitopes on the surface of the dengue virus, plays a major role in determining the degree of ADE observed at low antibody concentrations. Specifically, we found that the higher the relative antibody response to certain cross-reactive epitopes, such as the fusion loop or prM, the greater was the range of antibody concentrations where ADE occurred, providing a basis for why low antibody concentrations are associated with severe dengue disease in secondary infections.

The molecular docking results presented the 2-D structures of bioactive complex, which interacted with especially conserved residues of target domains. Interestingly, we find the Catechin, Laurifolin, Cianidanol have highest binding energy against NS4B in DENV-1,2,4 which is evident by the formation of more hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues at the binding site of the receptor. Our results revealed that the bioactive compound, especially Catechin has significant anti-dengue activities.

Several vaccines have been developed against the disease, but they only prevent the disease and reduce the risk of death. Consequently, the antiviral drug becomes the most powerful treatment to solve this problem. The virus possesses a two component NS2B-NS3 protease that cleaves viral precursor proteins, and therefore represents a target for the development of antiviral drugs. In many researches, several models of peptides inhibitor were generated in complexes with the NS2B-NS3 DENV2 protease by performing molecular docking. The goal of this research was to study the interaction of ligands as inhibitors for protein (enzyme) in solvent explicit condition by performing molecular dynamics simulation at 300 and 312 K. The simulations were performed on four disulfide cyclic tripeptide ligands (RGR, KRK, RRA and RKR) and two proline-proline based cyclic peptide ligands (RKK and KKR) compared with linear peptide inhibitor Bz-Nle-K-R-R-H as standard ligand. The results provide conformational changes of enzyme-inhibitor complex that is shown by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values. These results show that dynamic behavior of the complex occurs in the presence of solvent. The interaction between ligand and amino acid residue of enzyme changed during simulation. By these parameters, RKR becomes the best ligand compared with others. The ligand has hydrogen bond interaction with the residue of active side, and is stable during simulation at both temperatures. In conclusion, RKR ligand is proposed as an antiviral drug by performing molecular dynamics simulation.

The major factors for spread of dengue virus includes progression of virus, proliferation of climate dependent vectors, unplanned urbanization and increasing socioeconomic development.2 The virus is a single stranded RNA belonging to genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae, consisting of four serotypes DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4 which causes dengue fever (DF).

In most of the dengue cases the individuals are infected but show no symptoms. The viral genome encodes for three structural proteins viz capsid [C], envelope [E] and precursor membrane [prM]).

Although Aedes mosquitoes transmit DENV when probing for blood in the skin, no information exists on DENV infection and immune response in the dermis, where the blood vessels are found. DENV suppresses the interferon response, replicates, and causes disease in humans but not wild-type mice. Here, we used mice lacking the interferon-α/β receptor (Ifnar –/–), which had normal cell populations in the skin and were susceptible to intradermal DENV infection, to investigate the dynamics of early DENV infection of immune cells in the skin. CD103+ classical dendritic cells (cDCs), Ly6C– CD11b+ cDCs, and macrophages in the steady-state dermis were initial targets of DENV infection 12-24 hours post-inoculation but then decreased in frequency. We demonstrated recruitment of adoptively-transferred Ly6Chigh monocytes from wild-type and Ifnar –/– origin to the DENV-infected dermis and differentiation to Ly6C+ CD11b+ monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), which became DENV-infected after 48 hours, and were then the major targets for virus replication. Ly6Chigh monocytes that entered the DENV-infected dermis expressed chemokine receptor CCR2, likely mediating recruitment. Further, we show that ∼100-fold more hematopoietic cells in the dermis were DENV-infected compared to Langerhans cells in the epidermis. Overall, these results identify the dermis as the main site of early DENV replication and show that DENV infection in the skin occurs in two waves: initial infection of resident cDCs and macrophages, followed by infection of monocytes and moDCs that are recruited to the dermis.

A distinct feature of dengue is the increased risk for severe disease in some individuals with preexisting DENV-specific immunity. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which poorly-neutralizing IgG antibodies from a prior infection opsonize DENV to increase infection of Fc gamma receptor-bearing cells. While IgM and IgG are the most commonly studied DENV-reactive antibody isotypes, our group and others have described the induction of DENV-specific serum IgA responses during dengue. We hypothesized that monomeric IgA would be able to neutralize DENV without the possibility of ADE. To test this, we synthesized IgG and IgA versions of two different DENV-reactive monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that isotype-switching does not affect the antigen binding and neutralization properties of the two mAbs. We show that DENV-reactive IgG, but not IgA, mediates ADE in an Fc gamma receptor-positive K562 cells. Furthermore, we show that IgA potently antagonizes the ADE activity of IgG.

Importantly, many of these genetically similar viruses co-circulate within the same geographic regions, making it likely for individuals living in areas of high flavivirus endemicity to be infected with multiple flaviviruses during their lifetime. Following a flavivirus infection, a robust virus-specific T cell response is generated and the memory recall of this response has been demonstrated to provide long-lasting immunity, protecting against reinfection with the same pathogen. However, multiple studies have shown that this flavivirus specific T cell response can be cross-reactive and active during heterologous flavivirus infection, leading to the question: How does immunity to one flavivirus shape immunity to the next, and how does this impact disease? It has been proposed that in some cases unfavorable disease outcomes may be caused by lower avidity cross-reactive memory T cells generated during a primary flavivirus infection that preferentially expand during a secondary heterologous infection and function sub optimally against the new pathogen. While in other cases, these cross-reactive cells still have the potential to facilitate cross-protection.

In this review, we discuss the potential strengths and limitations of existing mouse models of dengue disease.

In contrast, in mice, the conditions of infection are well defined and a large number of experimental parameters can be varied at will. Therefore, mouse models offer an opportunity to experimentally test hypotheses that are based on epidemiological observations. In particular, gain-of-function or loss-of-function models can be established to assess how different components of the immune system (either alone or in combination) contribute to protection or pathogenesis during secondary infections or after vaccination. In addition, mouse models have been used for pre-clinical testing of anti-viral drugs or for vaccine development studies.

Individual T-cell clones recognized epitopes on the dengue virus pre-M, E, NSl/NS2A, and NS3 proteins and were restricted by the I-Ad, I-Ed, Ld, and Kd antigens. Both serotype-specific and serotype-cross-reactive clones were isolated in the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets; among CD8+ clones, those that recognized the dengue virus structural proteins were serotype specific whereas those that recognized the nonstructural proteins were serotype cross-reactive. All of the CD8+ and one of five CD4+ clones lysed dengue virus-infected target cells. Using synthetic peptides, we identified an Ld-restricted epitope on the E protein (residues 331 to 339, SPCKIPFEI) and a Kd-restricted epitope on the NS3 protein (residues 296 to 310, ARGYISTRVEM GEAA). These data parallel previous findings of studies using human dengue virus-specific T-cell clones. This experimental mouse system may be useful for studying the role of the virus serotype and HLA haplotype on T-cell responses after primary dengue virus infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The target epitopes, serotype specificity, and cytolytic function of dengue virus-specific T cells may influence their theoretical roles in protection against secondary infection as well as the immunopathogenesis of d Dengue hemorrhagic fever."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6501,"details":{"paperId":"3dc1df5f3488a3a0c228d1d844944c3362598850","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4468182","MAG":"628915033","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0130083","CorpusId":"11387243","PubMed":"26075394"},"title":"Murine Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of the Flaviviral NS5 Capping Enzyme 2-Thioxothiazolidin-4-One Inhibitor BG-323","abstract":"Arthropod-borne flavivirus infection continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of drug targets and novel antiflaviviral compounds to treat these diseases has become a global health imperative. A previous screen of 235,456 commercially available small molecules identified the 2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one family of compounds as inhibitors of the flaviviral NS5 capping enzyme, a promising target for antiviral drug development. Rational drug design methodologies enabled identification of lead compound BG-323 from this series. We have shown previously that BG-323 potently inhibits NS5 capping enzyme activity, displays antiviral effects in dengue virus replicon assays and inhibits growth of West Nile and yellow fever viruses with low cytotoxicity in vitro. In this study we further characterized BG-323’s antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. We found that BG-323 was able to reduce replication of WNV (NY99) and Powassan viruses in culture, and we were unable to force resistance into WNV (Kunjin) in long-term culture experiments. We then evaluated the antiviral activity of BG-323 in a murine model. Mice were challenged with WNV NY99 and administered BG-323 or mock by IP inoculation immediately post challenge and twice daily thereafter. Mice were bled and viremia was quantified on day three. No significant differences in viremia were observed between BG-323-treated and control groups and clinical scores indicated both BG-323-treated and control mice developed signs of illness on approximately the same day post challenge. To determine whether differences in in vitro and in vivo efficacy were due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of BG-323, we conducted a pharmacokinetic evaluation of this small molecule. Insights from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that BG-323 is cell permeable, has a low efflux ratio and does not significantly inhibit two common cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) isoforms thus suggesting this molecule may be less likely to cause adverse drug interactions. However, the T1/2 of BG-323 was suboptimal and the percent of drug bound to plasma binding proteins was high. Future studies with BG-323 will be aimed at increasing the T1/2 and determining strategies for mitigating the effects of high plasma protein binding, which likely contribute to low in vivo efficacy.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"BG-323’s antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo was characterized and it was found that BG-323 was able to reduce replication of WNV (NY99) and Powassan viruses in culture, and the molecule was unable to force resistance into W NV (Kunjin) in long-term culture experiments."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3580,"details":{"paperId":"ab8fc1eb1b0458b692182184bc99e9d7e224df64","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1080/17460441.2022.2033205","CorpusId":"246428375","PubMed":"35098849"},"title":"Murine models of dengue virus infection for novel drug discovery","abstract":"ABSTRACT Introduction Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of the most prevalent human disease transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.

Sequence comparisons indicated that much of the 12-amino-acid sequence extending from position 386 to 397 of the DEN2 envelope glycoprotein (E) previously thought to represent the DEN2-specific mab 3H5 binding site was also present in some dengue type 1, 3, or 4 virus strains. However, the region occupied by the Glu-Pro-Gly sequence at upstream positions 383 to 385 was completely conserved among DEN2 strains, but divergent in other serotype viruses, suggesting that this sequence might be part of the antigenic site of mab 3H5. We investigated this possibility by employing the previously constructed chimeric DEN2(PreM-E)/DEN4 cDNA clone to produce viable mutants bearing DEN2 PreM and E sequences that could be analyzed for binding to and neutralization by mab 3H5. We constructed 13 such DEN2 mutants that contained a single amino acid substitution in the region between positions 383 and 393 of DEN2 E. Each single substitution in the region spanning positions 386 through 393 of DEN2 yielded a virus that was as reactive with mab 3H5 as the parental chimeric virus. These results are consistent with the extent of sequence conservation in the region. In contrast, 5 of 6 mutants that sustained an amino acid substitution at position 383, 384, or 385 failed to react with mab 3H5 as detected by immunofluorescence assay and failed to be neutralized by the mab. Interestingly, each of the 5 mab-resistant DEN2 mutants also exhibited reduced mouse neurovirulence compared to parental chimeric DEN2 when inoculated intracerebrally. These observations suggest that the Glu-Pro-Gly sequence at positions 383-386 of the DEN2 E is a component of the site against which mab 3H5 is directed.

Recent studies indicate that tetravalent DENV vaccines must induce balanced, serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies to achieve durable protective immunity against all 4 serotypes. With the leading live attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccines, it has been difficult to achieve balanced and type-specific responses to each serotype, most likely because of unbalanced replication of vaccine viral strains.

Currently, there is no effective antiviral therapy or vaccine against DENV infection. Methods In order to identify potential antiviral agents against DENV, we performed high-throughput cell-based screening on a highly purified natural products library. Among the screening hits, selected compounds which displayed 50–75% inhibition against DENV2 were validated using secondary assays. Time-of-addition studies, dose-dependent assays, real time quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, Western blot and ultrastructural imaging were conducted in an attempt to elucidate the potential antiviral mechanisms of narasin. Results In this study, an ionophore, narasin was selected for detailed analysis due to its strong inhibitory profile against DENV infection with minimal cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration >1,000 μM). A dose- dependent study revealed narasin to have an 50% inhibitory concentration of less than 1 μM against all four serotypes of DENV. Time-of-addition studies of narasin-treated, DENV2- infected Huh-7 cells suggested narasin to be involved in inhibiting the post-entry stages of viral replication during DENV infection. Proteomic and ultrastructural analyses revealed the antiviral mechanism of narasin as likely to be associated with the disruption of viral protein synthesis. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR studies showed no differences in viral RNA levels between narasin- treated and control DENV2-infected cells.

These virus-antibody complexes can then attach to a Fc gamma receptor-bearing cell, via the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin, resulting in an increased number of infected cells. ADE may be responsible in part for the most severe clinical manifestations of dengue virus infection which include haemorrhage and shock. Three classes of human Fc gamma receptors exist, Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII. In this study, we examined the effects of neuraminidase on ADE of dengue virus infection mediated by the low-affinity Fc gamma RII. K562 cells, which express only Fc gamma RII, treated with neuraminidase resulted in augmentation of ADE of dengue virus infection by human anti-dengue antibodies. This augmented ADE of infection could be blocked by anti-Fc gamma RII monoclonal antibody IV.3. Incubation of neuraminidase-treated K562 cells with IgG-coated human red blood cells resulted in an increase in the percentage of rosette formations compared with the untreated K562 cells. A bispecific antibody directed against Fc gamma RII and dengue virus (IV.3 x 2H2) enhanced virus infection. Neuraminidase also augmented ADE mediated by this antibody, but to a much lesser degree (by 50%) compared with that seen using conventional human anti-dengue antibody (by 200 to 300%). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of neuraminidase-treated K562 cells showed that the number of Fc gamma RII-specific antibodies that bind to Fc gamma RII increases by 15 to 20% after treatment with neuraminidase.

The two points under discussion are antibodies conferring sterilizing immunity by neutralizing the virus inoculum or protection against the development of disease without complete inhibition of virus replication. For tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a flavivirus, transfer of neutralizing antibodies specific for envelope glycoprotein E protected mice from subsequent TBEV challenge. Nevertheless, short-term, low-level virus replication was detected in these mice. Furthermore, mice that were exposed to replicating but not to inactivated virus while passively protected developed active immunity to TBEV rechallenge. Despite the priming of TBEV-specific cytotoxic T cells, adoptive transfer of serum but not of T cells conferred immunity upon naive recipient mice. These transferred sera were not neutralizing and were predominantly specific for NS1, a nonstructural TBEV protein which is expressed in and on infected cells and which is also secreted from these cells. Results of these experiments showed that despite passive protection by neutralizing antibodies, limited virus replication occurs, indicating protection from disease rather than sterilizing immunity.

New information, particularly on structures, location and mechanisms of action of established protein targets have been reported. There have also been studies on repurposing known drugs as templates for targeting flavivirus proteins and these hits could be promising templates for developing new more potent inhibitors.

We emphasize the need for stepped-up efforts to stop further spread and intensification of these infections worldwide. Recent findings Although the incidence and geographic distribution of flavivirus diseases have increased in recent years, human vaccines are available only for yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis and Kyasanur forest disease. Factors contributing to resurgence include insufficient supplies of available vaccines, incomplete vaccination coverage and relaxation in vector control. Research has been underway for 60 years to develop effective vaccines against dengue, and recent progress is encouraging. The development of vaccines against West Nile, virus recently introduced to North America, has been initiated. In addition, there is considerable interest in improving existing vaccines with respect to increasing safety (e.g. eliminating the newly recognized syndrome of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic adverse disease), and to reducing the cost and number of doses required for effective immunization. Summary Traditional approaches to flavivirus vaccines are still employed, while recent advancements in biotechnology produced new approaches to vaccine design, such as recombinant live virus, subunit and DNA vaccines. Live chimeric vaccines against dengue, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile based on yellow fever 17D virus (ChimeriVax) are in phase I/II trials, with encouraging results. Other chimeric dengue, tick-borne encephalitis and West Nile virus candidates were developed based on attenuated dengue backbones.

Here, we report four structurally attractive diterpene–alkaloid conjugates polyalongarins A–D (1–4), clerodane-containing aporphine and proaporphine alkaloids, the first of its kind from the barks of Taiwanese Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.) Thwaites var. pendula. In addition to conventional spectroscopic analysis, single crystal X-ray crystallography was employed to determine the chemical structures and stereo-configurations of 1. Compounds 1–4 were subsequently subjected to in vitro antiviral examination against DENV2 by evaluating the expression level of the NS2B protein in DENV2-infected Huh-7 cells. These compounds display encouraging anti-DENV2 activity with superb EC50 (2.8–6.4 μM) and CC50 values (50.4–200 μM). The inhibitory mechanism of 1–4 on NS2B was further explored drawing on in-silico molecular docking analysis. Based on calculated binding affinities and predicted interactions between the functional groups of 1–4 and the allosteric-site residues of the DENV2 NS2B-NS3 protease, our analysis concludes that the clerodane–aporphine/proaporphine-type hybrids are novel and effective DENV NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitors.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Four structurally attractive diterpene–alkaloid conjugates polyalongarins A–D (1–4), clerodane-containing aporphine and proaporphine alkaloids, the first of its kind from the barks of Taiwanese Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.)

BP2109 inhibited DENV (serotypes 1 to 4), but not Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), replication and viral RNA synthesis without detectable cytotoxicity. The compound inhibited recombinant DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 15.43 ± 2.12 μM and reduced the reporter expression of the DENV-2 replicon with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.17 ± 0.01 μM.

The introduction of R55K and E80K double mutations into the dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease and a dengue virus replicon construct conferred 10.3- and 73.8-fold resistance to BP2109, respectively. The E80K mutation was further determined to be the key mutation conferring dengue virus replicon resistance (61.3-fold) to BP2109, whereas the R55K mutation alone did not affect resistance to BP2109.

In this work two novel CPPs, pepR and pepM, designed from two domains of the dengue virus (DENV) capsid protein, were studied for their ability to deliver nucleic acids into cells as non‐covalently bound cargo. Translocation studies were performed by confocal microscopy in HepG2, BHK and HEK cell lineages, astrocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Combined studies in HepG2 cells, astrocytes and BHK cells, at 4 and 37 °C or using specific endocytosis inhibitors, revealed that pepR and pepM use distinct internalization routes: pepM translocates lipid membranes directly, while pepR uses an endocytic pathway. To confirm these results, a methodology was developed to monitor the translocation kinetics of both peptides by real‐time flow cytometry. Kinetic constants were determined, and the amount of nucleic acids delivered was estimated. Additional studies were performed in order to understand the molecular bases of the peptide‐mediated translocation. Peptide–nucleic acid and peptide–lipid membrane interactions were studied quantitatively based on the intrinsic fluorescence of the peptides. pepR and pepM bound ssDNA to the same extent. Partition studies revealed that both peptides bind preferentially to anionic lipid membranes, adopting an α‐helical conformation. However, fluorescence quenching studies suggest that pepM is deeply inserted into the lipid bilayer, in contrast with pepR. Moreover, only pepM is able to promote the fusion and aggregation of vesicles composed of zwitterionic lipids. Altogether, the results show that DENV capsid protein derived peptides serve as good templates for novel CPP‐based nucleic acid delivery strategies, defining different routes for cell entry.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results show that DENV capsid protein derived peptides serve as good templates for novel CPP‐based nucleic acid delivery strategies, defining different routes for cell entry."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7286,"details":{"paperId":"36a25f24ab7b578629de8af5ee8d0799df969624","externalIds":{"MAG":"95601165","DOI":"10.2741/2769","CorpusId":"41598372","PubMed":"17981637"},"title":"Nucleic acid-based inhibition of flavivirus infections.","abstract":"The genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae consists of many arthropod-transmitted human pathogens, including dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses.

To date, there is no drug for the treatment of dengue-associated disease. Nucleosides are effective antivirals and work by inhibiting the accurate replication of the viral genome. Nucleobases offer a cheaper alternative to nucleosides for broad antiviral applications. Metabolic activation of nucleobases involves condensation with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to give the corresponding nucleoside-5’-monophosphate. This could provide an alternative to phosphorylation of a nucleoside, a step that is often rate limiting and inefficient in activation of nucleosides. We evaluated more than 30 nucleobases and corresponding nucleosides for their antiviral activity against dengue virus. Five nucleobases and two nucleosides were found to induce potent antiviral effects not previously described. Our studies further revealed that nucleobases were usually more active with a better tissue culture therapeutic index than their corresponding nucleosides. The development of viral lethal mutagenesis, an antiviral approach that takes into account the quasispecies behavior of RNA viruses, represents an exciting prospect not yet studied in the context of dengue replication. Passage of the virus in the presence of the nucleobase 3a (T-1105) and corresponding nucleoside 3b (T-1106), favipiravir derivatives, induced an increase in apparent mutations, indicating lethal mutagenesis as a possible antiviral mechanism.

During dengue virus maturation, spiky, immature, noninfectious virions change their structure to form smooth-surfaced particles in the slightly acidic environment of the trans-Golgi network, thereby allowing cellular furin to cleave the precursor-membrane proteins. The dengue virions become fully infectious when they release the cleaved precursor peptide upon reaching the neutral-pH environment of the extracellular space. Here we report on the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the immature virus complexed with the 2H2 antigen binding fragments (Fab) at different concentrations and under various pH conditions. At neutral pH and a high concentration of Fab molecules, three Fab molecules bind to three precursor-membrane proteins on each spike of the immature virus. However, at a low concentration of Fab molecules and pH 7.0, only two Fab molecules bind to each spike. Changing to a slightly acidic pH caused no detectable change of structure for the sample with a high Fab concentration but caused severe structural damage to the low-concentration sample. Therefore, the 2H2 Fab inhibits the maturation process of immature dengue virus when Fab molecules are present at a high concentration, because the three Fab molecules on each spike hold the precursor-membrane molecules together, thereby inhibiting the normal conformational change that occurs during maturation.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the immature virus complexed with the 2H2 antigen binding fragments (Fab) at different concentrations and under various pH conditions inhibit the maturation process of immature dengue virus when Fab molecules are present at a high concentration."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7851,"details":{"paperId":"b543d66aa9798e745faf17e23a1ac0d7aad8b558","externalIds":{"MAG":"3086463772","PubMedCentral":"7551155","DOI":"10.3390/v12091022","CorpusId":"214793527","PubMed":"32933138"},"title":"Old Drugs with New Tricks: Efficacy of Fluoroquinolones to Suppress Replication of Flaviviruses","abstract":"Antiviral therapies are urgently needed to treat infections with flaviviruses such as Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) virus. Repurposing FDA-approved compounds could provide the fastest route to alleviate the burden of flaviviral diseases. In this study, three fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, difloxacin and ciprofloxacin, curtailed replication of flaviviruses ZIKV, DENV, Langat (LGTV) and Modoc (MODV) in HEK-293 cells at low micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition assays revealed that enoxacin suppressed ZIKV replication when added at 6 hours post-infection, suggesting inhibition of an intermediate step in the virus life cycle, whereas ciprofloxacin and difloxacin had a wider window of efficacy of 2, 6, and 8 hours post-infection for difloxacin and 2 to 8 hours post-infection for ciprofloxacin. The efficacy of enoxacin to suppress ZIKV replication in 5-week-old A129 mice was evaluated in two experiments. First, mice were infected with 1×105 plaque-forming units (pfu) ZIKV FSS13025 (n=20) or PBS (n=11) on day 0 and subsets were treated with enoxacin at 10mg/kg or 15mg/kg or diluent orally twice daily on days 1-5. Treated and control mice did not differ in weight change or virus titer in serum or brain. Mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls. Second, mice were infected with 1×102 pfu ZIKV (n=13) or PBS (n=13) on day 0 and subsets were treated with 15mg/kg oral enoxacin or diluent twice daily on days 0 (pre-treatment) and 1-5. Mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 2.5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls, while weight and viral load in the serum, brain, and liver did not differ between treated and control mice. Enoxacin efficacy in cultured murine Sertoli cells was not enhanced compared to efficacy in HEK-293 cells. ZIKV can be sexually transmitted, so reduction of titer in the testes by enoxacin should be further investigated. Author Summary Flaviviruses such as Zika and dengue virus pose a significant threat to public health worldwide, and there are currently no antiviral therapies to treat any flaviviral infection. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs as anti-flaviviral therapies can accelerate clinical use. We demonstrated that fluoroquinolone antibiotics exhibit anti-flaviviral efficacy, suppressing flavivirus replication in cultured human cells. Additionally, we found that the fluoroquinolone enoxacin suppressed Zika virus replication in mouse testes. While Zika virus is primarily transmitted via mosquitoes, the virus also undergoes sexual transmission. The importance of sexual transmission for the overall epidemiology of the virus remains unclear; nonetheless all routes of potential transmission to pregnant women are of concern as fetal infection in utero can have devastating effects. Thus, our data indicate that fluoroquinolones hold promise for treatment of flaviviral infections, particularly infection of the testes by Zika virus, and that this class of drugs warrants further study.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data indicate that fluoroquinolones hold promise for treatment of flaviviral infections, particularly infection of the testes by Zika virus, and that this class of drugs warrants further study."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":745,"details":{"paperId":"50a3ed0e6d299371adff7b4662c47c2a13b4c456","externalIds":{"MAG":"2744257501","DOI":"10.1007/s12033-017-0029-4","CorpusId":"31313246","PubMed":"28791613"},"title":"Oleic acid Enhances Dengue Virus But Not Dengue Virus-Like Particle Production from Mammalian Cells","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results suggest that further optimization of DENV VLP expression is possible, but it will require more understanding of how native DENV infection remodels the host cell machinery."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1097,"details":{"paperId":"76d07f85dd815cc4da467986b82963296580a99f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2078414620","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.02.011","CorpusId":"205573445","PubMed":"21371507"},"title":"Oligomeric procyanidins stimulate innate antiviral immunity in dengue virus infected human PBMCs.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The capacity of O PCs to increase sensitivity to IFN I could be broadly applicable to many viral infections and two separate antiviral mechanisms suggest that OPCs may represent a novel, robust antiviral therapy."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7739,"details":{"paperId":"e5549e187e2d21d2851e4320b6fa2624699a8892","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7918374","DOI":"10.3390/molecules26040956","CorpusId":"232086530","PubMed":"33670247"},"title":"Oligonucleotide-Based Approaches to Inhibit Dengue Virus Replication","abstract":"Dengue fever is one of the most common viral infections affecting humans.

An effective dengue vaccine requires generation of strong and balanced neutralizing antibodies against all four antigenically distinct serotypes of DENV. The leading live-attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine platform has shown partial efficacy, with an unbalanced response across the four serotypes in clinical trials. DENV subunit vaccine platforms are being developed because they provide a strong safety profile and are expected to avoid the unbalanced immunization issues associated with live multivalent vaccines. Subunit vaccines often lack immunogenicity, requiring either a particulate or adjuvanted formulation. Particulate formulations adsorbing monomeric DENV-E antigen to the particle surface incite a strong immune response, but have no control of antigen presentation. Highly neutralizing epitopes are displayed by DENV-E quaternary structures. To control the display of DENV-E and produce quaternary structures, particulate formulations that covalently attach DENV-E to the particle surface are needed. Here we develop a surface attached DENV2-E particulate formulation, as well as analysis tools, using PEG hydrogel nanoparticles created with particle replication in nonwetting templates (PRINT) technology.

Of >70 known TRIMs, TRIM56 inhibits replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a ruminant pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, but has no appreciable effect on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus. Yet the antiviral spectrum of TRIM56 remains undefined. In particular, how TRIM56 impacts human-pathogenic viruses is unknown. Also unclear are the molecular determinants governing the antiviral activities of TRIM56. Herein, we show that TRIM56 poses a barrier to infections by yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and human coronavirus virus (HCoV) OC43 but not encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Moreover, by engineering cell lines conditionally expressing various TRIM56 mutants, we demonstrated that TRIM56's antiflavivirus effects required both the E3 ligase activity that lies in the N-terminal RING domain and the integrity of its C-terminal portion, while the restriction of HCoV-OC43 relied upon the TRIM56 E3 ligase activity alone. Furthermore, TRIM56 was revealed to impair YFV and DENV2 propagation by suppressing intracellular viral RNA accumulation but to compromise HCoV-OC43 infection at a later step in the viral life cycle, suggesting that distinct TRIM56 domains accommodate differing antiviral mechanisms. Altogether, TRIM56 is a versatile antiviral host factor that confers resistance to YFV, DENV2, and HCoV-OC43 through overlapping and distinct molecular determinants. IMPORTANCE We previously reported tripartite motif protein 56 (TRIM56) as a host restriction factor of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a ruminant pathogen. However, the impact of TRIM56 on human-pathogenic RNA viruses is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that TRIM56 restricts two medically important flaviviruses, yellow fever virus (YFV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and a human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, but not encephalomyocarditis virus, a picornavirus. Further, we show that TRIM56-mediated inhibition of HCoV-OC43 multiplication depends solely on its E3 ligase activity, whereas its restriction of YFV and DENV2 requires both the E3 ligase activity and integrity of the C-terminal portion. The differing molecular determinants appear to accommodate distinct antiviral mechanisms TRIM56 adopts to target different families of viruses; while TRIM56 curbs intracellular YFV/DENV2 RNA replication, it acts at a later step in HCoV-OC43 life cycle. These novel findings illuminate the molecular basis of the versatility and specificity of TRIM56's antiviral activities against positive-strand RNA viruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Tripartite motif protein 56 (TRIM56) is a versatile antiviral host factor that confers resistance to YFV, DENV2, and HCoV-OC43 through overlapping and distinct molecular determinants."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7412,"details":{"paperId":"b77b4bb9cc2ec49ac7ed9accf9e1ad366128a752","externalIds":{"MAG":"2991788945","DOI":"10.33591/sfp.44.2.u5","CorpusId":"199417584"},"title":"Overview of Dengue and Dengvaxia®—Optimising the use of Dengvaxia® in clinical practice","abstract":"e clinical development programme of Dengvaxia® has been robust, with about 25 clinical studies (5 phase I, 14 phase II and 6 phase III studies) conducted in more than 40,000 subjects across 15 countries.19,20 Early phase I/II clinical trials, including the phase II CYD28 trial conducted in Singapore, showed a balanced immune response of the vaccine against the 4 DENV serotypes after 3 doses and a safety/reactogenicity pro le comparable to the control vaccines.15,21,22 In the CYD28 trial (n=1198), it was also noted that a vaccination schedule of 3 doses must be completed for attaining adequate geometric mean neutralising antibody titres (GMTs); the attained mean GMT titres were stable for up to 4 years of follow-up.22","publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The clinical development programme of Dengvaxia® has been robust, with about 25 clinical studies conducted in more than 40,000 subjects across 15 countries and a balanced immune response of the vaccine against the 4 DENV serotypes after 3 doses and a safety/reactogenicity comparable to the control vaccines."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6998,"details":{"paperId":"59c7d577b7fab625d7555d4df6a29d78708686f4","externalIds":{"MAG":"1572685088","DOI":"10.18433/J3401K","CorpusId":"15163059","PubMed":"22202223"},"title":"Overview of plant-derived vaccine antigens: Dengue virus.","abstract":"This review highlights the advantages and current status of plant-derived vaccine development with special reference to the dengue virus.

The challenge of discovering an efficient vaccine is enhanced by the surplus presence of efficient vectors and drug resistance from the virus. For centuries, papaya (Carica papaya) extracts have been traditionally used to treat DF, DHF, and DSS. In the present study, we systematically investigated seven compounds isolated from papaya leaf extract with regard to their potential as inhibitors for non-structural (NS) proteins, NS3 and NS5, which play a crucial role in viral RNA replication. The computational tools applied stretched across classical molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and SwissADME used to calculate binding affinities; binding free energies; Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME); and drug-likeness properties, thus, identifying Kaempferol, Chlorogenic acid, and Quercetin as potential candidates, with Kaempferol and Quercetin scoring best. Therefore, for the Kaempferol and Quercetin complexes, hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) geometry and frequency calculations were performed, followed by the local mode analysis developed in our group to quantify Kaempferol-NS and Quercetin-NS hydrogen bonding. Given the non-toxic nature and the wide availability of the Kaempferol and Quercetin papaya extract in almost all of the susceptible regions, and our results showing high NS3 and NS5 binding affinities and energies, strong hydrogen bonding with both NS3 and NS5, and excellent ADME properties, we suggest Kaempferol and Quercetin as a strong NS3 and NS5 inhibitor to be further investigated in vitro.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Seven compounds isolated from papaya leaf extract are systematically investigated with regard to their potential as inhibitors for non-structural (NS) proteins, NS3 and NS5, which play a crucial role in viral RNA replication."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8672,"details":{"paperId":"341da62bb8fb8cd11574d2202fddb414cc2394af","externalIds":{"MAG":"2336459851","DOI":"10.7324/JAPS.2016.60327","CorpusId":"20422519"},"title":"Papaya leaves juice as an alternative treatment for dengue fever","abstract":"Dengue Fever (DF), a type of viral disease, is now almost an endemic to certain tropical and subtropical regions of the world.

According to Dengue Situation Update (Number 474) by World Health Organization, as on September 12, 2015, there were 85,488 dengue cases with 234 deaths reported in Malaysia for the year 2015. This is 21.5% higher compared to the same period in 2014 which is 70,337 cases. Dengue fever is transmitted by female Aedes aegypti mosquito carrying Flavivirus. The person who has been infected with dengue fever could be reinfected because the virus carries four different serotypes (Ahmad et al., 2011; Kadir et al., 2013). After being bitten, it would take three to fourteen days for early manifestation of symptoms such as fever, headache, rash, nausea, joint and musculosketel pain. If left untreated, it can cause blood plasma and vessel leakage, dropping of platelet count leading to dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) (Kadir et al., 2013; Pigili et al., 2014). Further severe development of DHF will lead to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) which is associated with high mortality rate (Kadir et al., 2013; Sarala et al., 2014). Currently the newly available dengue vaccine is still not routinely administered to the general public.

Consensus sequence analysis revealed that each of the three viruses, as well as the parental DENV-4 when passaged in FRhL cells, rapidly acquired a single Glu327-Gly substitution in domain III (DIII) of the envelope protein (E). These variants appear to have accumulated in response to growth adaptation to FRhL cells as shown by growth analysis, and the mutation was not detected in the virus following passage in C6/36 cells, primary African green monkey kidney cells, or Vero cells. The Glu327-Gly substitution was predicted by molecular modeling to increase the net positive charge on the surface of E.

Isolated cases were reported until 2007, when the first major outbreaks of Zika infection were reported from the Island of Yap in Micronesia and from French Polynesia in 2013. In 2015, ZIKV started to circulate in Latin America, and in 2016, ZIKV was considered by WHO to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to cases of Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), a ZIKV-associated complication never observed before. After a peak of cases in 2016, the infection incidence dropped dramatically but still causes concern because of the associated microcephaly cases, especially in regions where the dengue virus (DENV) is endemic and co-circulates with ZIKV.

A hydrophobic pocket on the DENV E protein is essential for structural transition in the membrane fusion, and inhibition of this process is able to inhibit DENV infection. To search for a safe anti‐DENV drug, we identified short peptides targeting the hydrophobic pocket by molecular docking.

The rearrangement is believed to proceed by an outward rotation of the E ectodomain after loss of the dimer interface, followed by a reassociation into extended trimers. The ∼55-aa-residue, membrane proximal “stem” can then zip up along domain II, bringing together the transmembrane segments of the C-terminus and the fusion loops at the tip of domain II. We find that peptides derived from the stem of dengue-virus E bind stem-less E trimer, which models a conformational intermediate. In vitro assays demonstrate that these peptides specifically block viral fusion. The peptides inhibit infectivity with potency proportional to their affinity for the conformational intermediate, even when free peptide is removed from a preincubated inoculum before infecting cells. We conclude that peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried with virions into endosomes, the compartment in which acidification initiates fusion. Binding depends on particle dynamics, as there is no inhibition of infectivity if preincubation and separation are at 4°C rather than 37°C. We propose a two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition. Targeting a viral entry pathway can be an effective way to block infection.

This process has been termed antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and has significantly hindered vaccine development. Much of our understanding of this process has come from studies using mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs); however, antibody responses in mice typically exhibit less complexity than those in humans. A better understanding of the humoral immune response to natural dengue virus infection in humans is sorely needed. Using a high-efficiency human hybridoma technology, we isolated 37 hybridomas secreting human MAbs to dengue viruses from 12 subjects years or even decades following primary or secondary infection. The majority of the human antibodies recovered were broadly cross-reactive, directed against either envelope or premembrane proteins, and capable of enhancement of infection in vitro; few exhibited serotype-specific binding or potent neutralizing activity. Memory B cells encoding enhancing antibodies predominated in the circulation, even two or more decades following infection.

Firstly, bacterially expressed EDIII or whole virus particles were used as bait in biopanning against a large naïve human Fab-phage library (>10 billion independent clones). Multiple panning strategies were employed, and in excess of 1000 clones were screened, but all of the antibodies identified bound the envelope in regions outside EDIII suggesting EDIII antibodies are virtually absent from the naïve human repertoire. Next, a chimeric Fab-phage library was constructed from a panel of EDIII specific mouse hybridomas by pooling the VH and VL chain sequences from the hybridomas and cloning these into the pComb3X phagemid vector with human CH and CL encoding sequences.

Lack of therapeutic drugs and vaccines signify that more resources need to be explored. Accumulated evidence has suggested that plants offer a vast reservoir for antiviral drug discovery which are safe for human consumption. Plant-based drug discovery is a complex and time-consuming process as plants possess rich repository of chemically diverse compounds. Various in silico methods can make this process simple and economic. We, therefore, performed pharmacophore mapping, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) prediction to screen potential candidates against dengue. In particular, combined pharmacophore mapping and molecular docking were used to prioritize the potentially active ligands from a ligand library. Biological activities of plant based ligands were predicted using 3D-QSAR pharmacophore modeling. Interaction between proteins, namely, envelope G protein, NS2B/NS3 protease, NS5 methyltransferase, NS1, NS5 polymerase and active plant-based ligands (pIC50 > 5.1) were analyzed using molecular docking. Best docked complex, namely, envelope G protein–mulberroside C, NS2B-NS3 protease–curcumin, NS5 methyltransferase–chebulic acid, NS1–mulberroside A, NS5 methyltransferase–punigluconin and NS5 methyltransferase–chebulic acid were further subjected to MD simulations study to assess the fluctuation and conformational changes during protein–ligand interaction.

To tackle DENV infection, the development of therapeutic molecules as direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has been demonstrated as a truly effective approach. Among various DENV drug targets, non-structural protein 5 (NS5)—a highly conserved protein among the family Flaviviridae—carries the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DENVRdRp) domain at the C-terminal, and its “N-pocket” allosteric site is widely considered for anti-DENV drug development. Therefore, in this study, we developed a pharmacophore model by utilising 41 known inhibitors of the DENVRdRp domain, and performed model screening against the FDA’s approved drug database for drug repurposing against DENVRdRp. Herein, drugs complying with the pharmacophore hypothesis were further processed through standard-precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP) docking scores (DSs) and binding pose refinement based on MM/GBSA binding energy (BE) calculations.

Furthermore, 100 ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations and end-point binding free energy assessments support the considerable stability and free energy of the selected drugs in the targeted allosteric pocket of DENVRdRp.

It is caused by four closely-related dengue viruses (DENVs 1–4). A dengue vaccine that can protect against all four viruses is an unmet public health need. Live attenuated vaccine development efforts have encountered unexpected interactions between the vaccine viruses, raising safety concerns. This has emphasized the need to explore non-replicating dengue vaccine options. Virus-like particles (VLPs) which can elicit robust immunity in the absence of infection offer potential promise for the development of non-replicating dengue vaccine alternatives. We have used the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris to develop DENV envelope (E) protein-based VLPs. We designed a synthetic codon-optimized gene, encoding the N-terminal 395 amino acid residues of the DENV-2 E protein. It also included 5’ pre-membrane-derived signal peptide-encoding sequences to ensure proper translational processing, and 3’ 6× His tag-encoding sequences to facilitate purification of the expressed protein. This gene was integrated into the genome of P. pastoris host and expressed under the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter by methanol induction. Recombinant DENV-2 protein, which was present in the insoluble membrane fraction, was extracted and purified using Ni2+-affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. Amino terminal sequencing and detection of glycosylation indicated that DENV-2 E had undergone proper post-translational processing. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of discrete VLPs in the purified protein preparation after dialysis. The E protein present in these VLPs was recognized by two different conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Low doses of DENV-2 E VLPs formulated in alum were immunogenic in inbred and outbred mice eliciting virus neutralizing titers >1∶1200 in flow cytometry based assays and protected AG129 mice against lethal challenge (p<0.05).

It causes ~400 million infections annually and is considered to be one of the fastest spreading vector-borne diseases. Four distinct serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) cause dengue disease, which may be either mild or extremely severe. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), by pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies, is considered to be the major mechanism underlying severe disease. This mandates that a preventive vaccine must confer simultaneous and durable immunity to each of the four prevalent DENV serotypes. Recently, we used Pichia pastoris, to express recombinant DENV-2 E ectodomain, and found that it assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs), in the absence of prM, implicated in the elicitation of ADE-mediating antibodies. These VLPs elicited predominantly type-specific neutralizing antibodies that conferred significant protection against lethal DENV-2 challenge, in a mouse model. The current work is an extension of this approach to develop prM-lacking DENV-3 E VLPs. Our data reveal that P. pastoris-produced DENV-3 E VLPs not only preserve the antigenic integrity of the major neutralizing epitopes, but also elicit potent DENV-3 virus-neutralizing antibodies. Further, these neutralizing antibodies appear to be exclusively directed toward domain III of the DENV-3 E VLPs. Significantly, they also lack discernible ADE potential toward heterotypic DENVs.

Currently there are only preventive strategies and development of vaccination is still in its infancy of research. It is therefore highly necessary to discover newer drugs and therapies for this deadly virus. In this paper we report important insights we have obtained through a computational analysis of small molecules of Neem (Azadirachta indica) against dengue viral proteins and its required proteins in human.

Significance Statement We report important ligands in Neem that have potential antiviral activity against Dengue. Our selection of Neem for testing for antiviral properties has been inspired from Ayurveda.

The flavivirus RNA genome is replicated by the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of non-structural protein 5 (NS5). This essential enzymatic activity renders the RdRp attractive for antiviral therapy. NS5 synthesizes viral RNA via a “de novo” initiation mechanism. Crystal structures of the flavivirus RdRp revealed a “closed” conformation reminiscent of a pre-initiation state, with a well ordered priming loop that extrudes from the thumb subdomain into the dsRNA exit tunnel, close to the “GDD” active site. To-date, no allosteric pockets have been identified for the RdRp, and compound screening campaigns did not yield suitable drug candidates. Using fragment-based screening via X-ray crystallography, we found a fragment that bound to a pocket of the apo-DENV RdRp close to its active site (termed “N pocket”). Structure-guided improvements yielded DENV pan-serotype inhibitors of the RdRp de novo initiation activity with nano-molar potency that also impeded elongation activity at micro-molar concentrations. Inhibitors exhibited mixed inhibition kinetics with respect to competition with the RNA or GTP substrate. The best compounds have EC50 values of 1–2 μM against all four DENV serotypes in cell culture assays. Genome-sequencing of compound-resistant DENV replicons, identified amino acid changes that mapped to the N pocket. Since inhibitors bind at the thumb/palm interface of the RdRp, this class of compounds is proposed to hinder RdRp conformational changes during its transition from initiation to elongation. This is the first report of a class of pan-serotype and cell-active DENV RdRp inhibitors. Given the evolutionary conservation of residues lining the N pocket, these molecules offer insights to treat other serious conditions caused by flaviviruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6634,"details":{"paperId":"2c71de8e6020b5d0bbab8f390a3f36d28a40f816","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3990716","MAG":"2066235960","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1004072","CorpusId":"14433059","PubMed":"24743696"},"title":"Potent Dengue Virus Neutralization by a Therapeutic Antibody with Low Monovalent Affinity Requires Bivalent Engagement","abstract":"We recently described our most potently neutralizing monoclonal antibody, E106, which protected against lethal Dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) infection in mice.

In the present study, a DENV-1-specific human monoclonal antibody (HMAb), 1G5, isolated from single plasma cells obtained from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of dengue patients was found to have potent neutralization activity against serotype 1 DENV (DENV-1). Its neutralization activity against DENV-2 was not as strong, and it was almost absent for DENV-3 and DENV-4. The results showed that HMAb 1G5 only binds to the envelop protein of intact DENV-1 or the envelop protein under unheated and non-reducing conditions, and that it does not bind to recombinant envelope protein.

Further, the findings showed that HMAb 1G5 potently neutralizes DENV-1 in both the pre- and post-attachment phases of the virus at low concentrations. In vivo studies showed that HMAb 1G5 provides protection from DENV-1 infection in a murine model.

Together, these findings suggest that mature particles may be the optimal form of presentation of the envelope protein to induce more potent neutralizing antibodies against DENV. ABSTRACT The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. The envelope (E) protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and contains 3 domains (domain I [DI], DII, and DIII). Recent studies reported that human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing DIII, the D1/DII hinge, the E-dimer epitope, or a quaternary epitope involving DI/DII/DIII are more potently neutralizing than those recognizing the fusion loop (FL) of DII. Due to inefficient cleavage of the premembrane protein, DENV suspensions consist of a mixture of mature, immature, and partially immature particles. We investigated the neutralization and binding of 22 human MAbs to DENV serotype 1 (DENV1) virions with differential maturation status. Compared with FL MAbs, DIII, DI/DII hinge, and E-dimer epitope MAbs showed higher maximum binding and avidity to mature particles relative to immature particles; this feature may contribute to the strong neutralizing potency of such MAbs. FL-specific MAbs required 57 to 87% occupancy on mature particles to achieve half-maximal neutralization (NT50), whereas the potently neutralizing MAbs achieved NT50 states at 20 to 38% occupancy. Analysis of the MAb repertoire and polyclonal sera from patients with primary DENV1 infection supports the immunodominance of cross-reactive anti-E antibodies over type-specific antibodies. After depletion with viral particles from a heterologous DENV serotype, the type-specific neutralizing antibodies remained and showed binding features shared by potent neutralizing MAbs. Taken together, these findings suggest that the use of homogeneous mature DENV particles as an immunogen may induce more potent neutralizing antibodies against DENV than the use of immature or mixed particles. IMPORTANCE With an estimated 390 million infections per year, the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in humans.

Alkaloids are important phytochemicals of medicinal plant and can be used as vaccine candidates for viruses. Therefore, present study was designed to find potential alkaloids inhibitors against the Dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease which can inhibit the viral replication inside the host cell. Through molecular docking it was investigated that most of the alkaloids bound deeply in the binding pocket of Dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease and had potential interactions with catalytic triad. Five alkaloids (6’-desmethylthalifaboramin; 3,5-dihydroxythalifaboramine; Betanin; Reserpic acid and  Tubulosine) successfully blocked the catalytic triad of NS2B/NS3 protease and these alkaloids can serve as a potential drug candidate to stop viral replication. It can be concluded from this study that these alkaloids could serve as important inhibitors to inhibit the replication of DENV and need further in-vitro investigations to confirm their efficacy and drug ability.

The virus is endemic in over 120 countries, causing over 350 million infections per year. Dengue vaccine development is challenging because of the need to induce simultaneous protection against four antigenically distinct DENV serotypes and evidence that, under some conditions, vaccination can enhance disease due to specific immunity to the virus. While several live-attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccines display partial efficacy, it has been challenging to induce balanced protective immunity to all 4 serotypes. Instead of using whole-virus formulations, we are exploring the potentials for a particulate subunit vaccine, based on DENV E-protein displayed on nanoparticles that have been precisely molded using Particle Replication in Non-wetting Template (PRINT) technology. Here we describe immunization studies with a DENV2-nanoparticle vaccine candidate. The ectodomain of DENV2-E protein was expressed as a secreted recombinant protein (sRecE), purified and adsorbed to poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles of different sizes and shape. We show that PRINT nanoparticle adsorbed sRecE without any adjuvant induces higher IgG titers and a more potent DENV2-specific neutralizing antibody response compared to the soluble sRecE protein alone. Antigen trafficking indicate that PRINT nanoparticle display of sRecE prolongs the bio-availability of the antigen in the draining lymph nodes by creating an antigen depot.

Aedes mosquito is responsible for transmitting various serotypes of dengue viruses to humans. Dengue incidence has developed prominently throughout the world in the last ten years. The exact number of dengue cases is underestimated, whereas plenty of cases are misdiagnosed as alternative febrile sicknesses. There is an estimation that about 390 million dengue cases occur annually. Dengue fever encompasses a wide range of clinical presentations, usually with undefinable clinical progression and outcome. The diagnosis of dengue depends on serology tests, molecular diagnostic methods, and antigen detection tests. The therapeutic approach relies completely on supplemental drugs, which is far from the real approach. Vaccines for dengue disease are in various stages of development. The commercial formulation Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) is accessible and developed by Sanofi Pasteur. The vaccine candidate Dengvaxia was inefficient in liberating a stabilized immune reaction toward different serotypes (1–4) of dengue fever. Numerous promising vaccine candidates are now being developed in preclinical and clinical stages even though different serotypes of DENV exist that worsen the situation for a vaccine to be equally effective for all serotypes.

The proteins were produced in soluble form in the supernatant of the culture and were purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The fraction of 80% of ammonium sulfate was used as an antigen in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), providing a sensitivity of 82.61% and a specificity of 89.25%. Thus, the methodology proposed here showed promise for obtaining antigens of dengue viruses and creating quick and inexpensive diagnostic tests, which is of great value since large portions of the areas affected by this disease are economically neglected.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The methodology proposed here showed promise for obtaining antigens of dengue viruses and creating quick and inexpensive diagnostic tests, which is of great value since large portions of the areas affected by this disease are economically neglected."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4761,"details":{"paperId":"59c4f4b8d5042a18ad303a4fd8e1a1549490c278","externalIds":{"MAG":"2322022606","DOI":"10.1128/CVI.00081-16","CorpusId":"4789503","PubMed":"27030586"},"title":"Production of a Recombinant Dengue Virus 2 NS5 Protein and Potential Use as a Vaccine Antigen","abstract":"ABSTRACT Dengue fever is caused by any of the four known dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4) that affect millions of people worldwide, causing a significant number of deaths.

Anti-DENV vaccine strategies based on nonstructural proteins are promising alternatives to those based on whole virus or structural proteins. The DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is the main target of anti-DENV T cell-based immune responses in humans. In this study, we purified a soluble recombinant form of DENV2 NS5 expressed in Escherichia coli at large amounts and high purity after optimization of expression conditions and purification steps. The purified DENV2 NS5 was recognized by serum from DENV1-, DENV2-, DENV3-, or DENV4-infected patients in an epitope-conformation-dependent manner. In addition, immunization of BALB/c mice with NS5 induced high levels of NS5-specific antibodies and expansion of gamma interferon- and tumor necrosis factor alpha-producing T cells. Moreover, mice immunized with purified NS5 were partially protected from lethal challenges with the DENV2 NGC strain and with a clinical isolate (JHA1).

There are four serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV 1‐4) and a safe and effective dengue vaccine must provide protection against all four serotypes. To date, the first vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD‐TDV), is available after many decades’ efforts, but only has moderate efficacy. More effective and affordable vaccines are hence required. Plants offer promising vaccine production platforms and food crops offer additional advantages for the production of edible human and animal vaccines, thus eliminating the need for expensive fermentation, purification, cold storage and sterile delivery. Oral vaccines can elicit humoural and cellular immunity via both the mucosal and humoral immune systems. Here, we report the production of tetravalent EDIII antigen (EDIII‐1‐4) in stably transformed lettuce chloroplasts. Transplastomic EDIII‐1‐4‐expressing lettuce lines were obtained and homoplasmy was verified by Southern blot analysis. Expression of EDIII‐1‐4 antigens was demonstrated by immunoblotting, with the EDIII‐1‐4 antigen accumulating to 3.45% of the total protein content. Immunological assays in rabbits showed immunogenicity of EDIII‐1‐4.

Since vector control programs have been difficult to sustain, public health authorities have called for development of a dengue virus (DENV) vaccine. Vaccination is a proven method of infectious disease control. The successful development of a liveattenuated vaccine for yellow fever in the mid-20th century encouraged many that a live-attenuated vaccine for dengue fever, which is caused by a complex of four viruses in the same family (Flaviviridae) as yellow fever virus, could be developed. For several decades, the public health vision has been that control of endemic dengue fever could be achieved by routine administration of a live-attenuated DENV vaccine to children residing in affected countries. Because dengue fever is an important disease in some travelers, and infected travelers appear to be major means by which DENV spreads between countries, additional disease control could be achieved by vaccination of non-immune travelers to and within the tropics. Historically, dengue fever has adversely affected military forces deployed from temperate to tropical or sub-tropical locales. Much early research on dengue was conducted or funded by the United States Army, which saw operational effectiveness degraded by epidemic dengue during troop deployments in almost every decade of the 20th century. Following the successful propagation of dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) and DENV-2 in mouse brains, the United States Army sponsored more than a decade of research to develop live-attenuated DENV vaccines manufactured in mouse brains. This work culminated in a field efficacy trial in Puerto Rico in 1962 in which partial protection of subjects administered DENV-1 vaccine was observed during an outbreak of predominantly DENV-3. Ultimately, the United States Army halted development of the DENV mouse brain vaccine when propagation of DENV in cell cultures, a theoretically safer production substrate, was achieved. Bolstered by the preliminary evidence of vaccine efficacy in Puerto Rico, and the observation that low-passage DENV-2 isolates that produced small plaques in cell monolayers were also temperature sensitive and less pathogenic for suckling mice, the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command in 1971 launched a program at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) to develop a cloned, temperature-sensitive, live-attenuated vaccine candidate for each DENV type. Between 1975 and 1985, four vaccine candidates were produced, tested in non-human primates, and then administered to small numbers of volunteers. Although the DENV-2 candidate, the first to enter clinical trials was attenuated, it was less immunogenic than desired. A DENV-4 candidate was over-attenuated and virus isolated from vaccine recipients had lost the small plaque phenotype. A DENV-1 candidate was under-attenuated and caused illness; the same was true of a DENV-3 candidate. These results demonstrated that temperature sensitivity and plaque morphology were insufficiently predictive of DENV attenuation for humans. A new approach to developing DENV vaccine candidates was required. The discovery by Halstead at the University of Hawaii that DENV could be propagated serially in primary dog kidney (PDK) cells, an unnatural cell substrate, offered a promising solution. Two groups formed to exploit this discovery: one at Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand and the other at the WRAIR in the United States. Both received one or more seed viruses that had been adapted to growth in PDK cells from the University of Hawaii. Over the past 18 years, both groups have developed tetravalent DENV vaccines, conducted successful phase I studies, and attracted a major vaccine manufacturer as a co-development partner. The preclinical and early clinical development of the WRAIR liveattenuated tetravalent DENV vaccine candidate is the subject of the following seven papers in this supplement. In this report, we briefly summarize the overall DENV vaccine development effort at WRAIR and collaborating laboratories between 1986 and 2000.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The preclinical and early clinical development of the WRAIR liveattenuated tetravalent DENV vaccine candidate is the subject of the following seven papers in this supplement."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":324,"details":{"paperId":"b0bea48e3d7d26bb7abea2f976b8e10f5b18cedb","externalIds":{"MAG":"2222097738","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4899-1450-7_12","CorpusId":"74532544"},"title":"Progress in the Development of Recombinant Vaccines Against Dengue and Other Arthropod-Borne Flaviviruses","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Dengue is an acute viral disease characterized by fever, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, and headache that generally last about a week, and while complete recovery is the rule convalescence may be prolonged."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5455,"details":{"paperId":"02a2830c5a97d03ea529df2bc4341824bf0bdaa0","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"4135166","MAG":"2056449132","DOI":"10.1155/2014/825039","CorpusId":"5892107","PubMed":"25157370"},"title":"Progress in the Identification of Dengue Virus Entry/Fusion Inhibitors","abstract":"Dengue fever, a reemerging disease, is putting nearly 2.5 billion people at risk worldwide.

The disease has several clinical manifestations, from the mild cold-like illness to the more serious hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome.

Several groups of researchers have targeted the initial step in the infection as a potential approach to interfere with the virus.

This model includes detailed spatial representation of the Yucatán population, including the location and movement of 1.8 million people between 375,000 households and 100,000 workplaces and schools. Where possible, we designed the model to use data sources with international coverage, to simplify re-parameterization for other regions.

To fit model parameters that are not directly informed by available data, such as disease reporting rates and dengue transmission parameters, we developed a parameter estimation toolkit called AbcSmc, which we have made publicly available. After fitting the simulation model to dengue case data, we forecasted transmission and assessed the relative effectiveness of several vaccination strategies over a 20 year period.

Many studies have identified the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) to be important for successful DENV production, but how the UPP contributes to DENV life cycle as host factors remains ill defined.

Although severe disease has been associated with heterotypic secondary DENV infection, most secondary DENV infections are asymptomatic or result in classic DF. The role of cross-reactive immunity in mediating cross-protection against secondary heterotypic DENV infection is not well understood. DENV infection of IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptor-deficient (AG129) mice reproduces key features of human disease. We previously demonstrated a role in cross-protection for pre-existing cross-reactive Abs, maintained by long-lived plasma cells. In this study, we use a sequential infection model, infecting AG129 mice with DENV-1, followed by DENV-2 6–8 wk later. We find that increased DENV-specific avidity during acute secondary heterotypic infection is mediated by cross-reactive memory B cells, as evidenced by increased numbers of DENV-1–specific cells by ELISPOT and higher avidity against DENV-1 of supernatants from polyclonally stimulated splenocytes isolated from mice experiencing secondary DENV-2 infection. However, increased DENV-specific avidity is not associated with increased DENV-specific neutralization, which appears to be mediated by naive B cells. Adoptive transfer of DENV-1–immune B and T cells into naive mice prior to secondary DENV-2 infection delayed mortality. Mice depleted of T cells developed signs of disease, but recovered after secondary DENV infection. Overall, we found that protective cross-reactive Abs are secreted by both long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells and that both cross-reactive B cells and T cells provide protection against a secondary heterotypic DENV infection.

Although a vaccine for dengue virus is now available in a few countries, its reported overall efficacy of about 60% is not ideal. Protective immune correlates following natural dengue virus infection remain undefined, which makes it difficult to predict the efficacy of new vaccines. In this study, we address the protective capacity of dengue virus-specific antibodies that are produced by plasmablasts a few days after natural secondary infection. Among a panel of 18 dengue virus-reactive human monoclonal antibodies, four groups of antibodies were identified based on their binding properties. While antibodies targeting the fusion loop of the glycoprotein of dengue virus dominated the antibody response, two smaller groups of antibodies bound to previously undescribed epitopes in domain II of the E protein. The latter, largely serotype-cross-reactive antibodies, demonstrated increased stability of binding at pH 5. These antibodies possessed weak to moderate neutralization capacity in vitro but were the most efficacious in promoting the survival of infected mice. Our data suggest that the cross-reactive anamnestic antibody response has a protective capacity despite moderate neutralization in vitro and a moderate decrease of viremia in vivo. IMPORTANCE Antibodies can protect from symptomatic dengue virus infection. However, it is not easy to assess which classes of antibodies provide protection because in vitro assays are not always predictive of in vivo protection. During a repeat infection, dengue virus-specific immune memory cells are reactivated and large amounts of antibodies are produced. By studying antibodies cloned from patients with heterologous secondary infection, we tested the protective value of the serotype-cross-reactive “recall” or “anamnestic” response. We found that results from in vitro neutralization assays did not always correlate with the ability of the antibodies to reduce viremia in a mouse model. In addition, a decrease of viremia in mice did not necessarily improve survival.

Within the context of the current understanding of immunity in dengue or immunity to other vaccines, the observed failures of protection cannot be adequately explained. These results comprise the background to this review of contemporary research on protective immunity in dengue, summarized by Slifka (4). Studies on wild-type dengue virus (DENV) infections of humans since World War II have revealed a consistent pattern of cross-protection after a single DENV infection against infection with a different DENV. Inapparent infections or mild disease accompany sequential DENV infections spaced at relatively short intervals (<1.4–1.9 years), while overt and severe disease accompany sequential infections at longer intervals. Grange et al. provide an analytical review of inapparent DENV infections published so far in the literature (5). It has been asked whether these inapparent infections serve as a major reservoir for the sustained infection of Aedes aegypti. Parameters of infection of A. aegypti by feeding on humans with dengue illnesses described here by Carrington et al. are a model for research directed at answering this question (6). An overview report by Endy (7) on the spectrum of human responses to wild-type DENV infection, from inapparent to hospitalized severe dengue, provides evidence that heterotypic DENV plaque-reduction neutralizing antibodies do not predict protection against a second DENV. This was the central feature of the Sanofi tetravalent dengue vaccine trial in Thai children (1). DENV 2 neutralizing antibodies uniformly were raised by three doses of vaccine yet failed to protect against symptomatic DENV 2 infections (1). \n \nA longitudinal study on human immune responses to wild-type DENV infection describes how heterotypic immunity modulates disease, including evidence that cellular immunity contributes to protection (8). Weiskopf and Sette show that CD8+ T cells contribute to protection against disease with second DENV infections by targeting epitopes on non-structural antigens (8). In the Sanofi tetravalent chimeric vaccine, this T cell contribution may be missing as DENV non-structural proteins are not present in the vaccine, replaced by those of yellow fever (1–3). Studies on humans and animal models, summarized by Petitdemange et al. (9), find that antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and natural killer (NK) cells contribute to controlling early-stage viral infections. Since most human DENV infections are silent, NK cell-mediated protection may dominate (9, 10). This possibility is illustrated by observations from Cuba and Vietnam, reviewed by Beltran and Lopez-Verges (10), where differential distribution of alleles of the MHC-Class I chain-related genes A or B (MICA or MICB) suggest that NK responses have been suppressed in those individuals who developed severe disease. Cells of the immune system, including dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes (Mo), and macrophages (Mφ) serve as hosts of DENV infection. Immature DCs express DC-SIGN, a universal receptor for DENV. Immature DCs evolve from blood Mo that have migrated into the skin. In a mouse model, Schmid et al. show that immature DCs are initial sites of infection and once infected become mature and migrate to regional lymph nodes (11). Mature DCs lose DC-SIGN but gain Fc receptors (FcRs) and can be infected efficiently by infectious immune complexes. Different FcRs on Mo and Mφ interact with specific isotypes of IgG. When infectious DENV immune complexes attach to Mo and Mφ FcγRIIA a signal is sent suppressing interferon (IFN) type I production leading to the enhanced virus production (11). \n \nA broad range of subhuman primate species are readily infected with wild-type or attenuated DENV. But, monkeys do not respond to infection with a disease mimicking the dengue vascular permeability syndrome (DVPS). Nonetheless, immune responses and protection to challenge in monkeys are closely similar to those observed in humans. Sariol and White review the utility and limitations of this animal model (12). Monkeys inoculated with tetravalent Sanofi and Takeda live-attenuated chimeric vaccines revealed the same dominance of DENV 4 and DENV 2-driven immune responses and protection observed in humans, respectively. T cell immune responses are scarcely studied in monkeys. In contrast, in mouse models, as shown by Zellweger and Shresta (13), adoptive transfer of T cells demonstrate the important contribution of the T cell component to protection following a first or second DENV infection. Mice lacking receptors to type I IFN, however, do have a pathophysiological response closely similar to DVPS. In these mice, suboptimal doses of DENV2 result in mild illness. In the presence of enhancing concentrations of dengue antibodies, i.e., sub-neutralizing concentrations that induce antibody-dependent enhancement or ADE, the same dose of DENV induces lethal disease (13). \n \nThe review is completed by a description by Ambuel et al. (14) of the successful immunization of cynomolgous monkeys using two doses of a DENV2 chimeric tetravalent vaccine given at day 0 (rapid immunization strategy or RIS), as compared to the traditional prime and boost given 2 months later. As evidence of solid protection, when challenged with DENV 2, animals were protected against viremia with no boost in DENV 2 neutralizing antibodies, showing that the RIS induced a sterilizing immunity (14). Another important feature of this trial was the demonstration of T cell immunity to DENV 2 non-structural proteins with collateral cross-reactive T cell immunity to other DENV types (14). This original article shows that RIS could be very useful in endemic areas to increase compliance to vaccination schedules and reinforce the necessity to study, in more detail, protective dengue-induced T cell immunity.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review of contemporary research on protective immunity in dengue finds that antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and natural killer (NK) cells contribute to controlling early-stage viral infections."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7562,"details":{"paperId":"0271c41997ab05f996543ed28b479292d47ef2aa","externalIds":{"MAG":"3095601005","PubMedCentral":"8757693","DOI":"10.3389/fmedt.2020.558984","CorpusId":"226078444","PubMed":"35047876"},"title":"Protective Immunity to Dengue Virus Induced by DNA Vaccines Encoding Nonstructural Proteins in a Lethal Challenge Immunocompetent Mouse Model","abstract":"Dengue virus represents the main arbovirus affecting humans, but there are no effective drugs or available worldwide licensed vaccine formulations capable of conferring full protection against the infection.

In plants, RNA silencing has been associated with protection from virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate that dsRNA-mediated interference also can act as a viral defense mechanism in mosquito cells. C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells were stably transformed with a plasmid designed to transcribe an inverted-repeat RNA (irRNA) derived from the genome of dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) capable of forming dsRNA. Clonal cell lines were selected with an antibiotic resistance marker and challenged with DEN-2. The cell lines were classified as either susceptible or resistant to virus replication, based on the percentage of cells expressing DEN-2 envelope (E) antigen 7 days after challenge. Eight out of 18 (44%) cell lines designed to express irRNA were resistant to DEN-2 challenge, with more than 95% of the cells showing no DEN-2 antigen accumulation. One of the DEN-2-resistant cell lines, FB 9.1, was further characterized. DEN-2 genome RNA failed to accumulate in FB 9.1 cells after challenge.

Higher viremia levels are associated with greater dengue disease severity. A therapeutic intervention to suppress viremia early in DV infection could potentially ameliorate severe disease. Recombinant alpha interferon 2a (rIFN-α-2a, Roferon-A) suppressed DV replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. We therefore examined the effects of rIFN-α-2a and pegylated recombinant IFN-α-2a (PEG-rIFN-α-2a, PEGASYS) on DV serotype 2 (DV-2) viremia in rhesus monkeys. Flavivirus-naïve monkeys were inoculated with DV-2 and randomized to receive a single dose of rIFN-α-2a (10 million international units/m2) versus placebo or PEG-rIFN-α-2a (6 μg/kg) versus placebo 1 day after the onset of viremia. Serial daily viremia levels were measured, and convalescent-phase DV-2 neutralizing antibody titers were determined. Compared to placebo, a single injection of rIFN-α-2a temporarily suppressed DV-2 replication and delayed the time to peak viremia by a median of 3 days. However, measures of total viral burden were not different between the two groups. A single injection of PEG-rIFN-α-2a significantly lowered daily viremia levels and improved virus clearance, starting 48 h after administration.

These viruses have evolved viral methyltransferase(s) to methylate N-7 and 2′-O cap of their RNA; alternatively, they “snatch” host mRNA cap to form the 5′ end of viral RNA. The function of 2′-O methylation of viral RNA cap is to mimic cellular mRNA and to evade host innate immune restriction. A cytoplasmic virus defective in 2′-O methylation is replicative, but its viral RNA lacks 2′-O methylation and is recognized and eliminated by the host immune response. Such a mutant virus could be rationally designed as a live attenuated vaccine. Here, we use Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an important mosquito-borne flavivirus, to prove this novel vaccine concept. We show that JEV methyltransferase is responsible for both N-7 and 2′-O cap methylations as well as evasion of host innate immune response. Recombinant virus completely defective in 2′-O methylation was stable in cell culture after being passaged for >30 days. The mutant virus was attenuated in mice, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and retained the engineered mutation in vivo. A single dose of immunization induced full protection against lethal challenge with JEV strains in mice. Mechanistically, the attenuation phenotype was attributed to the enhanced sensitivity of the mutant virus to the antiviral effects of interferon and IFIT proteins. Collectively, the results demonstrate the feasibility of using 2′-O methylation-defective virus as a vaccine approach; this vaccine approach should be applicable to other flaviviruses and nonflaviviruses that encode their own viral 2′-O methyltransferases.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results demonstrate the feasibility of using 2′-O methylation-defective virus as a vaccine approach and this vaccine approach should be applicable to other flaviviruses and nonflavivirus that encode their own viral 2′/O methyltransferases."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6624,"details":{"paperId":"0080d3bd9fb92e022c27715c2d1249042aa998b8","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3731252","MAG":"2093633436","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003521","CorpusId":"8111607","PubMed":"23935499"},"title":"Rational Design of a Live Attenuated Dengue Vaccine: 2′-O-Methyltransferase Mutants Are Highly Attenuated and Immunogenic in Mice and Macaques","abstract":"Dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and infects at least 100 million people every year.

Various recombinant proteins of therapeutic and prophylactic importance have been successfully produced in microbial and higher expression host systems.

Therefore, efficacious vaccines are needed to control the spread of dengue worldwide. Dengue is an emerging viral disease caused by any of dengue virus 1–4 serotypes that affects the human population around the globe. Dengue virus is a single stranded RNA virus encoding three structural proteins (capsid protein, pre-membrane protein, and envelope protein) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5). As the only licensed dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) is unable to confer balanced protection against all the serotypes, therefore various approaches for development of dengue vaccines including tetravalent live attenuated, inactivated, plasmid DNA, virus-vectored, virus-like particles, and recombinant subunit vaccines are being explored. These candidates are at different stages of vaccine development and have their own merits and demerits. The promising subunit vaccines are mainly based on envelope or its domain and non-structural proteins of dengue virus. These proteins have been produced in different hosts and are being investigated for development of a successful dengue vaccine. Novel immunogens have been designed employing various strategies like protein engineering and fusion of antigen with various immunostimulatory motif to work as self-adjuvant. Moreover, recombinant proteins can be formulated with novel adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity and thus conferring better protection to the vaccinees. With the advent of newer and safer host systems, these recombinant proteins can be produced in a cost effective manner at large scale for vaccine studies.

There has been an urgent need to identify an effective and safe dengue inhibitor as a therapeutic and a prophylactic agent for dengue fever. Most clinically approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency syndrome-1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) target virally encoded enzymes such as protease or polymerase. Inhibitors of these enzymes were typically identified by target-based screening followed by optimization via structure-based design. However, due to the lack of success to date of research efforts to identify dengue protease and polymerase inhibitors, alternative strategies for anti-dengue drug discovery need to be considered. As a complementary approach to the target-based drug discovery, phenotypic screening is a strategy often used in identification of new chemical starting points with novel mechanisms of action in the area of infectious diseases such as antibiotics, antivirals, and anti-parasitic agents.

Using a human skin explant model, we show that DENV-3 immune sera increased recruitment and infection of Langerhans cells, macrophages and dermal dendritic cells following inoculation with DENV-2 or ZIKV. Similarly, ZIKV immune sera enhanced infection with DENV-2. Immune sera increased migration of infected Langerhans cells to dermis and emigration of infected cells out of skin. Heterotypic immune sera increased viral RNA in dermis almost tenfold and reduced the amount of virus required to infect a majority of myeloid cells by 100 to 1,000 fold. Enhancement was associated with cross-reactive IgG and induction of IL-10 expression and was mediated by both CD32 and CD64 Fcγ receptors.

The chimeric virus was recovered from the supernatant of Vero cells transfected with RNA transcripts and amplified once in these cells to yield a titer of 6.3 log10 PFU/ml.

This virus was evaluated in rhesus monkeys for its safety (induction of viremia) and protective efficacy (induction of anti-dengue-2 neutralizing antibodies and protection against challenge). In one experiment, groups of non-YF-immune monkeys received graded doses of ChimeriVax-D2; a control group received only the vaccine diluents. All monkeys (except the control group) developed a brief viremia and showed no signs of illness. Sixty-two days postimmunization, animals were challenged with 5.0 log10focus forming units (FFU) of a wild-type dengue-2 virus. No viremia (<1.7 log10 FFU/ml) was detected in any vaccinated group, whereas all animals in the placebo control group developed viremia. All vaccinated monkeys developed neutralizing antibodies in a dose-dependent response. In another experiment, viremia and production of neutralizing antibodies were determined in YF-immune monkeys that received either ChimeriVax-D2 or a wild-type dengue-2 virus. Low viremia was detected in ChimeriVax-D2-inoculated monkeys, whereas all dengue-2-immunized animals became viremic.

Reportedly, there has been a 2-fold increase in dengue cases every decade. An efficacious tetravalent vaccine, which can provide long-term immunity against all four serotypes in all target populations, is still unavailable. Despite the progress being made in the live virus-based dengue vaccines, the World Health Organization strongly recommends the development of alternative approaches for safe, affordable, and efficacious dengue vaccine candidates. We have explored virus-like particles (VLPs)-based nonreplicating subunit vaccine approach and have developed recombinant envelope ectodomains of DENV-1, 2, and 3 expressed in Pichia pastoris These self-assembled into VLPs without pre-membrane (prM) protein, which limits the generation of enhancing antibodies, and elicited type-specific neutralizing antibodies against the respective serotype. Encouraged by these results, we have extended this work further by developing P. pastoris-expressed DENV-4 ectodomain (DENV-4 E) in this study, which was found to be glycosylated and assembled into spherical VLPs without prM, and displayed critical neutralizing epitopes on its surface.

In this sense, vaccine strategies incorporating whole virus are able to elicit both functional and pathological responses. Therefore, an ideal tetravalent vaccine candidate against dengue should be focused on serotype-specific sequences. In the present work, a new formulation of nucleocapsid-like particles (NLPs) obtained from the recombinant dengue-2 capsid protein was evaluated in mice to determine the level of protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenge and to measure the cytotoxicity and cytokine-secretion profiles induced upon heterologous viral stimulation. As a result, a significant protection rate was achieved after challenge with lethal dengue-2 virus, which was dependent on CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. In turn, no protection was observed after heterologous challenge. In accordance, in vitro-stimulated spleen cells from mice immunized with NLPs from the four dengue serotypes showed a serotype-specific response of gamma interferon- and tumour necrosis factor alpha-secreting cells. A similar pattern was detected when spleen cells from dengue-immunized animals were stimulated with the capsid protein. Taking these data together, we can assert that NLPs constitute an attractive vaccine candidate against dengue. They induce a functional immune response mediated by CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells in mice, which is protective against viral challenge. In turn, they are potentially safe due to two important facts: induction of serotype specific cell-mediated immunity and lack of induction of antiviral antibodies. Further studies in non-human primates or humanized mice should be carried out to elucidate the usefulness of the NLPs as a potential vaccine candidate against dengue disease.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is asserted that NLPs constitute an attractive vaccine candidate against dengue because they induce a functional immune response mediated by CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells in mice, which is protective against viral challenge."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3904,"details":{"paperId":"330a21e526ec578c4cee3fc14732cd5e7805c6aa","externalIds":{"MAG":"2104966837","DOI":"10.1093/intimm/dxp082","CorpusId":"2897242","PubMed":"19692540"},"title":"Recombinant nucleocapsid-like particles from dengue-2 virus induce protective CD4+ and CD8+ cells against viral encephalitis in mice.","abstract":"Virus-like particles are a highly effective type of subunit vaccine that mimics the overall structure of virus particles without containing infectious genetic material.

We demonstrate in this paper the engineering of an antibody that binds to all four serotypes of dengue virus with potent activity in vitro and in vivo. We also outline a distinct and widely applicable approach to antibody engineering that provides important information on the paratope/epitope interface in the absence of crystal structure data, enabling identification of antibody amino acids that could be mutated. We demonstrate experimentally the alteration of both specificity (enabling cross-serotype binding) and affinity of the engineered antibody. Affinity improvement of proteins, including antibodies, by computational chemistry broadly relies on physics-based energy functions coupled with refinement. However, achieving significant enhancement of binding affinity (>10-fold) remains a challenging exercise, particularly for cross-reactive antibodies. We describe here an empirical approach that captures key physicochemical features common to antigen–antibody interfaces to predict protein–protein interaction and mutations that confer increased affinity. We apply this approach to the design of affinity-enhancing mutations in 4E11, a potent cross-reactive neutralizing antibody to dengue virus (DV), without a crystal structure. Combination of predicted mutations led to a 450-fold improvement in affinity to serotype 4 of DV while preserving, or modestly increasing, affinity to serotypes 1–3 of DV. We show that increased affinity resulted in strong in vitro neutralizing activity to all four serotypes, and that the redesigned antibody has potent antiviral activity in a mouse model of DV challenge.

The results have demonstrated the potential of the NS1 complementation system as an alternative platform for flavivirus vaccine development, especially for highly pathogenic flaviviruses. ABSTRACT We previously produced a replication-defective West Nile virus (WNV) lacking NS1 (WNV-ΔNS1) that could propagate at low levels (105 infectious units [IU]/ml) in a 293T cell line expressing wild-type (WT) NS1. This finding indicates the potential of developing WNV-ΔNS1 as a noninfectious vaccine. To explore this idea, we developed an NS1-expressing Vero cell line (VeroNS1) that significantly improved the yield of WNV-ΔNS1 (108 IU/ml). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of WNV-ΔNS1 in mice. WNV-ΔNS1 appeared to be safe, as no replicative virus was found in naive Vero cells after continuous culturing of WNV-ΔNS1 in VeroNS1 cells for 15 rounds. WNV-ΔNS1 was noninfectious in mice, even when IFNAR−/− mice were administered a high dose of WNV-ΔNS1. Vaccination with a single dose of WNV-ΔNS1 protected mice from a highly lethal challenge with WT WNV. The antibody response against WNV correlated well with the protection of vaccinated mice. Our study demonstrates the potential of the NS1 trans complementation system as a new platform for flavivirus vaccine development.

TMUV-CP showed dramatic functional and structural flexibility, and even though 44 residues were removed from the N-terminus, it was still capable of packaging replicon RNA; in addition, 33 residues were deleted from the C-terminus (containing nearly the entire α4-helix), and infectious particles were still produced, although α4-α4’ is supposedly vital for CP dimerization and nucleocapsid formation. We further analyzed two mutants (ΔC20-43 and ΔC64-96 viruses) with relatively large deletions that still replicated well in BHK-21 cells.

In Several prior studies, numerous possible chemical entities were proposed as potential Mpro inhibitors; however, most failed at various stages of drug discovery. Repositioning of existing antiviral compounds accelerates the discovery and development of potent therapeutic molecules. Hence, this study examines the applicability of anti-dengue compounds against the substrate binding site of Mpro for disrupting its polyprotein processing mechanism. An in-silico structure-based virtual screening approach is applied to screen 330 experimentally validated anti-dengue compounds to determine their affinity to the substrate binding site of Mpro.

The ideal dengue vaccine would provide protection against all serotypes after a single dose.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo randomized, placebo-controlled trials were performed with 168 flavivirus-naive adults to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TV003), compared with those of a second tetravalent vaccine with an enhanced DENV-2 component (TV005), and to evaluate the benefit of a booster dose at 6 months. Safety data, viremia, and neutralizing antibody titers were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA single dose of TV005 elicited a tetravalent response in 90% of vaccinees by 3 months after vaccination and a trivalent response in 98%. Compared with TV003, the higher-dose DENV-2 component increased the observed frequency of immunogenicity to DENV-2 in the TV005 trial. Both the first and second doses were well tolerated. Neither vaccine viremia, rash, nor a significant antibody boost were observed following a second dose.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA single subcutaneous dose of TV005 dengue vaccine is safe and induces a tetravalent antibody response at an unprecedented frequency among vaccinees.

Durable homotypic immunity follows infection but may predispose to severe subsequent heterotypic infections, a risk conferred in part by the immune response itself. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a process best described in vitro, is epidemiologically linked to complicated DV infections, especially in Southeast Asia. Here we report for the first time the ADE phenomenon in primary human dendritic cells (DC), early targets of DV infection, and human cell lines bearing Fc receptors. We show that ADE is inversely correlated with surface expression of DC-SIGN (DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin) and requires Fc gamma receptor IIa (FcγRIIa). Mature DC exhibited ADE, whereas immature DC, expressing higher levels of DC-SIGN and similar FcγRIIa levels, did not undergo ADE. ADE results in increased intracellular de novo DV protein synthesis, increased viral RNA production and release, and increased infectivity of the supernatants in mature DC. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), but not IL-10 and gamma interferon, were released in the presence of dengue patient sera but generally only at enhancement titers, suggesting a signaling component of ADE. FcγRIIa inhibition with monoclonal antibodies abrogated ADE and associated downstream consequences. DV versatility in entry routes (FcγRIIa or DC-SIGN) in mature DC broadens target options and suggests additional ways for DC to contribute to the pathogenesis of severe DV infection.

Dengue virus causes disease ranging from a self-limiting febrile illness (dengue fever) to the potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Severe dengue disease is associated with sub-protective levels of antibody, which exacerbate disease upon re-infection. A dengue vaccine should generate protective immunity without increasing severity of disease. To date, the determinants of vaccine-mediated protection against dengue remain unclear, and additional correlates of protection are urgently needed. Here, mice were immunized with viral replicon particles expressing the dengue envelope protein ectodomain to assess the relative contribution of humoral versus cellular immunity to protection. Vaccination with viral replicon particles provided robust protection against dengue challenge. Vaccine-induced humoral responses had the potential to either protect from or exacerbate dengue disease upon challenge, whereas cellular immune responses were beneficial.

This review is a compact digest of what is already known of the roles and the prospects of the dengue virus non-structural proteins NS1, NS2BNS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 as the targets for antiviral studies including the recent progress that has been published regarding their roles.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review is a compact digest of what is already known of the roles and the prospects of the dengue virus non-structural proteins NS1, NS2BNS3, NS4A,NS4B and NS5 as the targets for antiviral studies including the recent progress that has been published regarding their roles."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7720,"details":{"paperId":"f90c3eab43692abb4c28803844404efafd22edc8","externalIds":{"MAG":"3034852321","PubMedCentral":"7356240","DOI":"10.3390/microorganisms8060891","CorpusId":"219726104","PubMed":"32545679"},"title":"Roles of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor in Dengue Pathogenesis: From Pathogenic Factor to Therapeutic Target","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection and can lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and even life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Although the cytokine storm has been revealed as a critical factor in dengue disease, the limited understanding of dengue immunopathogenesis hinders the development of effective treatments. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that mediates diverse immune responses, and the serum level of MIF positively correlates with disease severity in patients with dengue. MIF is involved in DENV replication and many pathological changes, such as vascular leakage, during DENV infection.

Here we investigated inhibition of the flavivirus MTase by several AdoHcy-derivatives.

Binding studies confirmed that AdoHcy has a much lower binding affinity for the MTase than either the AdoMet co-factor, or the natural AdoMet analog inhibitor sinefungin (SIN). While AdoMet is a positively charged molecule, SIN is similar to AdoHcy in being uncharged, and only has an additional amine group that can make extra electrostatic contacts with the MTase. Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Sovation Area analysis on AdoHcy and SIN binding to the MTase suggests that the stronger binding of SIN may not be directly due to interactions of this amine group, but due to distributed differences in SIN binding resulting from its presence.

We analyzed pooled safety data from 18 phase I, II and III clinical trials in which the dengue vaccine was administered to participants aged 2–60 years, including long-term safety follow-up in three efficacy trials. The participants were analyzed according to their age at enrollment. The percentage of participants aged 2–60 years reporting ≥1 solicited injection-site or systemic reactions was slightly higher in the CYD-TDV group than in the placebo group. The most common solicited injection-site reactions were pain. Headache and malaise were the most common solicited systemic reactions. In both groups 0.3% of participants discontinued for safety reasons. The most common unsolicited adverse events were injection-site reactions, gastrointestinal disorders, and infections. Reactogenicity did not increase with successive doses of CYD-TDV. The frequency and nature of SAEs occurring within 28 days of any dose were similar in the CYD-TDV and placebo groups and were common medical conditions that could be expected as a function of age. Baseline dengue virus serostatus did not appear to influence the safety profile. No vaccine-related anaphylactic reactions, neurotropic events or viscerotropic events were reported. In year 3 after dose 1, an imbalance for dengue hospitalization, including for severe dengue, observed in participants aged <9 years in the CYD-TDV group compared with the placebo group was not observed for participants aged ≥9 years. In Year 4, this imbalance in participants aged <9 years was less marked, giving an overall lower risk of dengue hospitalization or severe dengue from dose 1 to Year 4 in the CYD-TDV group. These results have contributed to the definition of the target population for vaccination (≥9 years old) for which CYD-TDV has a satisfactory safety profile.

Whether flaviviruses require an activated nuclear factor(s) to complete their life cycle and trigger apoptosis in infected cells remains elusive. Flavivirus infections quickly activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and salicylates have been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation. In this study, we investigated whether salicylates suppress flavivirus replication and virus-induced apoptosis in cultured cells. In a dose-dependent inhibition, we found salicylates within a range of 1 to 5 mM not only restricted flavivirus replication but also abrogated flavivirus-triggered apoptosis. However, flavivirus replication was not affected by a specific NF-κB peptide inhibitor, SN50, and a proteosome inhibitor, lactacystin. Flaviviruses also replicated and triggered apoptosis in cells stably expressing IκBα-ΔN, a dominant-negative mutant that antagonizes NF-κB activation, as readily as in wild-type BHK-21 cells, suggesting that NF-κB activation is not essential for either flavivirus replication or flavivirus-induced apoptosis. Salicylates still diminished flavivirus replication and blocked apoptosis in the same IκBα-ΔN cells. This inhibition of flaviviruses by salicylates could be partially reversed by a specific p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor, SB203580. Together, these results show that the mechanism by which salicylates suppress flavivirus infection may involve p38 MAP kinase activity but is independent of blocking the NF-κB pathway.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results show that the mechanism by which salicylates suppress flavivirus infection may involve p38 MAP kinase activity but is independent of blocking the NF-κB pathway."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":607,"details":{"paperId":"62d4befd4e89777113d6dab875990e4f6e5fbfdd","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s00705-016-3034-1","CorpusId":"245013399","PubMed":"34888705"},"title":"Salidroside exhibits anti-dengue virus activity by upregulating host innate immune factors","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Salidroside exhibits antiviral activity againstDENV by inhibiting viral protein synthesis and boosting host immunity by increasing the expression of host innate immune factors and hence could be considered for the development of an effective therapeutic agent against DENV infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3284,"details":{"paperId":"4cf317cedcd8fa792fe029e52f9061795599229a","externalIds":{"MAG":"2945790210","DOI":"10.1039/C9MD00200F","CorpusId":"182539228","PubMed":"31303998"},"title":"Scaffold hybridization strategy towards potent hydroxamate-based inhibitors of Flaviviridae viruses and Trypanosoma species.","abstract":"Infections with Flaviviridae viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dengue virus (DENV) pose global health threats.

Statistical analysis showed an average S/B of 7.2 and Z-factor of 0.62, demonstrating assay consistency and reliability. A panel of fifteen seaweed extracts was then screened at the maximum non-toxic dose previously determined by the MTT and Neutral Red cytotoxic assays. Eight seaweed extracts were able to reduce DENV infection of at least one serotype tested. Four extracts (Phaeophyta: Canistrocarpus cervicornis, Padina gymnospora; Rhodophyta: Palisada perforate; Chlorophyta: Caulerpa racemosa) were chosen for further evaluation, and time of addition studies point that they might act at an early stage of the viral infection cycle, such as binding or internalization.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A target-free approach for dengue drug discovery is proposed based on a novel, rapid, and economic in situ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the screening of a panel of marine seaweed extracts."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4430,"details":{"paperId":"4c3208794e1577c2b4c2a7e50b1ec04c477560c9","externalIds":{"DBLP":"conf/bibe/StephanieSANT19","MAG":"3000563423","DOI":"10.1109/BIBE.2019.00046","CorpusId":"209496351"},"title":"Screening of Potential Northern African Natural Product Compounds as Dengue Virus NS5 Methyltransferase Inhibitor: An in Silico Approach","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) has emerged as one of the most prevalent viruses in sub-tropical countries, yet there is no commercial drug available to combat DENV infection effectively. The RNA-capping and replication processes of DENV are regulated by NS5 methyltransferase (MTase). Hence, NS5 MTase is believed as a promising drug target for DENV. In this research, the DENV NS5 MTase was subjected to 6,842 Northern African Natural Product Database (NANPDB) compounds through computational simulation methods. Three crystal structures of DENV NS5 MTase, which contained S-adenosylhomocysteine (PDB ID: 4V0Q), S-adenosylmethionine (PDB ID: 3P97), and sinefungin (PDB ID: 4R8S), were used as the core template of the pharmacophore mapping in the SAH-binding site of DENV NS5 MTase. Four amino acid residues (Glu111, Asp131, Val132, and Asp146) were found to strongly interacted with SAH, SAM, and SFG, indicating that these residues may hold a vital role on the catalytic activity of DENV NS5 MTase. From the docking simulations, three ligands showed favorable inhibition activities by having lower ΔGbinding value than the standard ligands. Rutin has the lowest ΔGbinding value at -12.3586 kcal/mol, followed by isorhamnetin 3-rutinoside (-12.3203 kcal/mol), and tetra-o-galloyl glucose (-12.2039 kcal/mol). Pharmacological properties of these ligands were analyzed; no potential harmful effect was detected.

DENV infection produces a spectrum of disease, most commonly causing a self-limiting flu-like illness known as dengue fever; yet with increased frequency, manifesting as life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Waning cross-protective immunity from any of the four dengue serotypes may enhance subsequent infection with another heterologous serotype to increase the probability of DHF. Decades of effort to develop dengue vaccines are reaching the finishing line with multiple candidates in clinical trials. Nevertheless, concerns remain that imbalanced immunity, due to the prolonged prime-boost schedules currently used in clinical trials, could leave some vaccinees temporarily unprotected or with increased susceptibility to enhanced disease. Here we develop a DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1) DNA vaccine with the immunodominant cross-reactive B cell epitopes associated with immune enhancement removed. We compare wild-type (WT) with this cross-reactivity reduced (CRR) vaccine and demonstrate that both vaccines are equally protective against lethal homologous DENV-1 challenge. Under conditions mimicking natural exposure prior to acquiring protective immunity, WT vaccinated mice enhanced a normally sub-lethal heterologous DENV-2 infection resulting in DHF-like disease and 95% mortality in AG129 mice. However, CRR vaccinated mice exhibited redirected serotype-specific and protective immunity, and significantly reduced morbidity and mortality not differing from naїve mice. Thus, we demonstrate in an in vivo DENV disease model, that non-protective vaccine-induced immunity can prime vaccinees for enhanced DHF-like disease and that CRR DNA immunization significantly reduces this potential vaccine safety concern.

Like many viruses, DENV has evolved potent mechanisms that abolish the antiviral response within infected cells. Nevertheless, several in vivo studies have demonstrated a key role of the innate immune response in controlling DENV infection and disease progression. Here, we report that sensing of DENV infected cells by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) triggers a robust TLR7-dependent production of IFNα, concomitant with additional antiviral responses, including inflammatory cytokine secretion and pDC maturation. We demonstrate that unlike the efficient cell-free transmission of viral infectivity, pDC activation depends on cell-to-cell contact, a feature observed for various cell types and primary cells infected by DENV, as well as West Nile virus, another member of the Flavivirus genus. We show that the sensing of DENV infected cells by pDCs requires viral envelope protein-dependent secretion and transmission of viral RNA. Consistently with the cell-to-cell sensing-dependent pDC activation, we found that DENV structural components are clustered at the interface between pDCs and infected cells. The actin cytoskeleton is pivotal for both this clustering at the contacts and pDC activation, suggesting that this structural network likely contributes to the transmission of viral components to the pDCs.

A principal component analyses (PCAs)-based framework derived from a prior vaccination study was developed. The framework was verified by successful demonstrations of known IgG signatures from a Mexico Dengue data set. Afterward the pipeline was tested upon de novo IgG and IgA libraries of Dengue patients from southern Taiwan. We discovered four infection signatures within IgG repertoires, two of which were identical to previous reports.

IgA repertoires were found more diversified among bleeders, from whom seven signature clusters were characterized. The expressions of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) and accordingly mediated class-switch activity of IgA were distinct only among the PCA-segregated bleeding group. In sum, intercontinental sharing of IgG signatures in dengue fever was demonstrated via a unified working flow. Differential regulation of IgA class-switch with associated diversity expansion plus existences of hemorrhage-restricted clusters were shown.

Flaviviruses, such as dengue and Zika, depend on extensive engagement of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis network to aid with replication, production, and secretion of virions. Here, we identify a host-centered antiviral approach by targeting these conserved ER protein quality-control processes that are required for viral infection. We find that the small-molecule regulator of ER proteostasis 147 can broadly and safely inhibit dengue and Zika infection without inducing toxicity to the host cells. Flaviviruses, including dengue and Zika, are widespread human pathogens; however, no broadly active therapeutics exist to fight infection. Recently, remodeling of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis by pharmacologic regulators, such as compound 147, was shown to correct pathologic ER imbalances associated with protein misfolding diseases. Here, we establish an additional activity of compound 147 as an effective host-centered antiviral agent against flaviviruses. Compound 147 reduces infection by attenuating the infectivity of secreted virions without causing toxicity in host cells. Compound 147 is a preferential activator of the ATF6 pathway of the ER unfolded protein response, which requires targeting of cysteine residues primarily on protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We find that the antiviral activity of 147 is independent of ATF6 induction but does require modification of reactive thiols on protein targets. Targeting PDIs and additional non-PDI targets using RNAi and other small-molecule inhibitors was unable to recapitulate the antiviral effects, suggesting a unique polypharmacology may mediate the activity. Importantly, 147 can impair infection of multiple strains of dengue and Zika virus, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that the small-molecule regulator of ER proteostasis 147 can broadly and safely inhibit dengue and Zika infection without inducing toxicity to the host cells, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":676,"details":{"paperId":"a03cb2924a9de5fb11257dd9f59a1f80151e7932","externalIds":{"MAG":"2955983654","PubMedCentral":"7223391","DOI":"10.1007/s10989-019-09888-2","CorpusId":"195811902","PubMed":"32435168"},"title":"Smp76, a Scorpine-Like Peptide Isolated from the Venom of the Scorpion Scorpio maurus palmatus, with a Potent Antiviral Activity Against Hepatitis C Virus and Dengue Virus","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A natural antiviral peptide (scorpion-like peptide Smp76) that prevents HCV and DENV infection and suppresses secondary infection, by inactivating extra-cellular infectious particles without affecting viral replication."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4474,"details":{"paperId":"8f074b8cfa9e9920f73dbaad5d910b08cf8bf599","externalIds":{"MAG":"2745800562","DOI":"10.1111/cbdd.13091","CorpusId":"32726962","PubMed":"28834304"},"title":"Sofosbuvir as treatment against dengue?","abstract":"Dengvaxia® (CTD‐TDV), the only licensed tetravalent dengue vaccine by Sanofi Pasteur, was made available since 2015.

Accordingly, the development of nucleoside inhibitors specific to dengue viral polymerase that perturb dengue infection has been studied by many. Alternatively, we have used a marketed anti‐HCV prodrug sofosbuvir to study its in silico and in vitro effects against dengue. As a result, the active metabolite of sofosbuvir (GS‐461203) was predicted to bind to the catalytic motif (Gly‐Asp‐Asp) of dengue viral polymerase with binding affinity of −6.9 kcal/mol. Furthermore, sofosbuvir demonstrated excellent in vitro viral inhibition with an EC90 of 0.4 μm.

It is closely related to the mosquito-borne yellow fever, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses, and vaccination with an inactivated whole-virus vaccine can effectively prevent clinical disease. Neutralizing antibodies are directed to the viral envelope protein (E) and an accepted correlate of immunity. However, data on the specificities of CD4+ T cells that recognize epitopes in the viral structural proteins and thus can provide direct help to the B cells producing E-specific antibodies are lacking. We therefore conducted a study on the CD4+ T cell response against the virion proteins in vaccinated people in comparison to TBE patients. The data obtained with overlapping peptides in interleukin-2 (IL-2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays were analyzed in relation to the three-dimensional structures of the capsid (C) and E proteins as well as to epitope predictions based on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II peptide affinities. In the C protein, peptides corresponding to two out of four alpha helices dominated the response in both vaccinees and patients, whereas in the E protein concordance of immunodominance was restricted to peptides of a single domain (domain III). Epitope predictions were much better for C than for E and were especially erroneous for the transmembrane regions.

It is closely related to yellow fever, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses, and vaccination with an inactivated vaccine can effectively prevent disease. Both vaccination and natural infection induce the formation of antibodies to a viral surface protein that neutralize the infectivity of the virus and mediate protection. B lymphocytes synthesizing these antibodies require help from other lymphocytes (helper T cells) which recognize small peptides derived from proteins contained in the viral particle. Which of these peptides dominate immune responses to vaccination and infection, however, was unknown.

Results: Dengue virus immune complexes induce inflammatory cytokine expression by activating spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) during antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Conclusion: Syk-mediated activation of ERK1/2 elevates cytokine production during antibody-enhanced dengue infection. Significance: Targeting Syk and ERK1/2 has therapeutic potential during antibody-enhanced dengue infection. Approximately 500,000 people are hospitalized with severe dengue illness annually. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection is believed to contribute to the pathogenic cytokine storm described in severe dengue patients, but the precise signaling pathways contributing to elevated cytokine production are not elucidated. IL-1β is a potent inflammatory cytokine that is frequently elevated during severe dengue, and the unique dual regulation of IL-1β provides an informative model to study ADE-induced cytokines. This work utilizes patient-derived anti-DENV mAbs and primary human monocytes to study ADE-induced IL-1β and other cytokines. ADE of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) elevates mature IL-1β secretion by monocytes independent of DENV replication by 4 h postinoculation (hpi). Prior to this, DENV immune complexes activate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) within 1 hpi. Syk induces elevated IL1B, TNF, and IL6 mRNA by 2 hpi. Syk mediates elevated IL-1β secretion by activating ERK1/2, and both Syk and ERK1/2 inhibitors ablated ADE-induced IL-1β secretion. Maturation of pro-IL-1β during ADE requires caspase-1 and NLRP3, but caspase-1 is suboptimally increased by ADE and can be significantly enhanced by a typical inflammasome agonist, ATP. Importantly, this inflammatory Syk-ERK signaling axis requires DENV immune complexes, because DENV-2 in the presence of serotype-matched anti-DENV-2 mAb, but not anti-DENV-1 mAb, activates Syk, ERK, and IL-1β secretion. This study provides evidence that DENV-2 immune complexes activate Syk to mediate elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines.

The 3′ NCR of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus can be divided into a variable region that is highly heterogeneous in length among strains of TBE virus and in certain cases includes an internal poly(A) tract and a 3′-terminal conserved core element that is believed to fold as a whole into a well-defined secondary structure. We have now investigated the genetic stability of the TBE virus 3′ NCR and its influence on viral growth properties and virulence. We observed spontaneous deletions in the variable region during growth of TBE virus in cell culture and in mice. These deletions varied in size and location but always included the internal poly(A) element of the TBE virus 3′ NCR and never extended into the conserved 3′-terminal core element. Subsequently, we constructed specific deletion mutants by using infectious cDNA clones with the entire variable region and increasing segments of the core element removed. A virus mutant lacking the entire variable region was indistinguishable from wild-type virus with respect to cell culture growth properties and virulence in the mouse model. In contrast, even small extensions of the deletion into the core element led to significant biological effects. Deletions extending to nucleotides 10826, 10847, and 10870 caused distinct attenuation in mice without measurable reduction of cell culture growth properties, which, however, were significantly restricted when the deletion was extended to nucleotide 10919. An even larger deletion (to nucleotide 10994) abolished viral viability. In spite of their high degree of attenuation, these mutants efficiently induced protective immune responses even at low inoculation doses. Thus, 3′-NCR deletions represent a useful technique for achieving stable attenuation of flaviviruses that can be included in the rational design of novel flavivirus live vaccines.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"3′-NCR deletions represent a useful technique for achieving stable attenuation of flaviviruses that can be included in the rational design of novel flavivirus live vaccines."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1137,"details":{"paperId":"81ad9b987eaac284d0c580d28689ed5d2d6ec3f0","externalIds":{"MAG":"1994720127","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.04.007","CorpusId":"5258873","PubMed":"25896272"},"title":"Stabilization of dengue virus polymerase in de novo initiation assay provides advantages for compound screening.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A higher hit-rate was obtained for the de novo initiation assay compared to the elongation assay, and the stabilized apo-enzyme has the advantage of providing additional chemical starting entities for inhibiting this enzyme."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":49,"details":{"paperId":"585ff5f9083b79998d354e5321b877539b8b3b8d","externalIds":{"MAG":"2925710251","DOI":"10.1002/chem.201900591","CorpusId":"85565688","PubMed":"30924209"},"title":"Stachyonic Acid: A Dengue Virus Inhibitor from Basilicum polystachyon.","abstract":"Stachyonic acid A, arising from the first in-depth phytochemical investigation of the herb Basilicum polystachyon, was found to display potent inhibitory activity against dengue virus, with limited cytotoxicity.

In this study, we thoroughly characterize the structural footprint of an anti-idiotype antibody (E1) specific for a potent, fully human DENV serotype 1-specific antibody, termed HM14c10, derived from a recovered patient. The crystal structure at a resolution of 2.5 Å of a complex between the Fab fragments of E1 and HM14c10 provides the first detailed molecular comparison of an anti-idiotype paratope specific for a human antibody with its analogous epitope, a discontinuous quaternary structure located at the surface of the viral particle that spans adjacent envelope (E) proteins. This comparison reveals that the footprints left by E1 and E on HM14c10 largely overlap, explaining why the formation of binary complexes is mutually exclusive. Structural mimicry of the DENV E epitope by the E1 combining site is achieved via the formation of numerous interactions with heavy chain complementarity domain regions (CDRs) of HM14c10, while fewer interactions are observed with its light chain than for the E protein. We show that E1 can be utilized to detect HM14c10-like antibodies in sera from patients who recovered from DENV-1, infection suggesting that this is a public (common) idiotype. These data demonstrate the utility of employing an anti-idiotype antibody to monitor a patient's specific immune responses and suggest routes for the improvement of E “mimicry” by E1 by increasing its recognition of the Fab HM14c10 light chain CDRs.

Dengue remains a significant public health problem, because protection conferred by this vaccine against the four circulating serotypes is uneven. Reliable tools must be developed to measure the immune responses of individuals exposed to DENV either via viral infection or through vaccination. Anti-idiotypic antibodies provide precision tools for analyzing the pharmacokinetics of antibodies in an immune response and also for measuring the amount of circulating anti-infective therapeutic antibodies. Here, we characterize how an anti-idiotypic antibody (E1) binds antibody HM14c10, which potently neutralizes DENV serotype 1.

To date, the structural biology of NS1 is limited, which has hampered a complete understanding of its functions. We describe the previously unidentified high-resolution structure of the C-terminal half of West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus-1 (NS1172–352) NS1 proteins and a separate structure of WNV NS1172–352 with a protective antibody Fab. NS1172–352 forms a head-to-head dimer and adopts a unique fold with an extended β-sheet platform and opposing loop face. These structures have allowed us to develop an architectural model for NS1 assembly and function. The Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a conserved, membrane-associated and secreted glycoprotein with replication and immune evasion functions. Secreted NS1 is a hexameric, barrel-shaped lipoprotein that can bind back to the plasma membrane of cells. Antibodies targeting cell surface-associated NS1 can be protective in vivo in a manner dependent on Fc effector functions. We describe here the crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment (residues 172–352) of West Nile (WNV) and Dengue virus NS1 proteins at 1.85 and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. NS1172–352 assembles as a unique rod-shaped dimer composed of a 16-stranded β-platform flanked on one face by protruding connecting loops. We also determined the 3.0 Å resolution structure of WNV NS1172–352 with the protective 22NS1 antibody Fab, which engages the loop-face of the rod. The head-to-head NS1172–352 dimer we observe in crystal lattices is supported by multiangle light and small-angle X-ray scattering studies. We used the available cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction to develop a pseudoatomic model of the NS1 hexamer. The model was constructed with the NS1172–352 dimeric rod aligned with the long axis of the barrel, and with the loop-face oriented away from the core.

Protection against DENV and other related flaviviruses is associated with the development of antibodies against the viral envelope (E) protein. Although prior studies have characterized the neutralizing activity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against DENV type 2 (DENV-2), none have compared simultaneously the inhibitory activity against a genetically diverse range of strains in vitro, the protective capacity in animals, and the localization of epitopes. Here, with the goal of identifying MAbs that can serve as postexposure therapy, we investigated in detail the functional activity of a large panel of new anti-DENV-2 mouse MAbs. Binding sites were mapped by yeast surface display and neutralization escape, cell culture inhibition assays were performed with homologous and heterologous strains, and prophylactic and therapeutic activity was evaluated with two mouse models. Protective MAbs localized to epitopes on the lateral ridge of domain I (DI), the dimer interface, lateral ridge, and fusion loop of DII, and the lateral ridge, C-C′ loop, and A strand of DIII. Several MAbs inefficiently inhibited at least one DENV-2 strain of a distinct genotype, suggesting that recognition of neutralizing epitopes varies with strain diversity.

ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) are closely related, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection between cocirculating ZIKV and DENV may exacerbate disease. Despite these serious threats, there are currently no approved antiviral drugs against ZIKV and DENV. The NS2B-NS3 viral protease is an attractive antiviral target because it plays a pivotal role in polyprotein cleavage, which is required for viral replication. Thus, we sought to identify novel inhibitors of the NS2B-NS3 protease. To that aim, we performed structure-based virtual screening using 467,000 structurally diverse chemical compounds. Then, a fluorescence-based protease inhibition assay was used to test whether the selected candidates inhibited ZIKV protease activity. Among the 123 candidate inhibitors selected from virtual screening, compound 1 significantly inhibited ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease activity in vitro. In addition, compound 1 effectively inhibited ZIKV and DENV infection of human cells. Molecular docking analysis suggested that compound 1 binds to the NS2B-NS3 protease of ZIKV and DENV.

The SPD was prepared from the root of Goniothalamus umbrosus after purification with petroleum ether. The isolated SPD was then subjected to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses for structure validation. The cytotoxicity of the SPD was evaluated using a cell viability assay, while the anti-viral activity of the SPD towards DENV-2 was confirmed by conducting a foci reduction assay which involved virus yield reduction, time-of-addition, and time removal assays. Transcriptomic analysis via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using the DENV-2 E gene was conducted to investigate the level of gene transcript. Immunocytochemistry analysis was used to investigate the effects of SPD treatment on protein E expression. Finally, software molecular docking of the SPD and E protein was also performed. The cytotoxicity assay confirmed that the SPD was not toxic to Vero cells, even at the highest concentration tested. In the time-of-addition assay, more than 80% foci reduction was observed when SPDs were administered at 2 h post-infection (hpi), and the reduction percentage then dropped with the delay of the treatment time, suggesting the inhibition of the early replication cycle. However, the time removal assay showed that more than 80% reduction could only be observed after 96 h post-treatment with the SPD. Treatment with the SPD reduced the progeny infectivity when treated for 24 h and was dose-dependent. The result showed that transcript level of the E gene in infected cells treated with the SPD was reduced compared to infected cells without treatment. In immunocytochemistry analysis, the DENV-2 E protein exhibited similar expression trends, shown by the gene transcription level. Molecular docking showed that the SPD can interact with E protein through hydrogen bonds and other interactions. Overall, this study showed that SPDs have the potential to be anti-DENV-2 via a reduction in viral progeny infectivity and a reduction in the expression of the DENV-2 E gene and protein at different phases of viral replication. SPDs should be further researched to be developed into an effective anti-viral treatment, particularly for early-phase dengue viral infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Investigation of the anti-viral effect of a styrylpyrone derivative (SPD) called goniothalamin and the effects on the dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) replication cycle showed that SPDs have the potential to be anti-DENv-2 via a reduction in viral progeny infectivity and a Reduction in the expression of the DENV-1 E gene and protein at different phases of viral replication."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2558,"details":{"paperId":"6b16a079bbe0437c713fdb8e6b802b1bd88bae64","externalIds":{"MAG":"2559906772","DOI":"10.1016/j.virusres.2016.12.003","CorpusId":"46804093","PubMed":"27939945"},"title":"Substitution of the precursor peptide prevents anti-prM antibody-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that anti-prM antibody-mediated ADE can be prevented by JEV pr peptide replacement and is contributed further to research on the pathogenesis of DENV infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2739,"details":{"paperId":"179e6f356839cffad6a7221a7a4e565f171c21ee","externalIds":{"MAG":"2053857786","DOI":"10.1016/S0264-410X(03)00488-2","CorpusId":"363729","PubMed":"14505913"},"title":"Substitution of the structural genes of dengue virus type 4 with those of type 2 results in chimeric vaccine candidates which are attenuated for mosquitoes, mice, and rhesus monkeys.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The satisfactory level of attenuation and immunogenicity achieved by the ME containing DEN2/4delta 30 chimeric virus, as well as its very low infectivity for mosquitoes, make it a vaccine candidate suitable for evaluation in phase I clinical trials."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4272,"details":{"paperId":"b891a5e3710c5336d95acf2c1f3b49b9f35c1bae","externalIds":{"MAG":"1979820507","DOI":"10.1099/VIR.0.82455-0","CorpusId":"443757","PubMed":"17485535"},"title":"Substitution or deletion mutations between nt 54 and 70 in the 5' non-coding region of dengue type 2 virus produce variable effects on virus viability.","abstract":"A C57U nucleotide mutation in a predicted RNA stem structure (nt 11-16/56-61) of the 5' non-coding region (5'NCR) of dengue 2 (DEN-2) 16681 virus is partially attenuating, but unstable during serial passage of certain candidate DEN-2 PDK-53-based vaccine viruses containing this mutation.

While the detailed mechanism of antibody enhanced disease severity is unclear, evidence suggests that it is associated with both increased DENV infectivity and suppression of the type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Therefore, it is imperative for us to understand the intracellular mechanisms altered during ADE infection to decipher the mechanism of severe pathogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings In this present work, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and gene array analysis were conducted to determine whether DENV-antibody complex infection exerts a suppressive effect on the expression and/or function of the pathogen recognition patterns, focusing on the TLR-signaling pathway. We show here that FcγRI and FcγRIIa synergistically facilitated entry of DENV-antibody complexes into monocytic THP-1 cells. Ligation between DENV-antibody complexes and FcR not only down regulated TLRs gene expression but also up regulated SARM, TANK, and negative regulators of the NF-κB pathway, resulting in suppression of innate responses but increased viral production. These results were confirmed by blocking with anti-FcγRI or anti-FcγRIIa antibodies which reduced viral production, up-regulated IFN-β synthesis, and increased gene expression in the TLR-dependent signaling pathway. The negative impact of DENV-ADE infection on the TLR-dependent pathway was strongly supported by gene array screening which revealed that both MyD88-dependent and –independent signaling molecules were down regulated during DENV-ADE infection. Importantly, the same phenomenon was seen in PBMC of secondary DHF/DSS patients but not in PBMC of DF patients. Conclusions/Significance Our present work demonstrates the mechanism by which DENV uses pre-existing immune mediators to defeat the principal activating pathway of innate defense resulting in suppression of an array of innate immune responses. Interestingly, this phenomenon specifically occurred during the severe form of DENV infection but not in the mild form of disease.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The present work demonstrates the mechanism by which DENV uses pre-existing immune mediators to defeat the principal activating pathway of innate defense resulting in suppression of an array of innate immune responses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":539,"details":{"paperId":"498a37b35fdea4a935e2ce27b85593bd0f742a87","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s00430-014-0334-5","CorpusId":"253985073"},"title":"Subversion of early innate antiviral responses during antibody-dependent enhancement of Dengue virus infection induces severe disease in immunocompetent mice","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated here that B cells play a pivotal role in host responses against primary DENV infection in mice and that humoral responses unleashed during DENV infections can exert protective or pathological outcomes and provide insight into the pathogenesis of this important human pathogen."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3008,"details":{"paperId":"c8fd5833a928d70331a8eb0311ab8e9a0c235624","externalIds":{"MAG":"2092133388","DOI":"10.1038/nature10356","CorpusId":"4316652","PubMed":"21866160"},"title":"Successful establishment of Wolbachia in Aedes populations to suppress dengue transmission","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work describes how the wMel Wolbachia infection, introduced into the dengue vector Aedes aegypti from Drosophila melanogaster, successfully invaded two natural A. aagypti populations in Australia, reaching near-fixation in a few months following releases of wMel-infected A.A. ae Egyptian adults."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7518,"details":{"paperId":"88d237f9540bcfeed5a4f22dc0d156d51bb9b5b7","externalIds":{"MAG":"3087770507","PubMedCentral":"7545740","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2020.585133","CorpusId":"221882568","PubMed":"33101316"},"title":"Successive Immunization With Epitope-Decreasing Dengue Antigens Induced Conservative Anti-Dengue Immune Responses","abstract":"Repeated homologous antigen immunization has been hypothesized to hinder antibody diversification, whereas sequential immunization with heterologous immunogens can educate B cell differentiations towards conserved residues thereby facilitating the generation of cross-reactive immunity.

CRDS was shown to inhibit the DENV replication very efficiently in different cells in vitro. Minimal effective concentration of CRDS was as low as 0.1 µg/mL in LLC-MK2 cells, and toxicity was observed only at concentrations over 10 mg/mL. CRDS can also inhibit DENV-1, 3, and 4 efficiently.

Time of addition experiments demonstrated that the compound not only inhibited viral infection at the host cell binding step, but also at an early post-attachment step of entry (membrane fusion). The direct binding of CRDS to DENV was suggested by an evident reduction in the viral titers after interaction of the virus with CRDS following an ultrafiltration device separation, as well as after virus adsorption to an alkyl CRDS-coated membrane filter. The electron microscopic features also showed that CRDS interacted directly with the viral envelope, and caused changes to the viral surface. CRDS also potently inhibited DENV infection in DC-SIGN expressing cells as well as the antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV-2 infection.

As with other RNA viruses, daunting challenges to antiviral design exist due to the high error rates of RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Indeed, treatment of dengue virus infection with a nucleoside analog resulted in the expected genetic selection of resistant viruses in tissue culture and in mice. However, when the function of the oligomeric core protein was inhibited, no detectable selection of drug resistance in tissue culture or in mice was detected, despite the presence of drug-resistant variants in the population. Suppressed selection of drug-resistant virus correlated with cooligomerization of the targeted drug-susceptible and drug-resistant core proteins. The concept of “dominant drug targets,” in which inhibition of oligomeric viral assemblages leads to the formation of drug-susceptible chimeras, can therefore be used to prevent the outgrowth of drug resistance during dengue virus infection. IMPORTANCE Drug resistance is a major hurdle in the development of effective antivirals, especially those directed at RNA viruses. We have found that one can use the concept of the genetic dominance of defective subunits to “turn cousins into enemies,” i.e., to thwart the outgrowth of drug-resistant viral genomes as soon as they are generated.

The release of Wolbachia into wild populations of mosquitoes is an innovative biocontrol effort to suppress the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) to humans, most notably dengue virus. The success of the Wolbachia-based approach hinges upon the stable persistence of the ‘pathogen blocking’ effect, whose mechanistic basis is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that Wolbachia may affect viral replication via a combination of competition for host resources and activation of host immunity. The evolution of resistance against Wolbachia and pathogen blocking in the mosquito or the virus could reduce the public health impact of the symbiont releases. Here, we investigate if dengue 3 virus (DENV-3) is capable of accumulating adaptive mutations that improve its replicative capacity during serial passage in Wolbachia wMel-infected cells. During the passaging regime, viral isolates in Wolbachia-infected cells exhibited greater variation in viral loads compared to controls. The viral loads of these isolates declined rapidly during passaging due to the blocking effects of Wolbachia carriage, with several being lost all together and the remainder recovering to low but stable levels. We attempted to sequence the genomes of the surviving passaged isolates but, given their low abundance, were unable to obtain sufficient depth of coverage for evolutionary analysis. In contrast, viral loads in Wolbachia-free control cells were consistently high during passaging. The surviving isolates passaged in the presence of Wolbachia exhibited a reduced ability to replicate even in Wolbachia-free cells.

Recently, crystal structures and substrate preferences of NS2B-NS3pro from Dengue and West Nile viruses (DV and WNV) were determined. We established that the presence of Gly-Gly at the P1′-P2′ positions is optimal for cleavage by WNV NS3pro, whereas DV NS3pro tolerates well the presence of bulky residues at either P1′ or P2′. Structure-based modeling suggests that Arg76 and Pro131-Thr132 limit the P1′-P2′ subsites and restrict the cleavage preferences of the WNV enzyme. In turn, Leu76 and Lys131-Pro132 widen the specificity of DV NS3pro. Guided by these structural models, we expressed and purified mutant WNV NS2B-NS3pro and evaluated cleavage preferences by using positional scanning of the substrate peptides in which the P4-P1 and the P3′-P4′ positions were fixed and the P1′ and P2′ positions were each randomized. We established that WNV R76L and P131K-T132P mutants acquired DV-like cleavage preferences, whereas T52V had no significant effect.

Currently, there is no clinically approved vaccine or antiviral for DENV. Combination therapy is a common practice in antiviral treatment and a potential approach to search for new treatments for infectious pathogens. In this study, we performed a combination treatment in cell culture by using three distinct classes of inhibitors, including ribavirin (a guanosine analog with several antiviral mechanisms), brequinar (a pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor), and INX-08189 (a guanosine analog). The compound pairs were evaluated for antiviral activity by use of a DENV-2 luciferase replicon assay. Our result indicated that the combination of ribavirin and INX-08189 exhibited strong antiviral synergy. This result suggests that synergy can be achieved with compound pairs in which one compound suppresses the synthesis of the nucleoside for which the other compound is a corresponding nucleoside analog. In addition, we found that treatment of cells with brequinar alone could activate interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs); furthermore, brequinar and NITD-982 (another pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor) potentiated interferon-induced ISRE activation.

The modified vaccine construct expressed antigen that was colocalized with endogenous LAMP in lysosomal vesicles of transfected cells, whereas the antigen expressed from the unmodified construct was not. It was hypothesized that targeting of antigen to the lysosomal compartment will increase antigen presentation by MHC class II, leading to stronger CD4-mediated immune responses.

Coimmunization of mice with a plasmid expressing murine GM-CSF enhanced the antibody response obtained with either the unmodified or the modified construct alone.

Here, we report an epitope grafting mutational analysis of the serospecificity and cross-serospecificity of the envelope protein domain 3 (ED3; 107 residues, ∼11.6kDa), which contains two major putative epitopes of DENVs. To this end, we constructed ED3 from DENV3 (3ED3) and DENV4 (4ED3), and six epitope-grafted variants, where we transferred epitope 1 (L304I, K305D, V309M, and S310A) and/or epitope 2 (D383N, K384S, K387T, and N389H) of 4ED3 onto 3ED3 and vice versa. Mice immunization using 3ED3 and 4ED3 generated serotype-specific antisera, as expected. Similarly, most epitope-grafted ED3s produced antisera serospecific to the template ED3 with little or no cross-recognition of ED3 of the serotype from which the epitopes were taken. This result indicated that a mere grafting of the epitope was not sufficient to transfer serospecificity, contrary to our expectations. However, one epitope grafted ED3 mutant, where epitope 1 of 3ED3 was grafted onto 4ED3 (4ED3epi1), generated antisera that was serospecific to both 4ED3 and 3ED3.

We have previously constructed two plasmids, pE1D2, and pcTPANS1, encoding the envelope (E) ectodomain (domains I, II, and III) and the non-structural 1 (NS1) protein of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), respectively. In the present work, we analyzed the induction of the cellular response in mice immunized with these DNA vaccines and identified the immunogenic peptides. Vaccinated BALB/c mice became protected against a lethal challenge of DENV2. Depletion of CD4+ cells in vaccinated animals almost completely abolished protection elicited by both vaccines. In contrast, a significant number of pE1D2- and pcTPANS1-immunized mice survived virus challenge after depletion of CD8+ cells, although some animals presented morbidity. To identify immunogenic peptides recognized by T cells, we stimulated splenocytes with overlapping peptide libraries covering the E and NS1 proteins and evaluated the production of IFN-γ by ELISPOT. We detected two and three immunodominant epitopes in the E and NS1 proteins, respectively, and four additional NS1-derived peptides after virus challenge. Characterization by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) revealed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were involved in IFN-γ and TNF-α production. The IFN-γ ICS confirmed reaction of almost all E-derived peptides before challenge and identified other epitopes after infection. All NS1-derived peptides were able to elicit IFN-γ production in CD4+ cells, while only a few peptides induced expression of this cytokine in CD8+ T lymphocytes. Interestingly, we observed an increase in the frequency of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells producing TNF-α after immunization with the pE1D2 and challenge with DENV2, while lymphocytes from pcTPANS1-vaccinated animals maintained ordinary TNF-α production after virus infection. We also assessed the recognition of E and NS1 immunogenic peptides in C57BL/6 mice due to the difference in MHC haplotype expression.

The lone licensed dengue vaccine was not effective to prevent the disease globally. Many dengue vaccines are under clinical trial but there are concerns about the trial reports on safety and efficacy of vaccine.

Nowadays, no effective treatment is available to overcome the disease due to the level of dengue virus pathogeneses. A novel treatment method such as antiviral drug is highly necessary for coping with the dengue disease. Envelope protein is one of the non-structural proteins of DENV, which engaged in the viral fusion process. It penetrates into the host cell to transfer its genetic material into the targeted cell followed by replication and establishment of new virus. Thus, the envelope protein can be utilized as the antiviral inhibitor target. The fusion process is mediated by the conformational change in the protein structure from dimer to trimer state. The previous research showed the existing cavity on the dimer structure of the envelope protein. The existing ligand could get into cavity of the envelope protein, stabilize the dimer structure or hamper the transition of dimer protein into trimer. In this fashion, the fusion process can be prevented. The aim of this research is designing the cyclic peptide with prolin-prolin bond as fusion inhibitor of DENV envelope protein through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The screening of 3,883 cyclic peptides, each of them connected by prolin-prolin bond, through molecular docking resulted in five best ligands. The result showed that PYRRP was the best ligand. PAWRP was also chosen as the best ligand because it showed good affinity with protein cavity. Stability of ligand-protein complex was analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation. The result showed that PYRRP ligand was able to support the stability of DENV envelope protein dimer structure at 310 K and 312 K. While PAWRP ligand actively formed complex with the DENV envelope protein at 310 K compared to 312 K. Thus the PYRRP ligand has a potential to be developed as DENV fusion inhibitor.

The infection is often associated with serious complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), in which both viral and host factors have been implicated. RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent antiviral strategy and a potential therapeutic option for dengue if a feasible strategy can be developed for delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, the major in vivo targets of the virus and also the source of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we show that a dendritic cell-targeting 12-mer peptide (DC3) fused to nona-d-arginine (9dR) residues (DC3-9dR) delivers siRNA and knocks down endogenous gene expression in heterogenous DC subsets, (monocyte-derived DCs [MDDCs], CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell [HSC])-derived Langerhans DCs, and peripheral blood DCs). Moreover, DC3-9dR-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting a highly conserved sequence in the dengue virus envelope gene (siFvED) effectively suppressed dengue virus replication in MDDCs and macrophages. In addition, DC-specific delivery of siRNA targeting the acute-phase cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which plays a major role in dengue pathogenesis, either alone or in combination with an antiviral siRNA, significantly reduced virus-induced production of the cytokine in MDDCs. Finally to validate the strategy in vivo, we tested the ability of the peptide to target human DCs in the NOD/SCID/IL-2Rγ−/− mouse model engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HuHSC mice). Treatment of mice by intravenous (i.v.) injection of DC3-9dR-complexed siRNA targeting TNF-α effectively suppressed poly(I:C)-induced TNF-α production by DCs.

Virally encoded NS2B/3, a two-subunit serine proteinase, is responsible for many cleavages within the viral polyprotein. We demonstrate that two cleavage sites flanking NS3 and one that is internal are self-processing. This strict intramolecular cleavage dictates that, if uncleaved precursors can inhibit viral growth, this phenotype will be trans-dominant. Indeed, a mutation that abrogates one of the self-processing sites caused trans-dominant inhibition of wild-type virus. This site is also the most susceptible to a dengue proteinase inhibitor, providing a compelling rationale for its efficacy. We suggest that explicit targeting of specific intramolecular cleavage sites will be an effective antiviral strategy that can suppress multiple variants in an intracellular quasispecies. Many positive-strand RNA viruses translate their genomes as single polyproteins that are processed by host and viral proteinases to generate all viral protein products. Among these is dengue virus, which encodes the serine proteinase NS2B/3 responsible for seven different cleavages in the polyprotein. NS2B/3 has been the subject of many directed screens to find chemical inhibitors, of which the compound ARDP0006 is among the most effective at inhibiting viral growth. We show that at least three cleavages in the dengue polyprotein are exclusively intramolecular. By definition, such a cis-acting defect cannot be rescued in trans. This creates the possibility that a drug-susceptible or inhibited proteinase can be genetically dominant, inhibiting the outgrowth of drug-resistant virus via precursor accumulation. Indeed, an NS3-G459L variant that is incapable of cleavage at the internal NS3 junction dominantly inhibited negative-strand RNA synthesis of wild-type virus present in the same cell. This internal NS3 cleavage site is the junction most inhibited by ARDP0006, making it likely that the accumulation of toxic precursors, not inhibition of proteolytic activity per se, explains the antiviral efficacy of this compound in restraining viral growth. We argue that intramolecularly cleaving proteinases are promising drug targets for viruses that encode polyproteins. The most effective inhibitors will specifically target cleavage sites required for processing precursors that exert trans-dominant inhibition.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is argued that intramolecularly cleaving proteinases are promising drug targets for viruses that encode polyproteins and the most effective inhibitors will specifically target cleavage sites required for processing precursors that exert trans-dominant inhibition."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2262,"details":{"paperId":"0f8fbc6184c3668935e1eff31be184e52cd6b79f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2128573854","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.03.009","CorpusId":"8301202","PubMed":"23499580"},"title":"Targeting of envelope domain III protein of DENV type 2 to DEC-205 receptor elicits neutralizing antibodies in mice.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Findings suggest that this strategy has potential for development of an effective vaccine against dengue virus without the presence of adjuvants."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5676,"details":{"paperId":"60687da6f736a0bcaed39adc36ec3a97121cd7af","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3000392","MAG":"2039799108","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2199-11-84","CorpusId":"8635048","PubMed":"21078188"},"title":"Targeting of highly conserved Dengue virus sequences with anti-Dengue virus trans-splicing group I introns","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"These novel αDENV-GrpI introns provide a striking alternative to other RNA based approaches for the transgenic suppression of DENV in transformed mosquito cells and tissues."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4341,"details":{"paperId":"199b73d94d2ea9482ae00f32f6f8dc3b3e9727b6","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8959599","DOI":"10.1101/2021.11.02.466887","CorpusId":"243471234","PubMed":"35293862"},"title":"Targeting the Annexin A1-FPR2/ALX pathway for host-directed therapy in dengue disease","abstract":"Host immune responses contribute to dengue’s pathogenesis and severity, yet the possibility that failure in endogenous inflammation resolution pathways could characterise the disease has not been contemplated.

We hypothesised that inadequate AnxA1 engagement underlies the cytokine storm and vascular pathologies associated with dengue disease. Levels of AnxA1 were examined in the plasma of dengue patients and infected mice. Immunocompetent, IFNα/βR-/-, AnxA1-/- and FPR2/ALX-/- mice were infected with Dengue virus (DENV) and treated with the AnxA1 mimetic peptide Ac2-26 for analysis. Additionally, the effect of Ac2-26 on DENV-induced MC degranulation was assessed in vitro and in vivo. We observed that circulating levels of AnxA1 were reduced in dengue patients and DENV-infected mice. While the absence of AnxA1 or its receptor FPR2/ALX aggravated illness in infected mice, treatment with AnxA1 agonistic peptide attenuated disease manifestations. Both clinical outcomes were attributed to modulation of DENV-mediated viral load-independent MC degranulation.

Attempts to control such infection are being made, and the development of a vaccine is a World Health Organization priority. Among the proteins being tested as vaccine candidates in preclinical settings is the non-structural protein 1 (NS1). In the present study, we tested the immune responses generated by targeting the NS1 protein to two different dendritic cell populations. Dendritic cells (DCs) are important antigen presenting cells, and targeting proteins to maturing DCs has proved to be an efficient means of immunization. Antigen targeting is accomplished by the use of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against a DC cell surface receptor fused to the protein of interest. We used two mAbs (αDEC205 and αDCIR2) to target two distinct DC populations, expressing either DEC205 or DCIR2 endocytic receptors, respectively, in mice. The fusion mAbs were successfully produced, bound to their respective receptors, and were used to immunize BALB/c mice in the presence of polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)), as a DC maturation stimulus. We observed induction of strong anti-NS1 antibody responses and similar antigen binding affinity irrespectively of the DC population targeted. Nevertheless, the IgG1/IgG2a ratios were different between mouse groups immunized with αDEC-NS1 and αDCIR2-NS1 mAbs. When we tested the induction of cellular immune responses, the number of IFN-γ producing cells was higher in αDEC-NS1 immunized animals. In addition, mice immunized with the αDEC-NS1 mAb were significantly protected from a lethal intracranial challenge with the DENV2 NGC strain when compared to mice immunized with αDCIR2-NS1 mAb.

Due to the high sequence similarity of the viral proteins and the purported cross-reactive immune responses against the viruses, we envisioned a common multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against both viruses by adopting a novel approach of identifying “immunogenic hotspots”. These stretches of the structural and non-structural proteins are enriched with MHC class I and class II supertype-restricted T cell epitopes, and B cell epitopes, in addition to being highly conserved between different DENV serotypes and ZIKV. Such an approach ensures inclusion of multiple overlapping T and B cell epitopes common to both viruses, and also warrants high population coverage. Importantly, epitopes known to cause antibody-dependent-enhancement of infection have been excluded. These immunogenic hotspots have then been stitched together with linkers in-silico along with an adjuvant, CTxB to develop the MEV candidate. Four structural models of the MEV were selected on the basis of conformational preservation of CTxB, and their biophysical parameters, which also conserved the immunogenicity of the multiple epitopes.

To facilitate further applications of these vectors in the form of virus-like particles (VLPs), we have now generated a stable BHK packaging cell line, tetKUNCprME, carrying a Kunjin structural gene cassette under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Withdrawal of tetracycline from the medium resulted in production of Kunjin structural proteins that were capable of packaging transfected and self-amplified Kunjin replicon RNA into the secreted VLPs at titers of up to 1.6 × 109 VLPs per ml. Furthermore, secreted KUN replicon VLPs from tetKUNCprME cells could be harvested continuously for as long as 10 days after RNA transfection, producing a total yield of more than 1010 VLPs per 106 transfected cells. Passaging of VLPs on Vero cells or intracerebral injection into 2- to 4-day-old suckling mice illustrated the complete absence of any infectious Kunjin virus. tetKUNCprME cells were also capable of packaging replicon RNA from closely and distantly related flaviviruses, West Nile virus and dengue virus type 2, respectively.

At present, it is unclear whether Zika virus changed its pathogenicity or whether the huge number of infections allowed the recognition of a previously cryptic pathogenic property. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent data on the molecular antigenic structure of Zika virus in the context of antibody-mediated neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, a phenomenon that has been implicated in the development of severe disease caused by the related dengue viruses. Emphasis is given to epitopes of antibodies that potently neutralize Zika virus and also to epitopes that provide antigenic links to other important human-pathogenic flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. The antigenic cross talk between Zika and dengue viruses appears to be of special importance, since they cocirculate in many regions of endemicity and sequential infections are likely to occur frequently.

We conducted an in vitro laboratory experiment of several extracts from Indonesian herbs combined with in silico analysis. The extracts were evaluated for safety and antiviral activity in Huh7it-1 cell lines, using a single dose of 20 µg/mL and dose-dependent (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 µg/mL) of plant extracts against dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) NGC strain. The DMSO 0.1% was used as a negative control. The cytotoxic aspect was assessed by counting the cell viability, while the antiviral activity was calculated by counting the average inhibition. The selectivity index (SI) of plant extracts were performed from a ratio of CC50/EC50 value. In silico analysis was conducted to determine the free energy of binding between NS5 of dengue virus with bioactive compounds contained in Myristica fatua, Cymbopogon citratus and Acorus calamus extract plants.

Therefore, the search for compounds of natural origin with antiviral activity is an important area of research. In the present study, three compounds were isolated and identified from seeds of Tabernaemontana cymosa plants. The in vitro antiviral effect of those compounds and voacangine against different DENV strains was assessed using different experimental approaches: compounds added before the infection (Pre), at the same time with the virus (Trans), after the infection (Post) or compounds present in all moments of the experiment (Pre-Trans-Post, Combined treatment). In silico studies (docking and molecular dynamics) were also performed to explain the possible antiviral mechanisms. The identified compounds were three structural analogs of voacangine (voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine, rupicoline and 3-oxo-voacangine). In the Pre-treatment, only voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited the infection caused by the DENV-2/NG strain (16.4% and 29.6% infection, respectively). In the Trans-treatment approach, voacangine, voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited the infection in both DENV-2/NG (11.2%, 80.4% and 75.7% infection, respectively) and DENV-2/16681 infection models (73.7%, 74.0% and 75.3% infection, respectively). The latter strain was also inhibited by 3-oxo-voacangine (82.8% infection).

Conversely, no inhibition was observed in the post-treatment approach. The last approach (combined) showed that voacangine, voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine and rupicoline inhibited over 90% of infections (3.5%, 6.9% and 3.5% infection, respectively) of both strains (DENV-2/NG and DENV-2/16681).

The increasing prevalence of DENV worldwide heightens the need for an effective vaccine and specific antivirals. Due to the dependence of DENV upon the lipid biosynthetic machinery of the host cell, lipid signaling and metabolism present unique opportunities for inhibiting viral replication. We screened a library of bioactive lipids and modulators of lipid metabolism and identified 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR) (fenretinide) as an inhibitor of DENV in cell culture. 4-HPR inhibits the steady-state accumulation of viral genomic RNA and reduces viremia when orally administered in a murine model of DENV infection. The molecular target responsible for this antiviral activity is distinct from other known inhibitors of DENV but appears to affect other members of the Flaviviridae, including the West Nile, Modoc, and hepatitis C viruses. Although long-chain ceramides have been implicated in DENV replication, we demonstrate that DENV is insensitive to the perturbation of long-chain ceramides in mammalian cell culture and that the effect of 4-HPR on dihydroceramide homeostasis is separable from its antiviral activity. Likewise, the induction of reactive oxygen species by 4-HPR is not required for the inhibition of DENV. The inhibition of DENV in vivo by 4-HPR, combined with its well-established safety and tolerability in humans, suggests that it may be repurposed as a pan-Flaviviridae antiviral agent.

We found that animals developed a neutralizing antibody response after the infective dose and were notably boosted with a second dose of the chimeric protein 3 months later. The neutralizing antibodies induced were long lasting, and animals also showed the ability to induce a specific cellular response 6 months after the booster dose. As a conclusion, we can state that the domain III region, when it is properly presented as a fusion protein to the immune system, is able to recall the neutralizing antibody response elicited following homologous virus infection in monkeys.

Secondary infections are considered a risk factor for developing SD, presumably through a mechanism called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Despite extensive studies, the molecular bases of how ADE contributes to SD and VPS are largely unknown. This work compares the cytokine responses of differentiated U937 human monocytic cells infected directly with dengue virus (DENV) or in the presence of enhancing concentrations of a humanized monoclonal antibody recognizing protein E (ADE-DENV infection). Using a cytometric bead assay, ADE-DENV-infected cells were found to produce significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-12p70, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), than cells directly infected. The capacity of conditioned supernatants (conditioned medium [CM]) to disrupt tight junctions (TJs) in MDCK cell cultures was evaluated. Exposure of MDCK cell monolayers to CM collected from ADE-DENV-infected cells (ADE-CM) but not from cells infected directly led to a rapid loss of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and to delocalization and degradation of apical-junction complex proteins. Depletion of either TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-12p70 from CM from ADE-DENV-infected cells fully reverted the disrupting effect on TJs. Remarkably, mice injected intraperitoneally with ADE-CM showed increased vascular permeability in sera and lungs, as indicated by an Evans blue quantification assay. These results indicate that the cytokine response of U937-derived macrophages to ADE-DENV infection shows an increased capacity to disturb TJs, while results obtained with the mouse model suggest that such a response may be related to the vascular plasma leakage characteristic of SD.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results indicate that the cytokine response of U937-derived macrophages to ADE-DENV infection shows an increased capacity to disturb TJs, while results obtained with the mouse model suggest that such a response may be related to the vascular plasma leakage characteristic of SD."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6059,"details":{"paperId":"a776ae83ca462ebbcac5596d3d3d4d32f1540435","externalIds":{"MAG":"2558818275","PubMedCentral":"5127493","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pmed.1002182","CorpusId":"4834842","PubMed":"27898675"},"title":"The Dengue Vaccine Dilemma: Balancing the Individual and Population Risks and Benefits","abstract":"In a Perspective, Jacqueline Deeen discusses challenges in balancing the individual and population risks and benefits for CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia), the first available dengue vaccine.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"In a Perspective, Jacqueline Deeen discusses challenges in balancing the individual and population risks and benefits for CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia), the first available dengue vaccine."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7150,"details":{"paperId":"61ecd2d1f1f9f0bc6c25e02fc3f42e4e982702e8","externalIds":{"MAG":"2806795375","PubMedCentral":"6446661","DOI":"10.2174/1389203719666180531122724","CorpusId":"46922545","PubMed":"29852867"},"title":"The Development of Peptide-based Antimicrobial Agents against Dengue Virus","abstract":"Dengue fever has become an imminent threat to international public health because of global warming and climate change.

The genomes of both, dengue and zika viruses encodes 10 genes that are translated into three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a highly conserved glycoprotein of approximately 48–50 KDa. In infected cells, NS1 is found as a homodimer associated with intracellular membranes and replication complexes, serving as a scaffolding protein in virus replication and morphogenesis. NS1 is secreted efficiently from infected cells as a hexamer and is found in patient's sera during the acute phase of the disease. NS1 detection in sera is a valuable diagnostic marker and immunization with NS1 has been shown to protect animal models from lethal challenges with dengue and Zika viruses. Nevertheless, soluble NS1 has been associated with severe dengue and anti-NS1 antibodies have been reported to cross-react with host platelets and endothelial cells and thus presumably contribute to pathogenesis.

Here we review the current state of knowledge about the human antibody response to dengue and identify important knowledge gaps. A large body of work has demonstrated that antibodies can neutralize or enhance DENV infection. Investigators have mainly used mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to study interactions between DENV and antibodies. These studies indicate that antibody neutralization of DENVs is a “multi-hit” phenomenon that requires the binding of multiple antibodies to neutralize a virion. The most potently neutralizing mouse MAbs bind to surface exposed epitopes on domain III of the dengue envelope (E) protein. One challenge facing the dengue field now is to extend these studies with mouse MAbs to better understand the human antibody response. The human antibody response is complex as it involves a polyclonal response to primary and secondary infections with 4 different DENV serotypes. Here we review studies conducted with immune sera and MAbs isolated from people exposed to dengue infections. Most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple DENV serotypes. The human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize DENV represent a small fraction of the total DENV-specific antibody response. Moreover, these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex, quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion. These studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion. The leading theory proposed to explain the increased risk of severe disease in secondary cases is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), which postulates that weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of FcγR bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Here we review results from human, animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ADE hypothesis.

A recent comprehensive analysis of the human T cell response against wild-type DENV suggested an human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-linked protective role for CD8+ T cells. We have collected one-unit blood donations from study participants receiving the monovalent or tetravalent live attenuated DENV vaccine (DLAV), developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these donors were screened in gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays with pools of predicted, HLA-matched, class I binding peptides covering the entire DENV proteome. Here, we characterize for the first time CD8+ T cell responses after live attenuated dengue vaccination and show that CD8+ T cell responses in vaccinees were readily detectable and comparable to natural dengue infection. Interestingly, whereas broad responses to structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins were observed after monovalent vaccination, T cell responses following tetravalent vaccination were, dramatically, focused toward the highly conserved NS proteins. Epitopes were highly conserved in a vast variety of field isolates and able to elicit multifunctional T cell responses. Detailed knowledge of the T cell response will contribute to the identification of robust correlates of protection in natural immunity and following vaccination against DENV. IMPORTANCE The development of effective vaccination strategies against dengue virus (DENV) infection and clinically significant disease is a task of high global public health value and significance, while also being a challenge of significant complexity. A recent efficacy trial of the most advanced dengue vaccine candidate, demonstrated only partial protection against all four DENV serotypes, despite three subsequent immunizations and detection of measurable neutralizing antibodies to each serotype in most subjects. These results challenge the hypothesis that seroconversion is the only reliable correlate of protection. Here, we show that CD8+ T cell responses in vaccinees were readily detectable and comparable to natural dengue virus infection.

Envelope protein domain III (ED3) is the major target for the binding of dengue virus neutralizing antibodies; however, the ED3-specifc T-cell response is less well understood. To investigate the T-cell responses to four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to 4), we immunized mice using either a tetravalent ED3-based DNA or protein vaccine, or combined both as a DNA prime-protein boost strategy (prime-boost). A significant serotype-dependent IFN-γ or IL-4 response was observed in mice immunized with either the DNA or protein vaccine. The IFN-γ response was dominant to DENV-1 to 3, whereas the IL-4 response was dominant to DENV-4. Although the similar IgG titers for the four serotypes were observed in mice immunized with the tetravalent vaccines, the neutralizing antibody titers varied and followed the order of 2 = 3>1>4. Interestingly, the lower IFN-γ response to DENV-4 is attributable to the immunodominance change between two CD4+ T-cell epitopes; one T-cell epitope located at E349-363 of DENV-1 to 3 was more immunogenic than the DENV-4 epitope E313-327. Despite DENV-4 specific IFN-γ responses were suppressed by immunodominance change, either DENV-4-specific IFN-γ or neutralizing antibody responses were still recalled after DENV-4 challenge and contributed to virus clearance.

Recent studies with human antibodies indicate that type-specific antibodies at high concentrations are often strongly neutralizing in vitro and protective in animal models. In general, cross-reactive antibodies are poorly neutralizing and can enhance the ability of DENV to infect Fc receptor-bearing cells under some conditions. Type-specific antibodies at low concentrations also may enhance infection. There is an urgent need to determine whether there are conserved antigenic sites that can be recognized by cross-reactive potently neutralizing antibodies. Here, we describe the isolation of a large panel of naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed to the DENV domain II fusion loop (FL) envelope protein region from subjects following vaccination or natural infection. Most of the FL-specific antibodies exhibited a conventional phenotype, characterized by low-potency neutralizing function and antibody-dependent enhancing activity. One clone, however, recognized the bc loop of domain II adjacent to the FL and exhibited a unique phenotype of ultrahigh potency, neutralizing all four serotypes better than any other previously described MAb recognizing this region. This antibody not only neutralized DENV effectively but also competed for binding against the more prevalent poor-quality antibodies whose binding was focused on the FL. The 1C19 human antibody could be a promising component of a preventative or therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the unique epitope revealed by 1C19 suggests a focus for rational vaccine design based on novel immunogens presenting cross-reactive neutralizing determinants. IMPORTANCE With no effective vaccine available, the incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infections worldwide continues to rise, with more than 390 million infections estimated to occur each year. Due to the unique roles that antibodies are postulated to play in the pathogenesis of DENV infection and disease, there is consensus that a successful DENV vaccine must protect against all four serotypes. If conserved epitopes recognized by naturally occurring potently cross-neutralizing human antibodies could be identified, monovalent subunit vaccine preparations might be developed. We characterized 30 DENV cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and identified one (1C19) that recognized a novel conserved site, known as the bc loop. This antibody has several desirable features, as it neutralizes DENV effectively and competes for binding against the more common low-potency fusion loop (FL) antibodies, which are believed to contribute to antibody-mediated disease.

Each of these Wolbachia strains interferes with viral pathogenicity and/or dissemination in both their natural Drosophila host and in their new mosquito host, and it has been suggested that this virus interference may be due to host immune priming by Wolbachia. In order to identify aspects of the mosquito immune response that might underpin virus interference, we used whole-genome microarrays to analyse the transcriptional response of A. aegypti to the wMel and wMelPop-CLA Wolbachia strains. While wMel affected the transcription of far fewer host genes than wMelPop-CLA, both strains activated the expression of some immune genes including anti-microbial peptides, Toll pathway genes and genes involved in melanization. Because the induction of these immune genes might be associated with the very recent introduction of Wolbachia into the mosquito, we also examined the same Wolbachia strains in their original host D. melanogaster. First we demonstrated that when dengue viruses were injected into D. melanogaster, virus accumulation was significantly reduced in the presence of Wolbachia, just as in A. aegypti. Second, when we carried out transcriptional analyses of the same immune genes up-regulated in the new heterologous mosquito host in response to Wolbachia we found no over-expression of these genes in D. melanogaster, infected with either wMel or wMelPop.

ABSTRACT The virus family Flaviviridae encompasses several viruses, including (re)emerging viruses which cause widespread morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Members of this virus family are positive-strand RNA viruses and replicate their genome in close association with reorganized intracellular host cell membrane compartments. This evolutionarily conserved strategy facilitates efficient viral genome replication and contributes to evasion from host cell cytosolic defense mechanisms. We have previously described the identification of a small-compound inhibitor, K22, which exerts a potent antiviral activity against a broad range of coronaviruses by targeting membrane-bound viral RNA replication. To analyze the antiviral spectrum of this inhibitor, we assessed the inhibitory potential of K22 against several members of the Flaviviridae family, including the reemerging Zika virus (ZIKV). We show that ZIKV is strongly affected by K22. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that K22 acts during a postentry phase of the ZIKV life cycle, and combination regimens of K22 together with ribavirin (RBV) or interferon alpha (IFN-α) further increased the extent of viral inhibition. Ultrastructural electron microscopy studies revealed severe alterations of ZIKV-induced intracellular replication compartments upon infection of K22-treated cells. Importantly, the antiviral activity of K22 was demonstrated against several other members of the Flaviviridae family.

Defeating Dengue Dengue virus is a major mosquito-borne viral pathogen that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Infection can be asymptomatic, cause a self-limiting fever, or result in potentially fatal hemorrhage. There are no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies for dengue, and current treatment is restricted to fluid replacement. Thus, there is an urgent need for new treatment options for this disease. Dengue virus consists of four related but distinct serotypes, and infection is thought to elicit lifelong immunity to the infecting serotype in patients who recover but only short-term immunity against the other serotypes. Immunity is mediated by serotype-specific antibodies, but little is known about their specificity or mode of action. Now, Teoh et al. characterize a neutralizing human monoclonal antibody induced by natural dengue infection. This antibody is specific for dengue virus serotype 1 and shows little or no binding or neutralizing activity for serotypes 2, 3, and 4. The authors demonstrate that the antibody binds across two adjacent viral envelope proteins and identify the amino acids that comprise the binding site. The antiviral activity of this antibody is linked principally to a blockade of virus binding to target host cells. Treatment with this antibody results in increased survival in a mouse model of dengue virus infection. This human antibody represents a new therapeutic candidate for treating dengue serotype 1 infection. These findings also provide a structural and molecular context for understanding the nature of durable, serotype-specific immunity to dengue infection and thus have implications for the design and evaluation of vaccines against dengue. Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that affects 2.5 billion people worldwide. There are four dengue serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4), and infection with one elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype but offers only transient protection against the other serotypes. Identification of the protective determinants of the human antibody response to DENV is a vital requirement for the design and evaluation of future preventative therapies and treatments. Here, we describe the isolation of a neutralizing antibody from a DENV1-infected patient. The human antibody 14c10 (HM14c10) binds specifically to DENV1. HM14c10 neutralizes the virus principally by blocking virus attachment; at higher concentrations, a post-attachment step can also be inhibited. In vivo studies show that the HM14c10 antibody has antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations. A 7 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy map of Fab fragments of HM14c10 in a complex with DENV1 shows targeting of a discontinuous epitope that spans the adjacent surface of envelope protein dimers. As found previously, a human antibody specific for the related West Nile virus binds to a similar quaternary structure, suggesting that this could be an immunodominant epitope.

Furthermore, combined immunization remarkably increased protection against a lethal dose of DENV2, when compared to each vaccine administered alone. Results also revealed that immunization with the DNA vaccine, regardless of the combination with the chimeric virus, induced a robust cell immune response, with production of IFN-γ by CD8+ T lymphocytes.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results revealed that immunization with the DNA vaccine, regardless of the combination with the chimeric virus, induced a robust cell immune response, with production of IFN-γ by CD8+ T lymphocytes."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6629,"details":{"paperId":"e780cb35bd3bee890808233e4eb1d1ae7af2e89a","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3857832","MAG":"2110760542","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003761","CorpusId":"13206865","PubMed":"24348242"},"title":"The Type-Specific Neutralizing Antibody Response Elicited by a Dengue Vaccine Candidate Is Focused on Two Amino Acids of the Envelope Protein","abstract":"Dengue viruses are mosquito-borne flaviviruses that circulate in nature as four distinct serotypes (DENV1-4). These emerging pathogens are responsible for more than 100 million human infections annually. Severe clinical manifestations of disease are predominantly associated with a secondary infection by a heterotypic DENV serotype. The increased risk of severe disease in DENV-sensitized populations significantly complicates vaccine development, as a vaccine must simultaneously confer protection against all four DENV serotypes. Eliciting a protective tetravalent neutralizing antibody response is a major goal of ongoing vaccine development efforts. However, a recent large clinical trial of a candidate live-attenuated DENV vaccine revealed low protective efficacy despite eliciting a neutralizing antibody response, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the humoral immune response against dengue infection. In this study, we sought to identify epitopes recognized by serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies elicited by monovalent DENV1 vaccination. We constructed a panel of over 50 DENV1 structural gene variants containing substitutions at surface-accessible residues of the envelope (E) protein to match the corresponding DENV2 sequence. Amino acids that contribute to recognition by serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies were identified as DENV mutants with reduced sensitivity to neutralization by DENV1 immune sera, but not cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies elicited by DENV2 vaccination. We identified two mutations (E126K and E157K) that contribute significantly to type-specific recognition by polyclonal DENV1 immune sera. Longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of sera from 24 participants of a phase I clinical study revealed a markedly reduced capacity to neutralize a E126K/E157K DENV1 variant. Sera from 77% of subjects recognized the E126K/E157K DENV1 variant and DENV2 equivalently (<3-fold difference). These data indicate the type-specific component of the DENV1 neutralizing antibody response to vaccination is strikingly focused on just two amino acids of the E protein. This study provides an important step towards deconvoluting the functional complexity of DENV serology following vaccination.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study constructed a panel of over 50 DENV1 structural gene variants containing substitutions at surface-accessible residues of the envelope (E) protein to match the corresponding DENV2 sequence and identified two mutations that contribute significantly to type-specific recognition by polyclonalDENV1 immune sera."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4087,"details":{"paperId":"4d7acfb8f5059fecd545aaf86af562ad44e659d6","externalIds":{"MAG":"1969185143","DOI":"10.1099/0022-1317-71-9-2107","CorpusId":"40589633","PubMed":"1698924"},"title":"The antigenic structure of dengue type 1 virus envelope and NS1 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli.","abstract":"The antigenic structures of the envelope protein, E, and the non-structural protein, NS1, of dengue type 1 virus (DEN1) have been studied in the form of recombinant fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli.

Principle finding Niclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response. Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression. Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection. Similar to the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication.

There are numerous questions regarding how DENV seizes cellular machinery and cholesterol to improve viral production and the effect of cholesterol sequestering agents on the cellular antiviral response. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of DENV replication induced by agents that diminish intracellular cholesterol levels. Cholesterol synthesis was pharmacologically (fluvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin treatment) and genetically (HMGCR‑RNAi) inhibited, in uninfected and DENV2‑infected hepatoma Huh‑7 cells. The cholesterol levels, DENV titer and cellular antiviral expression profile were evaluated. A reduction in the DENV titer, measured as plaque forming units, was observed in DENV‑infected cells following 48 h treatment with 10 µM fluvastatin, 10 µM atorvastatin, 20 µM lovastatin and 20 µM simvastatin, which achieved 70, 70, 65 and 55% DENV2 inhibition, respectively, compared with the untreated cells. In addition, the cytopathic effect was reduced in the statin‑treated DENV‑infected cells. Statins simultaneously reduced cholesterol levels at 48 h, with the exception of DENV2 infected cells. Genetic inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was performed using RNA interference for 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑CoA reductase (HMGCR‑siRNA), which indicated a slight reduction in DENV2 titer at 48 h post‑infection, however, with no significant reduction in cholesterol levels. In addition, DENV2 infection was observed to augment the intracellular cholesterol levels in all experimental conditions. Comparison between the cellular antiviral response triggered by DENV2 infection, statin treatment and HMGCR‑siRNA in infected, uninfected, treated and untreated Huh7 cells, showed different expression profiles for the antiviral genes evaluated.

We prepared amorphous oligomers in five distinct ways. One oligomer type was produced using our SCP tag (Solubility Controlling Peptide) made of 5 Isoleucines (C5I). The others were prepared by miss-shuffling the SS bonds (Ms), heating (Ht), stirring (St), and freeze-thaw (FT). Dynamic light scattering showed that all five formulations contained oligomers of approximately identical sizes with hydrodynamic radii (Rh) between 30 and 55 nm. Circular dichroism (cd) indicated that the secondary structure content of oligomers formed by stirring and freeze-thaw was essentially identical to that of the native monomeric D3ED3. The secondary structure content of the Ms showed moderate changes, whereas the C5I and heat-induced (Ht) oligomers exhibited a significant change. Immunization in JcL:ICR mice showed that both C5I and Ms significantly increased the anti-D3ED3 IgG titer. Ht, St, and FT were barely immunogenic, similar to the monomeric D3ED3. Cell surface CD marker analysis by flow cytometry confirmed that immunization with Ms generated a strong central and effector T-cell memory. This result adds a new dimension to earlier studies where the strength of the immune response was associated solely with the presence and sizes of the oligomers. It also suggests that controlled oligomerization can provide a new, adjuvant-free method for increasing a protein’s immunogenicity, yielding a potentially powerful platform for protein-based vaccines.

The original antigenic sin phenomenon may amplify such antibodies upon subsequent heterologous flavivirus infection, potentially aggravating disease by antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). The most striking example is provided by the four different dengue viruses, where infection by one serotype appears to predispose to more severe disease upon infection by a second one.

DENV is endemic in all tropical and subtropical areas in the world, with approximately 390 million human infections annually, of which 96 million infections manifest symptoms [1]. DENV infection could lead to dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The disease outcome is controlled by both viral and host factors. Immune response to DENV infection, such as cytokine production, could contribute to increased vascular permeability, leading to severe DHF/DSS. Currently, there is no clinically approved anti-DENV therapy or vaccine. Lifelong immunity following infection is only protective to the same serotype; a secondary infection by a different serotype may result in more severe symptoms [2]. Therefore, a successful vaccine requires a balanced immunity against all four serotypes of DENV. Such challenges of dengue vaccine underscores the urgency for antiviral development. This editorial aims to summarize the current status of dengue drug discovery, focusing on compounds that have been tested in dengue clinical trials, and highlighting the challenges for dengue drug discovery. The ideal treatment for dengue is a safe, pan-serotype active, fast-acting direct antiviral with high resistance barrier. Nucleoside and nucleotide inhibitors of polymerase fulfill these criteria. Balapiravir was the first nucleoside analog and the only direct antiviral inhibitor that has entered clinical trial in dengue patients [3]. Balapiravir is a prodrug of 4 -́azidocytidine that was initially developed for hepatitis C virus (HCV). The compound was terminated owing to toxicity after a longterm treatment required for HCV therapy [4]. Since Balapiravir is active against DENV in cell culture, it was repurposed for potential dengue therapy. Adult dengue patients within 48 h of onset of fever were given 1500 mg (n = 10) or 3000 mg (n = 22) twice daily for 5 days. Although the drug was well tolerated, viremia and fever clearance time as well as plasma cytokine profile showed no difference to that of patients receiving placebo (n = 32). Two possible reasons have been proposed for the lack of efficacy in dengue patients [5]: Balapiravir decreased its potency when treating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (one of the DENV replication sites in patients) that were preinfected with DENV; and the compound exhibited weak antiviral activities in different nonhematopoietic cells. Both reasons stem from the requirement of host kinases to convert nucleoside analog to its triphosphate form – the active ingredient for antiviral activity. Besides Balapiravir as a viral target inhibitor, a number of host inhibitors that suppress DENV replication and/or modulate host immune response have been tested in clinical trials. Chloroquine has long been used as an antimalarial drug. It is a weak base and could exert anti-DENV activity by interfering with the acidic pH of endolysosomal compartments and the trans-Golgi network in which the virus undergoes fusion and maturation. Chloroquine was dosed according to the WHO recommended treatment regimen in 153 dengue patients.

There are an estimated 390 million annual dengue virus infections globally, of which about one quarter become symptomatic or severe [1]. The risk of developing severe disease has historically been greater in children aged ≤15 years [2,3]. A gradual upward age shift in the burden of severe dengue has occurred in the last decades in Asia towards those aged ≥15 years [3]. Conservative estimates from a societal perspective suggest an economic burden of US$ 2.1 billion (2010 US$) annually in the Americas [4] and US$ 950 million (2010 US$) annually in 12 countries in Southeast Asia [5]. Rapid urbanization leading to overcrowding with inadequate water supply and sanitation has created ideal environments for A. aegypti mosquitoes, leading to resurgence of dengue epidemics in many tropical and subtropical countries [6]. There are many challenges for dengue vaccine development, for example, lack of animal model and no known correlates of protection and concern around immune enhancement. The first licensed vaccine is the one developed by Sanofi Pasteur; several others are in development.","publicationTypes":["Editorial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The first d Dengue vaccine, a recombinant yellow fever-17D–dengue virus, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV; Dengvaxia, Sanofi Pasteur, Singapore, Singapore), has recently been licensed for use in individuals aged from 9 to 45 years in Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, El Salvador, and Paraguay."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4034,"details":{"paperId":"2a5454a30a354bd1bdec4e2b1b1f0216974cd562","externalIds":{"MAG":"2960278496","DOI":"10.1097/QCO.0000000000000573","CorpusId":"196617193","PubMed":"31305495"},"title":"The first licensed dengue vaccine: can it be used in travelers?","abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nThe first dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) was endorsed by the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration. Given the excess risk of severe dengue in seronegative vaccinees, use is restricted to seropositive individuals. Dengvaxia confers high protection against severe dengue in seropositive vaccinees.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nWith increasing global travel, the probability of travelers being seropositive increases. Such seropositive travelers may be at increased risk of severe dengue as a result of a second dengue infection during repeat travel. Nevertheless, the use of Dengvaxia in travelers requires a careful analysis of all the factors. Seropositive travelers only present a minority of all travelers. A validated rapid diagnostic test to screen for dengue serostatus is not yet available. Such a test should be highly specific to avoid inadvertent vaccination of seronegative individuals. The three-dose regimen precludes the use in most travelers who tend to present at travel clinics less than 6 weeks prior to departure. Furthermore, questions about potential sub-optimal immunogenicity in seropositives in nonendemic settings, and the need and timing of boosters remain unanswered.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough there could potentially be substantial protection against severe dengue in seropositive travelers, Dengvaxia is far from an ideal travel vaccine.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Although there could potentially be substantial protection against severe dengue in seropositive travelers, Dengvaxia is far from an ideal travel vaccine."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1136,"details":{"paperId":"e281a47cc8b38ca324de88cf78831b160852c87b","externalIds":{"MAG":"2083791825","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.03.014","CorpusId":"205576273","PubMed":"25842996"},"title":"The flavivirus NS2B-NS3 protease-helicase as a target for antiviral drug development.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0"}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1076,"details":{"paperId":"af68599618b343bbbd1645637f74a62bac12f7f1","externalIds":{"MAG":"2054056331","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.06.007","CorpusId":"32017950","PubMed":"18611413"},"title":"The flavivirus polymerase as a target for drug discovery.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An overview of the current knowledge regarding Flavivirus RdRp function and structure is given as it represents an attractive target for drug design and ongoing approaches of in vitro and cell-based screening programs aiming at the discovery of nucleosidic and non-nucleosidics inhibitors targeting Flaviv virus RdRps are reviewed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":760,"details":{"paperId":"288a2aacbdc627aebb3d93350538b9119476e56f","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1007/s12250-013-3390-x","CorpusId":"255559496"},"title":"The flavivirus protease as a target for drug discovery","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A review of recent drug development studies targeting the NS3 active site, as well as studies targeting an NS2B/NS3 interaction site determined from flavivirus protease crystal structures, finds that both are attractive targets for antiviral drug development."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4049,"details":{"paperId":"3d8736e6cf603e09b687143d69f8209bfbea6135","externalIds":{"MAG":"2139450691","DOI":"10.1099/0022-1317-23-1-91","CorpusId":"46472429","PubMed":"4833603"},"title":"The flaviviruses (group B arboviruses): a cross-neutralization study.","abstract":"Summary Cross-neutralization studies on 42 flaviviruses and their respective antisera were performed by a plaque assay in a line of pig kidney cells.

The global distribution of four dengue serotypes has also added economic burden in the dengue-endemic countries. To discover the potent dengue virus inhibitors in the antler form of Ganoderma lucidum (Lingzhi or Reishi), the water extraction of normal G. lucidum and its antler form were conducted and the chemical compounds were identified by LC-MS. Six distinct chemical compounds identified in high abundance were hesperetin, thymidine, lucidenic acid, 11-aminoundecanoic acid, 5-carboxyvanillic acid and ganocin B. The water extracts of G. lucidum in its antler form inhibited the DENV2 NS2B-NS3 protease activity at 84.6 ± 0.7%, higher than the normal G. lucidum. Then, molecular docking was performed on the homology model built from an in-house sequence. Docking simulation results showed that hesperetin and ganocin B were the best leads to bind at the catalytic triad of DENV2 NS2B-NS3pro via hydrogen bonding, van der Waals and pi-pi interactions. Extensive overlapping of HOMO-LUMO orbitals at the ringed regions of hesperetin helped to facilitate the entry of ligand to the catalytic triad cleft.

Dengue model rises to the challenge Human efficacy testing remains a major hurdle in bringing new vaccine candidates to the clinic. In the absence of accepted correlates of protection, rounds of safety trials must be performed before efficacy can be tested in a large population in an endemic area. Kirkpatrick et al. have developed a controlled dengue human challenge model to assess the protective efficacy of the most clinically advanced dengue vaccine candidate. They found that TV003, a live attenuated dengue vaccine that induces antibodies to all four dengue virus serotypes, protected against infection of an attenuated virus in 21 recipients when compared with 20 nonvaccinated controls. This model may serve as an early check for dengue vaccine candidates, limiting the risk of conducting large unsuccessful trials. A dengue human challenge model can be an important tool to identify candidate dengue vaccines that should be further evaluated in large efficacy trials in endemic areas. Dengue is responsible for about 390 million infections annually. Protective efficacy results for the most advanced dengue vaccine candidate (CYD) were disappointing despite its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies against all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. TV003 is a live attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccine currently in phase 2 evaluation. To better assess the protective efficacy of TV003, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which recipients of TV003 or placebo were challenged 6 months later with a DENV-2 strain, rDEN2Δ30, was conducted. The primary endpoint of the trial was protection against dengue infection, defined as rDEN2Δ30 viremia. Secondary endpoints were protection against rash and neutropenia. All 21 recipients of TV003 who were challenged with rDEN2Δ30 were protected from infection with rDEN2Δ30. None developed viremia, rash, or neutropenia after challenge. In contrast, 100% of the 20 placebo recipients who were challenged with rDEN2Δ30 developed viremia, 80% developed rash, and 20% developed neutropenia. TV003 induced complete protection against challenge with rDEN2Δ30 administered 6 months after vaccination. TV003 will be further evaluated in dengue-endemic areas.

The VBFVs include those transmitted by mosquitos, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus; and those transmitted by ticks including the tick-borne flavivirus serocomplex and Powassan virus (POWV). Two of our recent reports showed that intracranial POWV infection in the reservoir host, Peromyscus leucopus, was restricted and caused no overt clinical disease. Several modes of analyses suggested activation of the LXR pathway. Activation of the LXR pathway leads to increased efflux of cholesterol from cells and consequent disturbances in membrane biogenesis. Because VBFV replication is dependent on membrane biogenesis, we evaluated the effect of an LXR agonist (LXR623) on POWV and ZIKV infection and observed that the compound impaired permissive replication of both viruses in a human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. The LXR agonist resulted in failure of the viruses to induce ER expansion and elaborate vesicle formation, suggesting that the efflux of cholesterol was part of the antiviral mechanism. We also observed that the LXR agonist contributed to the mechanism of virus suppression by increased expression of mRNAs encoding for the antiviral cytokines CXCL10, RANTES and IFN1β. In sharp contrast, a LXR antagonist (GSK2033) had no significant effect on VBFV replication.

However, major complications of a ZIKV infection have recently become apparent for reasons that are still not fully elucidated. One of the hypotheses for the seemingly increased pathogenicity of ZIKV is that cross-reactive dengue antibodies can enhance a ZIKV infection through the principle of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Recently, ADE in ZIKV infection has been studied, but conclusive evidence for the clinical importance of this principle in a ZIKV infection is lacking. Conversely, the widespread circulation of ZIKV in dengue virus (DENV)-endemic regions raises new questions about the potential contribution of ZIKV antibodies to DENV ADE. In this review, we summarize the results of the evidence to date and elaborate on other possible detrimental effects of cross-reactive flavivirus antibodies, both for ZIKV infection and the risk of ZIKV-related congenital anomalies, DENV infection, and dengue hemorrhagic fever.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The widespread circulation of ZikV in dengue virus (DENV)-endemic regions raises new questions about the potential contribution of ZIKV antibodies to DENV ADE, and possible detrimental effects of cross-reactive flavivirus antibodies are detailed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2315,"details":{"paperId":"f712019702aef721d0800d65a4bab24245206c34","externalIds":{"MAG":"2996240102","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.012","CorpusId":"209490673","PubMed":"31879126"},"title":"The potential impact of dengue vaccination with, and without, pre-vaccination screening.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The recommended option of a screen and vaccinate policy is likely to have a positive impact both at the individual and population level across a wide range of transmission settings and has the potential to be as, if not more, cost-effective than a no screening strategy."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2994,"details":{"paperId":"cf6faf942b8cf831a792d0f4971958e0d3df93c1","externalIds":{"MAG":"1967319325","DOI":"10.1038/icb.2014.63","CorpusId":"27269591","PubMed":"25178969"},"title":"The protein DIIIC‐2, aggregated with a specific oligodeoxynucleotide and adjuvanted in alum, protects mice and monkeys against DENV‐2","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This is the first work describing the induction of short‐term protection in monkeys by a formulation that is suitable for human use combining a recombinant protein from DENV with alum."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1536,"details":{"paperId":"952a08fa6706f0a92f250b28de2369df51e33a7f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2523690888","DOI":"10.1016/j.coviro.2016.09.003","CorpusId":"3438671","PubMed":"27648486"},"title":"The quest for host targets to combat dengue virus infections.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":null},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":203,"details":{"paperId":"cb4f01e6af099c068a772bcdb9ef39bcb9cd9000","externalIds":{"MAG":"3008251007","DOI":"10.1002/rmv.2100","CorpusId":"211535945","PubMed":"32101633"},"title":"The role of anti‐flavivirus humoral immune response in protection and pathogenesis","abstract":"Flavivirus infections are a public health threat in the world that requires the development of safe and effective vaccines.

In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a dengue vaccine made from a recombinant measles virus (MV) that expresses envelope protein domain III (ED3) of dengue-1 to 4. Following immunization with the MV-vectored dengue vaccine, mice developed specific interferon-gamma and antibody responses against dengue virus and MV. Neutralizing antibodies against MV and dengue viruses were also induced, and protective levels of FRNT50 ≥ 10 to 4 serotypes of dengue viruses were detected in the MV-vectored dengue vaccine-immunized mice. In addition, specific interferon-gamma and antibody responses to dengue viruses were still induced by the MV-vectored dengue vaccine in mice that were pre-infected with MV. This finding suggests that the pre-existing immunity to MV did not block the initiation of immune responses. By contrast, mice that were pre-infected with dengue-3 exhibited no effect in terms of their antibody responses to MV and dengue viruses, but a dominant dengue-3-specific T-cell response was observed. After injection with dengue-2, a detectable but significantly lower viremia and a higher titer of anti-dengue-2 neutralizing antibodies were observed in MV-vectored dengue vaccine-immunized mice versus the vector control, suggesting that an anamnestic antibody response that provided partial protection against dengue-2 was elicited.

The rise of recombinant DNA technology and its application to study flavivirus genome structure and expression has opened new possibilities for flavivirus vaccine development. One new approach is the use of cDNAs encopassing the whole viral genome to generate infectious RNA after in vitro transcription. This methodology allows the genetic mapping of specific viral functions and the design of viral mutants with considerable potential as new live attenuated viruses. The use of infectious cDNA as a carrier for heterologous antigens is gaining importance as chimeric viruses are shown to be viable, immunogenic and less virulent as compared to the parental viruses. The use of DNA to overcome mutation rates intrinsic of RNA virus populations in conjunction with vaccine production in cell culture should improve the reliability and lower the cost for production of live attenuated vaccines.

To circumvent these potentially harmful events, we replaced the C-terminal region of DENV NS1 with the corresponding region from Japanese encephalitis virus NS1 to create chimeric DJ NS1 protein. Passive immunization of DENV-infected mice with polyclonal anti–DJ NS1 Abs reduced viral Ag expression at skin inoculation sites and shortened DENV-induced prolonged bleeding time. We also investigated the therapeutic effects of anti-NS1 mAb. One mAb designated 2E8 does not recognize the C-terminal region of DENV NS1 in which host–cross-reactive epitopes reside. Moreover, mAb 2E8 recognizes NS1 of all four DENV serotypes. We also found that mAb 2E8 caused complement-mediated lysis in DENV-infected cells. In mouse model studies, treatment with mAb 2E8 shortened DENV-induced prolonged bleeding time and reduced viral Ag expression in the skin. Importantly, mAb 2E8 provided therapeutic effects against all four serotypes of DENV. We further found that mAb administration to mice as late as 1 d prior to severe bleeding still reduced prolonged bleeding time and hemorrhage.

Furthermore, all four DENV serotypes cocirculate and create a problematic hyperendemic situation. Characteristic symptoms range from being asymptomatic, dengue fever to life-threatening complications such as hemorrhagic fever and shock. Apart from the inherent virulence of the virus strain, a dysregulated host immune response makes the condition worse. Currently, there is no highly recommended vaccine or therapeutic agent against dengue. With the advent of virus strains resistant to antiviral agents, there is a constant need for new therapies to be developed. Since time immemorial, human civilization has utilized plants in traditional medicine to treat various diseases, including infectious viral diseases.

There is no specific treatment or vaccine approved for human use. This fact, associated with the large number of infected individuals and the lack of markers that indicate which patients will develop severe disease, place an enormous burden on health systems of affected countries. Many efforts have been made to elucidate several aspects of dengue disease, but the pathogenesis of disease is complex and remains unclear. The hallmark of severe dengue disease is a short‐lived plasma leakage that is believed to be immune mediated. Understanding the mechanism(s) that underlie the pathogenesis of dengue is critical for the development of safe therapeutics to prevent DHF/DSS. In this review, we highlight potential therapeutic alternatives to treat dengue infection and outline strategies used to develop and research anti‐dengue therapies, focusing on in vivo results obtained using the experimental animal models currently available. Within this context, we discuss the therapeutic potential of novel antiviral molecules, either targeting virus‐encoded functions or the cellular functions needed for viral replication. In addition, we discuss studies using anti‐inflammatory strategies aimed at reducing the exacerbated host response against infection and their potential as promising therapeutic alternatives in severe dengue disease.

However, the fundamental properties that characterize epitope residues and how mutations affect antibody binding to alter virus susceptibility to neutralization remain largely unknown. To address these questions, we used an ensemble-based algorithm to characterize the effects of mutations on the thermodynamics of protein conformational fluctuations. We applied this method to the envelope protein domain III (ED3) of two medically important flaviviruses: West Nile and dengue 2. We determined an intimate relationship between the susceptibility of a residue to thermodynamic perturbations and epitope location. This relationship allows the successful identification of the primary epitopes in each ED3, despite their high sequence and structural similarity. Mutations that allow the ED3 to evade detection by the antibody either increase or decrease conformational fluctuations of the epitopes through local effects or long-range interactions. Spatially distant interactions originate in the redistribution of conformations of the ED3 ensembles, not through a mechanically connected array of contiguous amino acids. These results reconcile previous observations of evasion of neutralization by mutations at a distance from the epitopes. Finally, we established a quantitative correlation between subtle changes in the conformational fluctuations of the epitope and large defects in antibody binding affinity. This correlation suggests that mutations that allow viral growth, while reducing neutralization, do not generate significant structural changes and underscores the importance of protein fluctuations and long-range interactions in the mechanism of antibody-mediated neutralization resistance.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A quantitative correlation between subtle changes in the conformational fluctuations of the epitope and large defects in antibody binding affinity suggests that mutations that allow viral growth, while reducing neutralization, do not generate significant structural changes and underscores the importance of protein fluctuations and long-range interactions in the mechanism of antibody-mediated neutralization resistance."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2943,"details":{"paperId":"8f47fa2bad52e873177b14e4f351340fc1cceabf","externalIds":{"MAG":"2315469262","DOI":"10.1021/jm400828u","CorpusId":"33501270","PubMed":"24083834"},"title":"Thiazolidinone-peptide hybrids as dengue virus protease inhibitors with antiviral activity in cell culture.","abstract":"The protease of dengue virus is a promising target for antiviral drug discovery.

Thrombocytopenia is frequently observed in mild and severe cases of dengue. Severe thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count much below the normal range and hemorrhagic manifestation, is considered a fatal consequence of dengue that needs proper and timely management. The development of the dengue vaccine is quite challenging due to the existence of four different serotypes of the virus. Currently, neither a specific antiviral therapy nor a vaccine is available, and the common treatment modalities include fluid replacement therapy and platelet transfusions. Besides dengue, thrombocytopenia is correlated with many other diseases, particularly immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonist, which is responsible for increasing platelet count, is a novel treatment option for chronic ITP patients. At present, two TPO-R agonists - eltrombopag and romiplostim - approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) have been successfully used for the treatment of chronic ITP and other thrombocytopenic conditions. However, to date, only a single case study reported the use of romiplostim to enhance the platelet count in a myeloma patient suffering from dengue-associated thrombocytopenia. The objective of this review is to propose to the medical fraternity to consider using these TPO-R agonists to treat dengue hemorrhagic patients with thrombocytopenia and to conduct relevant researches to find out the usefulness of these molecules. This review is completely based on hypotheses and articles showing the positive response with romiplostim in dengue after going through a web-based search on various search engines. Furthermore, this review highlights the need for good-quality, randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to detect the safety and efficacy of romiplostim and eltrombopag therapy for patients suffering from dengue-related thrombocytopenia.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The objective of this review is to propose to the medical fraternity to consider using these TPO-R agonists to treat dengue hemorrhagic patients with thrombocytopenia and to conduct relevant researches to find out the usefulness of these molecules."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":5245,"details":{"paperId":"cd1be44fea00b5ff8cb653725673dc8377e3460d","externalIds":{"MAG":"2145773661","DOI":"10.1128/JVI.75.17.8259-8267.2001","CorpusId":"11967783","PubMed":"11483771"},"title":"Tick-Borne Langat/Mosquito-Borne Dengue Flavivirus Chimera, a Candidate Live Attenuated Vaccine for Protection against Disease Caused by Members of the Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus Complex: Evaluation in Rhesus Monkeys and in Mosquitoes","abstract":"ABSTRACT Langat virus (LGT), strain TP21, a naturally avirulent tick-borne flavivirus, was used to construct a chimeric candidate virus vaccine which contained LGT genes for premembrane (preM) and envelope (E) glycoprotein and all other sequences derived from dengue type 4 virus (DEN4). The live virus vaccine was developed to provide resistance to the highly virulent, closely related tick-borne flaviviruses that share protective E epitopes among themselves and with LGT. Toward that end the chimera, initially recovered in mosquito cells, was adapted to grow to high titer in qualified simian Vero cells. When inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.), the Vero cell-adapted LGT TP21/DEN4 chimera remained completely attenuated for SCID mice. Significantly, the chimera protected immunocompetent mice against the most virulent tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Subsequently, rhesus monkeys were immunized in groups of 4 with 105 or 107 PFU of LGT strain TP21, with 105 PFU of DEN4, or with 103, 105, or 107 PFU of the chimera. Each of the monkeys inoculated with DEN4 or LGT TP21 became viremic, and the duration of viremia ranged from 1 to 5 days. In contrast, viremia was detected in only 1 of 12 monkeys inoculated with the LGT TP21/DEN4 chimera; in this instance the level of viremia was at the limit of detection. All monkeys immunized with the chimera or LGT TP21 virus developed a moderate to high level of neutralizing antibodies against LGT TP21 as well as TBEV and were completely protected against subsequent LGT TP21 challenge, whereas monkeys previously immunized with DEN4 virus became viremic when challenged with LGT TP21. These observations suggest that the chimera is attenuated, immunogenic, and able to induce a protective immune response. Furthermore, passive transfer of serum from monkeys immunized with chimera conferred significant protection to mice subsequently challenged with 100 i.p. 50% lethal doses of the highly virulent TBEV. The issue of transmissibility of the chimera by mosquitoes was addressed by inoculating a nonhematophagous mosquito,Toxorhynchites splendens, intrathoracically with the chimera or its DEN4 or LGT parent. Neither the LGT TP21/DEN4 vaccine candidate nor the wild-type LGT TP21 virus was able to infect this mosquito species, which is highly permissive for dengue viruses. Certain properties of the chimera, notably its attenuation for monkeys, its immunogenicity, and its failure to infect a highly permissive mosquito host, make it a promising vaccine candidate for use in immunization against severe disease caused by many tick-borne flaviviruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Certain properties of the chimera, notably its attenuation for monkeys, its immunogenicity, and its failure to infect a highly permissive mosquito host, make it a promising vaccine candidate for use in immunization against severe disease caused by many tick-borne flaviviruses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":949,"details":{"paperId":"cabedfb9a2cfc0bb9dbb73a6dd3c852f94a04bb8","externalIds":{"MAG":"1990621396","DOI":"10.1016/0168-1702(94)90007-8","CorpusId":"4184982","PubMed":"7513932"},"title":"Tick-borne flavivirus NS1 gene: identification of conserved peptides and antigenic analysis of recombinant louping ill virus NS1 protein.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A dendrogram, derived from the alignment of the NS1 protein sequences, indicated an evolutionary relationship that quite closely reflects the recognised serological classification."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":3081,"details":{"paperId":"ef6deb1dfbc8862a56e935c6bd4c24c9578453d3","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"6754404","MAG":"2974163978","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-12295-2","CorpusId":"202688461","PubMed":"31541110"},"title":"Time elapsed between Zika and dengue virus infections affects antibody and T cell responses","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The authors show that the time elapsed between Zika infection and subsequent dengue virus infection affects the magnitude and durability of the antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against d Dengue virus, but not viremia, which has implications for co-endemic regions and vaccination."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":4406,"details":{"paperId":"0ddca40dc1e716d66d0688f58e9e9b7441f2641f","externalIds":{"MAG":"2970586993","DOI":"10.1101/621094","CorpusId":"202846913"},"title":"Time elapsed between Zika and dengue virus type 2 infections alters the magnitude of antibody and T cell responses but not viremia in rhesus macaques","abstract":"Abstract The role of a previous Zika virus (ZIKV) immunity on subsequent dengue virus (DENV) infections is poorly understood. This is relevant to anticipate the dynamics of forthcoming DENV epidemics in areas with previous ZIKV exposure. It is still uncertain if the immunity conferred by the recent ZIKV epidemic may contribute to protection or worsening DENV cases severity. Accordingly, we have studied the effect of ZIKV infection with various strains on subsequent DENV immune response after 10 and 2 months of ZIKV infection. Our results in non-human primates showed that a subsequent DENV infection in animals with early- and middle-convalescent periods to ZIKV do not promote an increase in DENV viremia nor pro-inflammatory status. We found that previous ZIKV exposure increases the magnitude of the antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against DENV and that the different time intervals between infections alter the magnitude and durability of such responses—more after longer ZIKV pre-exposure. Furthermore, our data suggest that the elicited immune modulation between both ZIKV-immune groups after DENV infection are more influenced by the time elapsed between ZIKV and DENV infections and the maturation of the cross-reactive immune memory, rather than a possible effect due to ZIKV strain variation. Collectively, we found no evidence of a detrimental effect of ZIKV immunity in a subsequent DENV infection regardless the period of time between infections tested on this work. This supports the implementation of ZIKV vaccines that could also boost immunity against future DENV epidemics.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is found that previous ZIKV exposure increases the magnitude of the antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against DENV and that the different time intervals between infections alter the magnitude and durability of such responses—more after longer ZikV pre-exposure."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2868,"details":{"paperId":"5c39b53095fbdc0bc892a05bc3d6cacc06f69d9f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"5824344","MAG":"2770485312","DOI":"10.1021/acschembio.7b00870","CorpusId":"3563207","PubMed":"29161006"},"title":"ToP-DNJ, a Selective Inhibitor of Endoplasmic Reticulum α-Glucosidase II Exhibiting Antiflaviviral Activity","abstract":"Iminosugars have therapeutic potential against a range of diseases, due to their efficacy as glycosidase inhibitors.

Here, we first identified that 9 A. aegypti mosGCTL genes were key susceptibility factors facilitating DENV-2 infection, of which mosGCTL-3 exhibited the most significant effect.

The vectorial susceptibility factors that facilitate pathogen invasion may potentially be explored as a target to disrupt the acquisition of microbes from the vertebrate host. Indeed, membrane blood feeding of antisera against mosGCTLs dramatically reduced mosquito infective ratio.

The vaccine, developed by Sanofi Pasteur, proved safe, had an overall efficacy rate of 56.5%, and reduced cases of severe disease by 88.5%. But it had limited efficacy against dengue 2, one of four dengue virus serotypes in circulation. First infections are typically mild; but for poorly understood reasons, infection with a second serotype can lead to severe disease. Dengue is only occasionally fatal, but the World Health Organization estimates that severe dengue sends 500,000 people to hospitals each year, straining health care systems. In considering the vaccine for national immunization programs, public health officials will have to carefully weigh the benefits of reducing that burden against the yet-to-be-determined cost of the vaccine and its limited efficacy against dengue 2.

Worldwide, approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-infested regions with about 100 million new cases each year, although many of these infections are believed to be silent. There are four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus; thus, immunity from one serotype will not cross-protect from infection with the other three. The difficulties that hamper vaccine development include requirements of the natural conformation of the envelope glycoprotein to induce neutralizing immune responses and the necessity of presenting antigens of all four serotypes. Currently, the only way to meet these requirements is to use a mixture of four serotypes of live attenuated dengue viruses, but safety remains a major problem. In this study, we have developed the basis for a tetravalent dengue vaccine using a novel complex adenovirus platform that is capable of expressing multiple antigens de novo. This dengue vaccine is constructed as a pair of vectors that each expresses the premembrane and envelope genes of two different dengue virus serotypes. Upon vaccination, the vaccine expressed high levels of the dengue virus antigens in cells to mimic a natural infection and induced both humoral and cellular immune responses against multiple serotypes of dengue virus in an animal model. Further analyses show the humoral responses were indeed neutralizing against all four serotypes.

However, secondary infection with a different serotype can result in more severe disease for a minority of patients. Host responses to the first DENV infection involve the development of both cross-reactive antibody and T cell responses, which, depending upon their precise balance, may mediate protection or enhance disease upon secondary infection with a different serotype. Abundant evidence now exists that responses elicited by DENV infection can cross-react with other members of the genus Flavivirus, particularly Zika virus (ZIKV).

Cross-reactive antibody responses may enhance infection with flaviviruses, which likely accounts for the cases of severe disease seen during secondary DENV infections. Data for T cell responses are contradictory, and even though cross-reactive T cell responses exist, their clinical significance is uncertain. Recent mouse experiments, however, show that cross-reactive T cells are capable of mediating protection against ZIKV.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an important drug target, synthesizes viral RNA and is essential for viral replication. While a number of allosteric inhibitors have been reported for hepatitis C virus RdRp, few have been described for DENV RdRp. Following a diverse compound screening campaign and a rigorous hit-to-lead flowchart combining biochemical and biophysical approaches, two DENV RdRp nonnucleoside inhibitors were identified and characterized. These inhibitors show low- to high-micromolar inhibition in DENV RNA polymerization and cell-based assays. X-ray crystallography reveals that they bind in the enzyme RNA template tunnel. One compound (NITD-434) induced an allosteric pocket at the junction of the fingers and palm subdomains by displacing residue V603 in motif B. Binding of another compound (NITD-640) ordered the fingers loop preceding the F motif, close to the RNA template entrance. Most of the amino acid residues that interacted with these compounds are highly conserved in flaviviruses. Both sites are important for polymerase de novo initiation and elongation activities and essential for viral replication. This work provides evidence that the RNA tunnel in DENV RdRp offers interesting target sites for inhibition.

Based on X-ray crystallography and sequence analysis, an analogous type-specific neutralizing epitope for individual serotypes of the related flavivirus dengue virus (DENV) was hypothesized. Using yeast surface display of DIII variants, we defined contact residues of a panel of type-specific, subcomplex-specific, and cross-reactive MAbs that recognize DIII of DENV type 2 (DENV-2) and have different neutralizing potentials. Type-specific MAbs with neutralizing activity against DENV-2 localized to a sequence-unique epitope on the lateral ridge of DIII, centered at the FG loop near residues E383 and P384, analogous in position to that observed with WNV-specific strongly neutralizing MAbs. Subcomplex-specific MAbs that bound some but not all DENV serotypes and neutralized DENV-2 infection recognized an adjacent epitope centered on the connecting A strand of DIII at residues K305, K307, and K310. In contrast, several MAbs that had poor neutralizing activity against DENV-2 and cross-reacted with all DENV serotypes and other flaviviruses recognized an epitope with residues in the AB loop of DIII, a conserved region that is predicted to have limited accessibility on the mature virion.

Attempts to create conventional vaccines have been hampered by the lack of suitable experimental models, the need to provide protection against all four serotypes simultaneously and the possible involvement of virus-specific immune responses in severe disease. The current understanding of dengue pathogenesis is outlined in this review, with special emphasis on the role of the immune response. The suspected involvement of the immune system in increased disease severity and vascular damage has raised concerns about every vaccine design strategy proposed so far. Clearly more research is needed on understanding the correlates of protection and mechanisms of pathogenesis. There is, however, an urgent need to provide a solution to the escalating global public health problems caused by dengue infections. Better disease management, vector control and improved public health measures will help reduce the current disease burden, but a safe and effective vaccine is probably the only long-term solution. Although concerns have been raised about the possible safety and efficacy of both conventional and novel vaccine technologies, the situation is now so acute that it is not possible to wait for the perfect vaccine.

The strong association of severe dengue illness, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), with heterologous secondary infection and high cytokine levels has led to a prevailing view that DHF is immunologically mediated. In vitro studies of DENV‐specific T lymphocytes, clinical studies of acute DENV infection, and immunologic studies in mouse models have provided evidence that in heterologous secondary DENV infection, there is preferential activation of memory T lymphocytes with lower avidity for the infecting virus (‘original antigenic sin’) resulting in altered T‐cell functional responses. In the setting of host genetic predisposition and high level viremia, with resulting high antigenic burden, we postulate that a skewed T‐cell cytokine response leads to plasma leakage in DHF.

THP-1 cells in the presence of subneutralizing concentration of humanized antibody 4G2 (cross-reactive with flavivirus envelope protein) or HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) were infected with DENV-1-4 serotypes. UPR gene expression was monitored under these infection conditions using real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and Western blots to analyse serotype-dependent variations. Subsequently, in a blinded study, strain-specific differences were compared between DENV-2 clinical isolates obtained from a single epidemic. Results showed that THP-1 cells were infected efficiently and equally by DENV-1-4 in the ADE mode. At 48 hpi (h post infection), DENV-1 and -3 showed a higher replication rate and induced higher expression of several UPR genes such as BiP (immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein), GADD34 (growth arrest DNA damage-inducible protein 34) and CHOP [C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein)-homologous protein].

Dengue virus-induced diseases can range from mild to severe with death. ABSTRACT Any potential dengue virus (DENV) vaccine needs to elicit protective immunity against strains from all four serotypes to avoid potential antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In this study, four independent DENV envelope (E) glycoproteins were generated using wild-type E sequences from viruses isolated between 1943 and 2006 using computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology. COBRA and wild-type E antigens were expressed on the surface of subvirion viral particles (SVPs). Four separate wild-type E antigens were used for each serotype. Mice vaccinated with wild-type DENV SVPs had anti-E IgG antibodies that neutralized serotype-specific viruses. COBRA DENV SVPs elicited a broader breadth of antibodies that neutralized strains across all four serotypes. Two COBRA DENV vaccine candidates that elicited the broadest breadth of neutralizing antibodies in mice were used to vaccinate rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that either were immunologically naive to any DENV serotype or had preexisting antibodies to DENV. Antibodies elicited by COBRA DENV E immunogens neutralized all 12 strains of DENV in vitro, which was comparable to antibodies elicited by a tetravalent wild-type E SVP vaccination mixture. Therefore, using a single DENV COBRA E protein can elicit neutralizing antibodies against strains representing all four serotypes of DENV in both naive and dengue virus-preimmune populations. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus infects millions of people living in tropical areas of the world. Dengue virus-induced diseases can range from mild to severe with death. An effective vaccine will need to neutralize viruses from all four serotypes of dengue virus without inducing enhanced disease. A dengue virus E vaccine candidate generated by computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen algorithms elicits broadly neutralizing protection for currently circulating strains from all four serotypes regardless of immune status.

Treatment of dengue is mainly based on the fluid replacement therapy.[1] For prevention, the mosquito control is the key. The search for dengue vaccine is underway.[2] Of the several new drugs being researched for dengue treatment, the natural product research is a widely studied field.[1] Indeed, there are many reports on natural products that have potential for treatment of dengue. However, only a few natural products are further evaluated in clinical pharmacology studies. The study on the potential use of neem (Azadirachta indica Juss) leaves for destroying dengue virus was published by Parida et al.[3] In this report, in vitro study showed that aqueous extract of neem could inhibit dengue virus; however the in vivo study in mice model revealed no inhibitory activity.[3] Another interesting report is published by Reis et al. In this report, immunomodulating and antiviral activities of Uncaria tomentosa on human monocytes infected with Dengue was presented.[4] In this work, alkaloidal fraction in Uncaria tomentosa was effective in reducing monocyte infection rates and cytokine levels.[4] There are also some interesting publications on novel antidengue therapeutic agents. In the study by Lee et al, antiviral effects of three novel anti-dengue therapeutic agents, sulfated polysaccharides, suramin, pentosan polysulfate (PPS) and PI88, were tested and it was shown that PI-88 was the only effect novel agent.[5] Indeed, there are also other reports on other novel agents. For example, Prestwood et al. reported on the efficacy of c-Src protein kinase inhibitors in blocking assembly and maturation of dengue virus.[6] Shigeta et al. also reported the good effectiveness of polyoxometalates in viral inhibition in mice model.[7] On the other hand, Tassniyom et al. reported the unsuccessful usage of carbazochrome sodium sulfonate or AC-17 to prevent vascular permeability or shock caused by dengue virus.[8] Focusing on the modern RNA technology, the use of mismatched double-stranded RNA was also trailed and reported for its good effectiveness as novel alternative antidengue therapeutic agent.[9] There are many dengue vaccines which are presently on trials. Vaughn et al. firstly reported on testing of a dengue two live-attenuated vaccine, strain 16681 PDK 53. in volunteers and presented for high immunogenicitiy but some minor adverse effects such as fever, headache and myalgia.[10] Kanesathasan et al. reported another study of attenuated dengue virus vaccines developed by Aventis Pasteur that this vaccine alternative was safe and demonstrated immunogenicity.[11] Many similar studies using animal models, a useful tool for research on dengue virus have been conducted.[12] However, there is no large study that confirms and leads to paradigm shift in treatment and prevention of dengue.

The treatment of DF remains supportive as there is no anti-viral agent or vaccine available as yet. Traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) provides an alternative option for the treatment of DF but there is limited evidence with regard to its usage. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, types and predictor factors of T&CM usage among DF patients in the northeast region of Peninsular Malaysia. Methodology This was a cross-sectional study of DF patients in the northeast region of Peninsular Malaysia who had been admitted to a tertiary centre from January 2014 until December 2015. Serologically-confirmed DF patients aged 18 years and above were randomly selected. Phone interviews were conducted to obtain information regarding the use of T&CM during hospitalisation. Notes were made regarding the prevalence and type of T&CM used. Binary logistic regressions were used to identify the predictor factors of T&CM usage. Results A total of 241 DF patients with a mean age of 36.62 (SD = 14.62) years were included. The estimated prevalence of T&CM usage was 84.6% (95%CI: 80.1%, 89.2%). The most common T&CM used were crab soup (85.3%), papaya leaf extract (64.2%) and isotonic drinks (61.8%).

Dengue has been recognized as one of the most important vector-borne human viral diseases globally. Currently, supportive care with vigilant monitoring is the standard practice since there is as yet no approved therapeutic modality to treat dengue. Even though the approved vaccine has become available, its low efficacy with the potential to cause harm is the major hurdle to promote the widespread usage of the vaccine. Despite the decades of research on dengue, the major challenge in dengue vaccine development is the absence of suitable experimental animal models that reflect the pathological features and clinical symptoms, as seen in humans. Dengue is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes carrying infectious dengue virus (DENV), which has four distinct serotypes. Recently, cases resulting from unconventional transmission routes, such as blood transfusion, organs as well as stem cells and bone marrow transplantations, and mother-to-infant vertical transmission, have been reported, suggesting an alternate route of DENV transmission exists in nature.

Coinfected individuals show higher CD4+ cell counts, lower HIV-1 RNA viral loads and live three times longer than clinically matched HIV-1 monoinfected patients.

ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-transmitted viral pathogen in humans. The recently licensed dengue vaccine has major weaknesses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop improved dengue vaccines. Here, we report a virion assembly-defective DENV as a vaccine platform. DENV containing an amino acid deletion (K188) in nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A) is fully competent in viral RNA replication but is completely defective in virion assembly. When trans-complemented with wild-type NS2A protein, the virion assembly defect could be rescued, generating pseudoinfectious virus (PIVNS2A) that could initiate single-round infection. The trans-complementation efficiency could be significantly improved through selection for adaptive mutations, leading to high-yield PIVNS2A production, with titers of >107 infectious-focus units (IFU)/ml. Mice immunized with a single dose of PIVNS2A elicited strong T cell immune responses and neutralization antibodies and were protected from wild-type-virus challenge. Collectively, the results proved the concept of using assembly-defective virus as a vaccine approach. The study also solved the technical bottleneck in producing high yields of PIVNS2A vaccine. The technology could be applicable to vaccine development for other viral pathogens. IMPORTANCE Many flaviviruses are significant human pathogens that pose global threats to public health.

The emergence of various viral serotypes has prompted the urgent need for innovative drug design techniques. Of the viral non-structural enzymes, the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been established as a promising target due to its lack of an enzymatic counterpart in mammalian cells and its conserved structure amongst all serotypes. The onus is now on scientists to probe further into understanding this enzyme and its mechanism of action. The field of bioinformatics has evolved greatly over recent decades, with updated drug design tools now being publically available. Methods In this study, bioinformatics tools were used to provide a comprehensive sequence and structural analysis of the two most prominent serotypes of Dengue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A list of popular flavivirus inhibitors were also chosen to dock to the active site of the enzyme. The best docked compound was then used as a template to generate a pharmacophore model that may assist in the design of target-specific Dengue virus inhibitors. Results Comparative sequence alignment exhibited similarity between all three domains of serotype 2 and 3.Sequence analysis revealed highly conserved regions at residues Meth530, Thr543 Asp597, Glu616, Arg659 and Pro671. Mapping of the active site demonstrated two highly conserved residues: Ser710 and Arg729. Of the active site interacting residues, Ser796 was common amongst all ten docked compounds, indicating its importance in the drug design process. Of the ten docked flavivirus inhibitors, NITD-203 showed the best binding affinity to the active site. Further pharmacophore modeling of NITD-203 depicted significant pharmacophoric elements that are necessary for stable binding to the active site. Discussion This study utilized publically available bioinformatics tools to provide a comprehensive framework on Dengue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Based on docking studies, a pharmacophore model was also designed to unveil the crucial pharmacophoric elements that are required when constructing an efficacious DENV inhibitor. We believe that this study will be a cornerstone in paving the road toward the design of target-specific inhibitors against DENV RdRp.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study provides a comprehensive sequence and structural analysis of the two most prominent serotypes of Dengue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to provide a comprehensive framework for the design of target-specific inhibitors against DENV RdRp."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1638,"details":{"paperId":"b230c56c8db133446c6c5fdc86284ef0a14e9fe0","externalIds":{"MAG":"2024846944","DOI":"10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.05.005","CorpusId":"207721725","PubMed":"22664189"},"title":"Using recombinant DNA technology for the development of live-attenuated dengue vaccines.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This paper reviews recombinant live-attenuated DEN vaccine candidates in terms of deletion, antigen chimerization, and the introduction of adaptive mutations, and strategies for improving tetravalent vaccine attenuation."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6045,"details":{"paperId":"cde50e17c87bd84e7571f389f845010e8194b688","externalIds":{"MAG":"2470881593","PubMedCentral":"5026288","DOI":"10.1371/currents.outbreaks.4ab8bc87c945eb41cd8a49e127082620","CorpusId":"6744342","PubMed":"27660733"},"title":"Utility of a Dengue-Derived Monoclonal Antibody to Enhance Zika Infection In Vitro","abstract":"Introduction: Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged in dengue (DENV) endemic areas, where these two related flaviviruses continue to co-circulate.

WN virus infection, although circulating in southern regions for many years, in recent years, WN encephalitis patients have been demonstrated. While vaccines against JE have been developed and decrease outbreaks, in case of DEN and WN, vaccines are still in developing level, especially, it has been difficult to achieve the long-term protective immune response. The first licensed DEN vaccine, which is a live attenuated vaccine, was administered in countries where the virus is endemic, and has a potential to cause serious side effects, especially when administered to younger population as observed in the Philippines vaccination drive. In the case of WN, although the purified inactivated virion-based vaccine worked effectively as a veterinary vaccine for horses, no effective vaccine has yet been licensed for humans. The induction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses is essential to complete protection by these viruses, as evidenced by responses to asymptomatic infections. Many studies have shown that neutralizing antibody (NAb) response is against surface structural proteins; CD4+ and CD8+ responses are mainly directed against nonstructural proteins rather than NAb response. New data suggest that encapsulating virus vaccines in nanoparticles (NPs) will direct antigen in cytoplasmic compartment by antigen-presenting cells, which will improve presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Vaccination would likely represent an effective strategy for the management of dengue disease in endemic regions, however to date there is only one licensed preventative vaccine for dengue infection. The development of a vaccine against dengue virus (DENV) has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of protective immune responses against DENV. The most clinically advanced dengue vaccine is the chimeric yellow fever-dengue vaccine (CYD) that employs the yellow fever virus 17D strain as the replication backbone (Chimerivax-DEN; CYD-TDV). This vaccine had an overall pooled protective efficacy of 65.6% but was substantially more effective against severe dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Several other vaccine approaches have been developed including live attenuated chimeric dengue vaccines (DENVax and LAV Delta 30), DEN protein subunit V180 vaccine (DEN1–80E) and DENV DNA vaccines. These vaccines have been shown to be immunogenic in animals and also safe and immunogenic in humans. However, these vaccines are yet to progress to phase III trials to determine their protective efficacy against dengue.

A high degree of antigenic match between vaccine strains and circulating DENVs may be important to achieve high vaccine efficacy (VE). Using data from two phase 3 trials of the CYD-TDV vaccine, we assessed whether and how VE against virologically confirmed dengue varied with amino acid sequence characteristics and genotypes of the disease-causing DENVs. VE decreased with the degree of amino acid dissimilarity between the vaccine insert and disease-causing DENVs. After accounting for differential VE by serotype, this effect seemed to occur only for younger children, who also had lower baseline seropositivity and potentially a less broadly protective immune response. Two phase 3 placebo-controlled trials of the CYD-TDV vaccine, evaluated in children aged 2−14 y (CYD14) and 9−16 y (CYD15), demonstrated vaccine efficacy (VE) of 56.5% and 60.8%, respectively, against symptomatic virologically confirmed dengue (VCD). Sieve analyses were conducted to evaluate whether and how VE varied with amino acid sequence features of dengue viruses (DENVs). DENV premembrane/envelope amino acid sequences from VCD endpoint cases were aligned with the vaccine insert sequences, and extensions of the proportional hazards model were applied to assess variation in VE with amino acid mismatch proportion distances from vaccine strains, individual amino acid residues, and phylogenetic genotypes. In CYD14, VE against VCD of any serotype (DENV-Any) decreased significantly with increasing amino acid distance from the vaccine, whereas in CYD15, VE against DENV-Any was distance-invariant. Restricting to the common age range and amino acid distance range between the trials and accounting for differential VE by serotype, however, showed no evidence of VE variation with distance in either trial. In serotype-specific analyses, VE against DENV4 decreased significantly with increasing amino acid distance from the DENV4 vaccine insert and was significantly greater against residue-matched DENV4 at eight signature positions. These effects were restricted to 2- to 8-y-olds, potentially because greater seropositivity of older children at baseline might facilitate a broader protective immune response. The relevance of an antigenic match between vaccine strains and circulating DENVs was also supported by greater estimated VE against serotypes and genotypes for which the circulating DENVs had shorter amino acid sequence distances from the vaccine.","publicationTypes":["Study","JournalArticle","ClinicalTrial"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The relevance of an antigenic match between vaccine strains and circulatingDENVs was supported by greater estimated VE against serotypes and genotypes for which the circulating DENVs had shorter amino acid sequence distances from the vaccine."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":1800,"details":{"paperId":"6e3a9f6b17a6339acd7e8e478f4aa741f1119dfe","externalIds":{"MAG":"2130149429","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcv.2013.06.016","CorpusId":"21878796","PubMed":"23845853"},"title":"Viral load in patients infected with dengue is modulated by the presence of anti-dengue IgM antibodies.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Comparison of viremia levels in sera from patients positive or negative for dengue IgM antibodies showed that viral load was significantly higher in patients negative for IgM, and levels of circulating NS1 were found unaffected by the presence of IgM."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":8077,"details":{"paperId":"6a390974b7d2e0e2a7ce0028c15ebe5f5adcf55f","externalIds":{"MAG":"3038513974","DOI":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.840.221","CorpusId":"218488628"},"title":"Virtual Screening Based on Pharmacophore to Discover Host ER Alpha-Glucosidase II Inhibitor for Dengue Therapy","abstract":"Dengue is one of the crucial diseases in human-caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection.

Thus, novel anti-dengue therapies are required for effective treatment. Human hexokinase II (HKII), which is the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, is an important drug target due to its significant impact on viral replication and survival in host cells. In this study, 23.1 million compounds were computationally-screened against HKII using the Ultrafast Shape Recognition with a CREDO Atom Types (USRCAT) algorithm. In total, 300 compounds with the highest similarity scores relative to three reference molecules, known as Alpha-D-glucose (GLC), Beta-D-glucose-6-phosphate (BG6), and 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), were aligned. Of these 300 compounds, 165 were chosen for further structure-based screening, based on their similarity scores, ADME analysis, the Lipinski’s Rule of Five, and virtual toxicity test results. The selected analogues were subsequently docked against each domain of the HKII structure (PDB ID: 2NZT) using AutoDock Vina programme. The three top-ranked compounds for each query were then selected from the docking results based on their binding energy, the number of hydrogen bonds formed, and the specific catalytic residues.

Therefore, the identification of chemicals with the potential to inhibit the formation of the NS1 protein dimer of DENV, YFV and ZIKV would enable them to act as a multi-target drug. For this, we selected conformations of the NS1 protein monomer with similar β-roll domain structure among the three virus species from conformations obtained from molecular dynamics simulations performed in GROMACS in 5 replicates of 150 ns for each species. After selecting the protein structures, a virtual screening of compounds from the natural products catalog of the ZINC database was performed using AutoDock Vina. The 100 best compounds were classified according efficiency criteria. Two compounds were observed in common to the species, with energy scores ranging from −9.2 kcal/mol to −10.1 kcal/mol.

We constructed candidate vaccines containing the DNA of five of the genotypes of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and evaluated the immunogenicity, the neutralizing (Nt) activity of the elicited antibodies, and the protective efficacy elicited in mice immunized with the vaccine candidates. We observed a significant correlation between the level of in vitro virus-like particle secretion, the elicited antibody response, and the protective efficacy of the vaccines containing the DNA of the different DENV genotypes in immunized mice. However, higher total IgG antibody levels did not always translate into higher Nt antibodies against homologous and heterologous viruses. We also found that, in contrast to previous reports, more than 50% of total IgG targeted ectodomain III (EDIII) of the E protein, and a substantial fraction of this population was interdomain highly neutralizing flavivirus subgroup-cross-reactive antibodies, such as monoclonal antibody 1B7-5. In addition, the lack of a critical epitope(s) in the Sylvatic genotype virus recognized by interdomain antibodies could be the major cause of the poor protection of mice vaccinated with the Asian 1 genotype vaccine (pVD2-Asian 1) from lethal challenge with virus of the Sylvatic genotype. In conclusion, although the pVD2-Asian 1 vaccine was immunogenic, elicited sufficient titers of Nt antibodies against all DENV-2 genotypes, and provided 100% protection against challenge with virus of the homologous Asian 1 genotype and virus of the heterologous Cosmopolitan genotype, it is critical to monitor the potential emergence of Sylvatic genotype viruses, since vaccine candidates under development may not protect vaccinated humans from these viruses. IMPORTANCE Five genotype-specific dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) DNA vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity, homologous and heterologous neutralizing (Nt) antibody titers, and cross-genotype protection in a murine model. The immunity elicited by our prototype vaccine candidate (Asian 1 genotype strain 16681) in mice was protective against viruses of other genotypes but not against virus of the Sylvatic genotype, whose emergence and potential risk after introduction into the human population have previously been demonstrated. The underlying mechanism of a lack of protection elicited by the prototype vaccine may at least be contributed by the absence of a flavivirus subgroup-cross-reactive, highly neutralizing monoclonal antibody 1B7-5-like epitope in DENV-2 of the Sylvatic genotype. The DENV DNA vaccine directs the synthesis and assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) and induces immune responses similar to those elicited by live-attenuated vaccines, and its flexibility permits the fast deployment of vaccine to combat emerging viruses, such as Sylvatic genotype viruses. The enhanced VLP secretion obtained by replacement of ectodomain I-II (EDI-II) of the Cosmopolitan genotype vaccine construct (VD2-Cosmopolitan) with the Asian 1 EDI-II elicited significantly higher total IgG and Nt antibody titers and suggests a novel approach to enhance the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine. A DENV vaccine capable of eliciting protective immunity against viruses of existing and emerging genotypes should be the focus of future DENV vaccine development.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The pVD2-Asian 1 vaccine was immunogenic, elicited sufficient titers of Nt antibodies against all DENV-2 genotypes, and provided 100% protection against challenge with virus of the homologous Asian 1 genotype and virus ofThe heterologous Cosmopolitan genotype, it is critical to monitor the potential emergence of Sylvatic genotype viruses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7977,"details":{"paperId":"d0fd66b6ba5c6753ff856451923e32277dcdea36","externalIds":{"MAG":"2974740310","PubMedCentral":"6963367","DOI":"10.3390/vaccines7040123","CorpusId":"202745722","PubMed":"31547131"},"title":"Virus-Like Particle Systems for Vaccine Development against Viruses in the Flaviviridae Family","abstract":"Viruses in the Flaviviridae family are important human and animal pathogens that impose serious threats to global public health.

Currently, no treatment is available to fight dengue symptoms. We and others have demonstrated the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of VitD3 as a possible therapy for DENV infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs responsible for the regulation of cell processes including antiviral defense. Previous transcriptomic analysis showed that VitD3 regulates the expression of genes involved in stress and immune response by inducing specific miRNAs. Here, we focus on the effects of VitD3 supplementation in the regulation of the expression of inflammatory-liked miR-182-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR125b-5p, miR146a-5p, and miR-155-5p during DENV-2 infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Further, we evaluated the effects of inhibition of these miRNAs in the innate immune response. Our results showed that supplementation with VitD3 differentially regulated the expression of these inflammatory miRNAs. We also observed that inhibition of miR-182-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-155-5p, led to decreased production of TNF-α and TLR9 expression, while increased the expression of SOCS-1, IFN-β, and OAS1, without affecting DENV replication. By contrast, over-expression of miR-182-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-155-5p significantly decreased DENV-2 infection rates and also DENV-2 replication in MDMs. Our results suggest that VitD3 immunomodulatory effects involve regulation of inflammation-linked miRNAs expression, which might play a key role in the inflammatory response during DENV infection.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results suggest that VitD3 immunomodulatory effects involve regulation of inflammation-linked miRNAs expression, which might play a key role in the inflammatory response during DENV infection."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":2848,"details":{"paperId":"4be5be0d5f6e18a6ec5f18666df8a15e77cc7456","externalIds":{"MAG":"2754058107","DOI":"10.1017/S0950268817002059","CorpusId":"28147973","PubMed":"28903788"},"title":"Vitamin D serostatus and dengue fever progression to dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome","abstract":"SUMMARY Vitamin D could modulate pathways leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS).

In addition to life-shortening, the wMelPop-infected mosquitoes also exhibit increased daytime activity and metabolic rates. Here we sought to quantify the blood-feeding behaviour of Wolbachia-infected females as an indicator of any virulence or energetic drain associated with Wolbachia infection. Methodology/Principal Findings In a series of blood-feeding trials in response to humans, we have shown that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes do not differ in their response time to humans, but that as they age they obtain fewer and smaller blood meals than Wolbachia-uninfected controls. Lastly, we observed a behavioural characteristic in the Wolbachia infected mosquitoes best described as a “bendy” proboscis that may explain the decreased biting success. Conclusions/Significance Taken together the evidence suggests that wMelPop infection may be causing tissue damage in a manner that intensifies with mosquito age and that leads to reduced blood-feeding success.

Although Wolbachia is known to inhibit flaviviruses in mosquitoes, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), it remains unclear how the endosymbiont interferes with viral replication cycle. In this study, we have carried out viral binding assays to investigate the impact of the Wolbachia strain wAlbB on the attachment of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) and ZIKV to Aedes aegypti Aag-2 cells. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to silence a variety of putative mosquito receptors of DENV that were differentially regulated by wAlbB in Aag-2 cells, in order to identify host factors involved in the inhibition of viral binding.

Wolbachia pipientis is a bacterial endosymbiont common to many insect species. Wolbachia transinfections in mosquito disease vectors have great value for disease control given the bacterium’s ability to spread into wild mosquito populations, and to interfere with infections of pathogens, such as dengue virus. Aedes fluviatilis is a mosquito with a widespread distribution in Latin America, but its status as a dengue vector has not been clarified. Ae. fluviatilis is also naturally infected by the wFlu Wolbachia strain, which has been demonstrated to enhance infection with the avian malarial parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum. We performed experimental infections of Ae. fluviatilis with DENV-2 and DENV-3 isolates from Brazil via injection or oral feeding to provide insight into its competence for the virus. We also examined the effect of the native Wolbachia infection on the virus using a mosquito line where the wFlu infection had been cleared by antibiotic treatment. Through RT-qPCR, we observed that Ae. fluviatilis could become infected with both viruses via either method of infection, although at a lower rate than Aedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. We then detected DENV-2 and DENV-3 in the saliva of injected mosquitoes, and observed that injection of DENV-3-infected saliva produced subsequent infections in naïve Ae. aegypti. However, across our data we observed no difference in prevalence of infection and viral load between Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes, suggesting that there is no effect of wFlu on dengue virus.

When introduced to nonnative mosquito hosts, Wolbachia induce resistance to a number of human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), Plasmodium, and filarial nematodes, but the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. In this study, we have deciphered how Wolbachia infection affects the Aedes aegypti host in inducing resistance to DENV. The microarray assay indicates that transcripts of genes with functions related to immunity and reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions are up-regulated in Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia. Infection with this bacterium leads to induction of oxidative stress and an increased level of reactive oxygen species in its mosquito host. Reactive oxygen species elevation is linked to the activation of the Toll pathway, which is essential in mediating the expression of antioxidants to counterbalance oxidative stress. This immune pathway also is responsible for activation of antimicrobial peptides—defensins and cecropins. We provide evidence that these antimicrobial peptides are involved in inhibition of DENV proliferation in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. Utilization of transgenic Ae. aegypti and the RNAi depletion approach has been instrumental in proving the role of defensins and cecropins in the resistance of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti to DENV.

Recently, we showed that Wolbachia uses host microRNAs to manipulate host gene expression for its efficient maintenance in the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Cytosine methylation is mediated by a group of proteins called DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases, which are structurally and functionally conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The biological functions of cytosine methylation include host defense, genome stability, gene regulation, developmental promotion of organs, and lifespan regulation. Ae. aegypti has only one DNA methyltransferase gene (AaDnmt2) belonging to the cytosine methyltransferase family 2, which is the most deeply conserved and widely distributed gene among metazoans.

The prM and E proteins appeared to be properly processed and glycosylated, and in plaque reduction neutralization tests and other assays of antigenic specificity, the E proteins exhibited profiles which resembled those of the homologous dengue virus serotypes. Both chimeric viruses replicated in cell lines of vertebrate and mosquito origin to levels comparable to those of homologous dengue viruses but less efficiently than the YF5.2iv parent. YFV/dengue-4 virus, but not YFV/dengue-2 virus, was neurovirulent for 3-week-old mice by intracerebral inoculation; however, both viruses were attenuated when administered by the intraperitoneal route in mice of that age. Single-dose inoculation of either chimeric virus at a dose of 105 PFU by the intraperitoneal route induced detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies against the homologous dengue virus strains. Mice which had been immunized in this manner were fully protected from challenge with homologous neurovirulent dengue viruses by intracerebral inoculation compared to unimmunized mice. Protection was associated with significant increases in geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibody compared to those for unimmunized mice. These data indicate that YFV/dengue virus chimeras elicit antibodies which represent protective memory responses in the mouse model of dengue encephalitis.

Additionally, antigenic similarities between Zika and dengue viruses can promote Zika virus infection by way of ADE in vitro using these very same anti-dengue antibodies. ABSTRACT Zika virus and dengue virus are evolutionarily related and structurally similar mosquito-borne Flaviviruses. These congruencies can lead to cross-reactive antibody binding, whereby antibodies generated from previous dengue virus immunity can augment Zika virus replication in vitro. This phenomenon, termed antibody-dependent enhancement, may participate in the clinical manifestations detected in areas with Flavivirus cocirculations where Zika virus is endemic; however, a causal relationship has yet to be determined. The KU812 mast cell/basophil line was integral in identifying the first Flavivirus infection in mast cells and serves as an effective in vitro model to study dengue virus antibody-dependent enhancement. Mast cells, sentinel white blood cells intrinsic in coordinating early immune defenses, are characteristically situated in the intradermal space and are therefore among the first immune cells interfaced with blood-feeding mosquitoes. Here, we tested whether KU812 cells were permissive to Zika virus, how previous dengue virus immunity might augment Zika virus infection, and whether either condition induces an immunological response. We report an antibody-dependent enhancement effect of Zika virus infection in KU812 cells across multiple time points (48, 72, and 96 hours postinfection [hpi]) and a range of multiplicities of infection (4.0 × 10−3 to 4) using various concentrations of cross-reactive dengue virus monoclonal antibodies (D11C and 1.6D). This antigen-specific antibody-mediated infection was selectively coupled to chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) secretion and a reduction in granzyme B (GrB) release. Therefore, mast cells and/or basophils may significantly augment Zika virus infection in the context of preexisting dengue virus immunity. IMPORTANCE Antibodies generated against one dengue serotype can enhance infection of another by a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, antigenic similarities between Zika and dengue viruses can promote Zika virus infection by way of ADE in vitro using these very same anti-dengue antibodies. We used the KU812 cell line to demonstrate for the first time that anti-dengue antibodies enhanced infectious Zika virus replication in a mast cell model and specifically increased CCL5, CXCL10, and IL-1β, while also impairing granzyme B secretion. Furthermore, enhanced Zika virus infection and selective mediator release were mechanistically dependent on fragment crystallizable gamma receptor II (FcγRII).

The Zika pandemic sparked intense interest in whether immune interactions among dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1 to -4) extend to the closely related Zika virus (ZIKV). We investigated prospective pediatric cohorts in Nicaragua that experienced sequential DENV1 to -3 (2004 to 2015), Zika (2016 to 2017), and DENV2 (2018 to 2020) epidemics. Risk of symptomatic DENV2 infection and severe disease was elevated by one prior ZIKV infection, one prior DENV infection, or one prior DENV infection followed by one ZIKV infection, compared with being flavivirus-naïve.

Further, although high preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers protected against DENV1, DENV3, and ZIKV disease, intermediate titers induced by previous ZIKV or DENV infection enhanced future risk of DENV2 disease and severity, as well as DENV3 severity.

The CYD-TDV dengue vaccine produced by Sanofi-Pasteur is the only dengue vaccine evaluated in phase 3 controlled clinical trials. Notwithstanding the significant contribution to the development of a vaccine against dengue, the three phase 3 clinical studies of CYD-TDV and the meta-analysis of the long-term follow up of those studies, have provided evidence that this vaccine exhibited partial vaccine efficacy to protect against virologically confirmed dengue and lead to four considerations: a) adequate vaccine efficacy against dengue virus (DENV) infections 3 and 4, less vaccine efficacy against DENV 1 and no protection against infection by DENV 2; b) decreased vaccine efficacy in dengue seronegative individuals at the beginning of the vaccination; c) 83% and 90% protection against hospitalizations and severe forms of dengue, respectively, at 25 months follow-up; and d) increased hospitalization for dengue in the vaccinated group, in children under nine years of age at the time of vaccination, detected since the third year of follow-up. The benefit of the CYD-TDV vaccine can be summarized in the protection against infection by DENV 3 and 4, as well as protection for hospitalizations and severe cases in people over nine years, who have had previous dengue infection, working mainly as a booster. In this review we identified elements on efficacy and safety of this vaccine that must be taken into account in the licensing process and potential inclusion in the national vaccination program of Mexico. The available scientific evidence on the CYD-TDV vaccine shows merits, but also leads to relevant questions that should be answered to properly assess the safety profile of the product and the target populations of potential benefit. In this regard we consider it would be informative to complete the 6-year follow-up after starting vaccination, according to the company's own study protocol recommended by the World Health Organization. As with any new vaccine, the potential licensing and implementation of the CYD-TDV as part of Mexico's vaccination program, requires a clear definition of the balance between the expected benefits and risks. Particularly with a vaccine with variable efficacy and some signs of risk, in the probable case of licensing, the post-licensed period must involve the development of detailed protocols to immediately identify risks or any health event associated with vaccination.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is considered it would be informative to complete the 6-year follow-up after starting vaccination, according to the company's own study protocol recommended by the World Health Organization."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":6912,"details":{"paperId":"2ac482af8fe5a62d3af24f834bce10de59282d67","externalIds":{"MAG":"2131982581","DOI":"10.1590/S1020-49892000000500001","CorpusId":"13462452","PubMed":"10893968"},"title":"[Development of immunizing agents against dengue].","abstract":"The four serotypes of dengue flaviviruses are transmitted mainly by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and some epidemics have been attributed to Ae. albopictus, Ae. polynesiensis, and various species of the Ae. scutellaris complex. The risk factors involved in dengue mortality and morbidity are related to the human host (genetic characteristics of infected persons; lifestyles, immune status, and health conditions of people; basic sanitation of dwellings; and water supply) and to the virus (genetic variability between and among serotypes, different pathogenicities, and geographic distribution). Notwithstanding the lack of knowledge of the immunopathobiology of dengue fever, important advances have been made in terms of a protective immune response, using attenuated dengue viruses or antigens produced by means of recombinant technologies. Efforts have been made since the 1940s to develop dengue vaccines. Immunity acquired from natural infection is specific for each serotype, and as many as three different serotype infections have been reported in one individual. For this reason, a tetravalent vaccine may likely be needed. Candidate vaccines against the four serotypes have been tested in volunteers and have proven to be immunogenic and safe. Although attenuated live virus vaccines are promising, more study is needed regarding their effectiveness and safety. Currently, several studies are ongoing to develop dengue vaccines using antigens from structural proteins (particularly E glycoprotein) and nonstructural proteins, with recombinant DNA technology and other biomolecular technologies. With the same goal, various expression vectors are being used, including Escherichia coli, baculovirus, vaccinia virus, and yellow fever virus. Unfortunately, no satisfactory results have been obtained in humans. The need for effective dengue vaccines is great, given the serious worldwide problem of the transmission of the four serotypes. Effective immunization against dengue would contribute to its prevention, with a positive cost-benefit relationship.

Currently, there is no vaccine or effective antiviral therapy to prevent or to treat dengue virus infection. The slow progress in developing antiviral agents might be alleviated by the availability of efficient high-throughput anti-dengue virus screening assays. In this study, we report an immunofluorescence image-based assay suitable for identification of small molecule inhibitors of dengue virus infection and replication. Using this assay, we have discovered that inhibitors of the c-Src protein kinase exhibit a potent inhibitory effect on dengue virus (serotypes 1–4) and murine flavivirus Modoc. Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that the c-Src protein kinase inhibitor dasatinib prevents the assembly of dengue virions within the virus-induced membranous replication complex. These results demonstrate that this cell-based screen may provide a powerful means to identify new potential targets for anti-dengue drug development while simultaneously providing pharmacological probes to investigate dengue virus–host cell interactions at the biochemical level. Given the simplicity and excellent reproducibility of the assay, it should be useful in high-throughput screens of both small molecule and RNAi libraries when implemented on a robotic image-based high-throughput screen (HTS) platform. Given the reasonable clinical safety of inhibitors such as dasatinib and AZD0530, inhibitors of c-Src protein kinase may have the potential to become a new class of anti-dengue viral therapeutic agents.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Study"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An immunofluorescence image-based assay suitable for identification of small molecule inhibitors of dengue virus infection and replication is reported and it is discovered that inhibitors of the c-Src protein kinase exhibit a potent inhibitory effect on d Dengue virus and murine flavivirus Modoc."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":7989,"details":{"paperId":"29c74ab6f7d0f51c02af55f110f8fe07d83ee937","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7918459","DOI":"10.3390/vaccines9020148","CorpusId":"232086284","PubMed":"33673131"},"title":"mRNA Vaccines against Flaviviruses","abstract":"Numerous vaccines have now been developed using the mRNA platform.
