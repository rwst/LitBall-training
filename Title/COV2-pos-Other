ABSTRACT An accurate diagnostic test for early severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the key weapon to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We previously reported that the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a unique orf8 accessory gene absent from other human-pathogenic coronaviruses. Here, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 orf8 as a novel immunogenic secreted protein and utilized it for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Extracellular orf8 protein was detected in cell culture supernatant and in sera of COVID-19 patients. In addition, orf8 was found highly immunogenic in COVID-19 patients, who showed early seropositivity for anti-orf8 IgM, IgG, and IgA. We hypothesize that orf8 secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates early mounting of B cell response. The serological test detecting anti-orf8 IgG antibody can be used for the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Current commercially available serological tests for COVID-19 patients are detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike glycoprotein.

Transfusion of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients is currently being explored; neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma is thought to play a central role in the efficacy of this treatment. Here, we observed that plasma neutralization activity decreased a few weeks after the onset of the symptoms. If neutralizing activity is required for the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that convalescent plasma should be recovered rapidly after the donor recovers from active infection. ABSTRACT In the absence of effective vaccines and with limited therapeutic options, convalescent plasma is being collected across the globe for potential transfusion to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The therapy has been deemed safe, and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of â‰¥1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here, we performed repeated analyses at 1-month intervals on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that the levels of receptor-binding-domain (RBD)-specific IgG and IgA slightly decreased between 6 and 10 weeks after the onset of symptoms but that RBD-specific IgM levels decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S or its D614G variant. If neutralization activity proves to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after resolution of symptoms.

One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Multiple assays have been developed to validate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; most of them utilized lentiviral or vesicular stomatitis virus-based particles pseudotyped with the spike (S) protein, making them safe and acceptable to work with in many labs. However, these systems are only capable of measuring infection with purified particles. This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera. Based on available studies, this is the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection, for which the mechanisms are largely unknown. The findings suggest that this route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be of great importance for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Importance Immune surveillance of viral or bacterial infections is largely mediated by neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are produced after vaccination or infection, but their titers only partly reflect the degree of protection against infection. To identify protective antibodies, a neutralization test with replicating viruses or pseudoviruses (PVs) is required. This study developed lentiviral-based PV neutralization assays that, unlike similar systems reported earlier, enable quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in cell cocultures. Using both PVs and replication-competent virus, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection is considerably more resistant to serum neutralization than infection with purified viral particles. The tests are easy to set up in many labs, and are believed to be more informative for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 collective immunity or entry inhibitor screening.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell is developed, the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection."}},"tag":"OTHER"},{"id":99,"details":{"paperId":"8e3194ad86db6ae8013c5ef40cd6338a74b74027","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7980144","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.036","CorpusId":"232283312","PubMed":"33794143"},"title":"SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 and P.1 escape from neutralizing antibodies","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may escape neutralizing antibody responses, which has important implications for efforts to contain the pandemic."}},"tag":"OTHER"},{"id":142,"details":{"paperId":"a2e31d6baf68e8815361ce0f18e1662dcfa26bdc","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7985683","DOI":"10.1016/j.gene.2021.145596","CorpusId":"232321605","PubMed":"33766711"},"title":"SARS-CoV-2 variants lacking ORF8 occurred in farmed mink and pangolin","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The identification of variants without ORF8 (E19stop) and with the N501T spike mutation circulated in farmed mink and humans from Denmark, highlighting the danger of having reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses where more transmissible variants may occur and spill over to humans."}},"tag":"OTHER"}]
