Here we report the sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain passaged six times after original isolation from a clinical patient in Hong Kong. The genome sequence shows a 27 nt in-frame deletion (Δ27,264-27,290) within ORF6, predicted to result in a 9 aa deletion (ΔFKVSIWNLD) from the central portion of p6.

Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells.

Compared with the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complexes, the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface in this RdRp complex shifts away from the nsp12 polymerase. Further functional characterizations suggest that specific interactions between the nsp8(I) and nsp7, together with the rearrangement of nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, ensure the efficient and processive RNA synthesis by the RdRp complex.

Currently, no highly effective and specific antiviral drug is available for clinical treatment. Therefore, the threat of COVID-19 transmission necessitates the discovery of more effective antiviral strategies. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important antiviral drug target. Here, our cryo-EM structure of a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/RNA replicating complex reveals a previously uncharacterized overall shift of the cofactor nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, leading to its rearrangement.

To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the local RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds primarily to ACE2 on target cells and is then processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, leading to viral internalisation or fusion with the plasma membrane. It has been suggested, however, that receptors other than ACE2 may be involved in virus binding. We have investigated the interactions of recombinant versions of the spike protein with human epithelial cell lines that express low/very low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a proxy assay for interaction with host cells. A tagged form of the spike protein containing the S1 and S2 regions bound in a temperature-dependent manner to all cell lines, whereas the S1 region alone and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacted only weakly. Spike protein associated with cells independently of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, while RBD required the presence of high levels of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we tested the effects of various heparins on ACE2-independent spike protein interaction with cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of <0.05 U/mL, whereas two low-molecular-weight heparins were less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the arginine-rich putative furin cleavage site, interacted only weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin than the wild-type spike protein. This suggests that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin-binding site and potentially important for interactions with host cells.

Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is long-lived after entry, suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular nucleases.

The antinucleoprotein and antispike antibodies can be accurately detected in patients during the mid or late stage of infection, and therefore, these assays have not been widely used for early diagnosis of COVID-19. In this study, we characterized the secretory property of a SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein and proposed that orf8 secretion during infection facilitates early mounting of the B cell response.

Our serological test detecting anti-orf8 antibodies may facilitate the development of early and accurate diagnosis for COVID-19. ABSTRACT An accurate diagnostic test for early severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the key weapon to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We previously reported that the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a unique orf8 accessory gene absent from other human-pathogenic coronaviruses. Here, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 orf8 as a novel immunogenic secreted protein and utilized it for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Extracellular orf8 protein was detected in cell culture supernatant and in sera of COVID-19 patients. In addition, orf8 was found highly immunogenic in COVID-19 patients, who showed early seropositivity for anti-orf8 IgM, IgG, and IgA. We hypothesize that orf8 secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates early mounting of B cell response. The serological test detecting anti-orf8 IgG antibody can be used for the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Current commercially available serological tests for COVID-19 patients are detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike glycoprotein. The antinucleoprotein and antispike antibodies can be accurately detected in patients during the mid or late stage of infection, and therefore, these assays have not been widely used for early diagnosis of COVID-19.

They also illuminated the vast disparity in the methods used to produce RdRp for experimental work and the hidden impact that this has on enzyme activity and research outcomes. ABSTRACT The catalytic subunit of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) Nsp12 has a unique nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain that transfers nucleoside monophosphates to the Nsp9 protein and the nascent RNA. The NiRAN and RdRp modules form a dynamic interface distant from their catalytic sites, and both activities are essential for viral replication. We report that codon-optimized (for the pause-free translation in bacterial cells) Nsp12 exists in an inactive state in which NiRAN-RdRp interactions are broken, whereas translation by slow ribosomes and incubation with accessory Nsp7/8 subunits or nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) partially rescue RdRp activity. Our data show that adenosine and remdesivir triphosphates promote the synthesis of A-less RNAs, as does ppGpp, while amino acid substitutions at the NiRAN-RdRp interface augment activation, suggesting that ligand binding to the NiRAN catalytic site modulates RdRp activity.

The viral spike glycoprotein is the main target of host neutralizing antibodies that help to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and are important for the protection provided by vaccines. ABSTRACT The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, uses its spike (S) glycoprotein anchored in the viral membrane to enter host cells. The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E, and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to purify the Golgi-modified fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on other characterized S trimer preparations, is predominantly modified in the Golgi compartment by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, uses its spike glycoprotein to enter host cells. The viral spike glycoprotein is the main target of host neutralizing antibodies that help to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and are important for the protection provided by vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein consists of a trimer of two subunits covered with a coat of carbohydrates (sugars). Here, we describe the disulfide bonds that assist the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to assume the correct shape and the composition of the sugar moieties on the glycoprotein surface.

Here, we examine the architecture and self‐assembly properties of the SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid protein, which packages viral RNA into new virions. We determined a 1.4 Å resolution crystal structure of this protein's N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer similar to that of related coronaviruses including SARS‐CoV. While the N2b domain forms a dimer in solution, addition of the C‐terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates formation of a homotetramer. Using hydrogen‐deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an α‐helix that self‐associates and cooperates with the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of amino acid substitutions in the N protein from over 38,000 SARS‐CoV‐2 genome sequences. We find that these substitutions are strongly clustered in the protein's N2a linker domain, and that substitutions within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces.

Arginine methylation of N protein was confirmed by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated by cell culture.

ABSTRACT In 2019, a new pandemic virus belonging to the betacoronavirus family emerged, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China, and is responsible for severe respiratory pneumonia in humans, namely, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Having infected almost 200 million people worldwide and caused more than 4.1 million deaths as of today, this new disease has raised a significant number of questions about its molecular mechanism of replication and, in particular, how infectious viral particles are produced. Although viral entry is well characterized, the full assembly steps of SARS-CoV-2 have still not been fully described. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have four main structural proteins, namely, the spike glycoprotein (S), the membrane glycoprotein (M), the envelope protein (E), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). All these proteins have key roles in the process of coronavirus assembly and budding. In this review, we gathered the current knowledge about betacoronavirus structural proteins involved in viral particle assembly, membrane curvature and scission, and then egress in order to suggest and question a coherent model for SARS-CoV-2 particle production and release.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review gathered the current knowledge about betacoronavirus structural proteins involved in viral particle assembly, membrane curvature and scission, and then egress in order to suggest and question a coherent model for SARS-CoV-2 particle production and release."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":231,"details":{"paperId":"2c25e577fa3dfbbe07cb6b778bfd671e620b5020","externalIds":{"MAG":"3088579397","PubMedCentral":"7523240","DOI":"10.1021/acscentsci.0c01056","CorpusId":"222067890","PubMed":"33140034"},"title":"Beyond Shielding: The Roles of Glycans in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein","abstract":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 28,000,000 infections and 900,000 deaths worldwide to date. Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Similar to many other viral fusion proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the roles of glycans and on the protein structure and dynamics. We reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike’s receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for ACE2 recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift toward the “down” state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which may be exploited in the therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional and structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its glycan coat, providing a strategy to control the conformational plasticity of the RBD that could be harnessed for vaccine development.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike’s receptor binding domain (RBD) is revealed, which reduces binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift toward the “down” state."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":438,"details":{"paperId":"23f8f64e665da6c6e2ec74e4fccfa96c110feb6a","externalIds":{"MAG":"3096612840","PubMedCentral":"7605516","DOI":"10.1080/07391102.2020.1839564","CorpusId":"225100958","PubMed":"33111618"},"title":"Binding mechanism and structural insights into the identified protein target of COVID-19 and importin-α with in-vitro effective drug ivermectin","abstract":"Abstract While an FDA approved drug Ivermectin was reported to dramatically reduce the cell line of SARS-CoV-2 by ∼5000 folds within 48 h, the precise mechanism of action and the COVID-19 molecular target involved in interaction with this in-vitro effective drug are unknown yet.

We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC50s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays.

This paper considers the hypothesis that viral binding to cell-surface integrins may contribute to the high infectivity and widespread extra-pulmonary impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This potential is suggested on the basis of the emergence of an RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) sequence in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. RGD is a motif commonly used by viruses to bind cell-surface integrins. Numerous signaling pathways are mediated by integrins and virion binding could lead to dysregulation of these pathways, with consequent tissue damage. Integrins on the surfaces of pneumocytes, endothelial cells and platelets may be vulnerable to CoV-2 virion binding. For instance, binding of intact virions to integrins on alveolar cells could enhance viral entry. Binding of virions to integrins on endothelial cells could activate angiogenic cell signaling pathways; dysregulate integrin-mediated signaling pathways controlling developmental processes; and precipitate endothelial activation to initiate blood clotting. Such a procoagulant state, perhaps together with enhancement of platelet aggregation through virions binding to integrins on platelets, could amplify the production of microthrombi that pose the threat of pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, strokes and other thrombotic consequences. The susceptibility of different tissues to virion–integrin interactions may be modulated by a host of factors, including the conformation of relevant integrins and the impact of the tissue microenvironment on spike protein conformation. Patient-specific differences in these factors may contribute to the high variability of clinical presentation. There is danger that the emergence of receptor-binding domain mutations that increase infectivity may also enhance access of the RGD motif for integrin binding, resulting in viral strains with ACE2 independent routes of cell entry and novel integrin-mediated biological and clinical impacts. The highly infectious variant, B.1.1.7 (or VUI 202012/01), includes a receptor-binding domain amino acid replacement, N501Y, that could potentially provide the RGD motif with enhanced access to cell-surface integrins, with consequent clinical impacts.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The hypothesis that viral binding to cell-surface integrins may contribute to the high infectivity and widespread extra-pulmonary impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is considered."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":569,"details":{"paperId":"e3a5ea97f2ebbca0f839e3576cec565c2267ceec","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1101/2021.05.28.446179","CorpusId":"235249318"},"title":"Biophysical characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein","abstract":"SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic which continues to wreak havoc across the world, over a year and a half after its effects were first reported in the general media.

TLR4 is an innate immune receptor on the cell surface that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral proteins and triggers the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines to combat infection. It is expressed on both immune cells and tissue-resident cells. ACE2, the reported entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is only present on ~1-2% of the cells in the lungs or has a low pulmonary expression, and recently, the spike protein has been proposed to have the strongest protein-protein interaction with TLR4. Here, we review and connect evidence for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 having direct and indirect binding to TLR4, together with other viral precedents, which when combined shed light on the COVID-19 pathophysiological puzzle. We propose a model in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds TLR4 and activates TLR4 signalling to increase cell surface expression of ACE2 facilitating entry. SARS-CoV-2 also destroys the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactants, which normally decrease the air/tissue surface tension and block TLR4 in the lungs thus promoting ARDS and inflammation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis and multiple-organ injury may be due to TLR4 activation, aberrant TLR4 signalling, and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TLR4 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and its overactivation causes a prolonged or excessive innate immune response. TLR4 appears to be a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19, and since TLR4 antagonists have been previously trialled in sepsis and in other antiviral contexts, we propose the clinical trial testing of TLR4 antagonists in the treatment of severe COVID-19. Also, ongoing clinical trials of pulmonary surfactants in COVID-19 hold promise since they also block TLR4.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"TLR4 appears to be a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19, and since TLR4 antagonists have been previously trialled in sepsis and in other antiviral contexts, this work proposes the clinical trial testing of TLR 4 antagonists in the treatment of severe CO VID-19."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":25,"details":{"paperId":"1fbb5fc95a72d49271909d1b174afbe87a10276f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8661809","DOI":"10.1002/pro.4221","CorpusId":"242937335","PubMed":"34734665"},"title":"CTD of SARS‐CoV‐2 N protein is a cryptic domain for binding ATP and nucleic acid that interplay in modulating phase separation","abstract":"SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid (N) protein plays essential roles in many steps of the viral life cycle, thus representing a key drug target. N protein contains the folded N‐/C‐terminal domains (NTD/CTD) and three intrinsically disordered regions, while its functions including liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) depend on the capacity in binding various viral/host‐cell RNA/DNA of diverse sequences. Previously NTD was established to bind various RNA/DNA while CTD to dimerize/oligomerize for forming high‐order structures. By NMR, here for the first time we decrypt that CTD is not only capable of binding S2m, a specific probe derived from SARS‐CoV‐2 gRNA but with the affinity even higher than that of NTD. Very unexpectedly, ATP, the universal energy currency for all living cells with high cellular concentrations (2–16 mM), specifically binds CTD with Kd of 1.49 ± 0.28 mM. Strikingly, the ATP‐binding residues of NTD/CTD are identical in the SARS‐CoV‐2 variants while ATP and S2m interplay in binding NTD/CTD, as well as in modulating LLPS critical for the viral life cycle. Results together not only define CTD as a novel binding domain for ATP and nucleic acid, but enforce our previous proposal that ATP has been evolutionarily exploited by SARS‐CoV‐2 to complete its life cycle in the host cell. Most importantly, the unique ATP‐binding pockets on NTD/CTD may offer promising targets for design of specific anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 molecules to fight the pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both use human ACE2 as entry receptor and human proteases as entry activators. Using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays and SARS-CoV as a comparison, we have identified key cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that potentially contribute to the immune evasion, cell infectivity, and wide spread of the virus. This study also clarifies conflicting reports from recent studies on cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, by highlighting the potency and the evasiveness of SARS-CoV-2, the study provides insight into intervention strategies that target its cell entry mechanisms. A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells is a high priority for deciphering its mystery and curbing its spread. A virus surface spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. To fulfill its function, SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its receptor human ACE2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases. Here we investigated receptor binding and protease activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays. Our findings have identified key cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. First, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV RBD, supporting efficient cell entry. Second, paradoxically, the hACE2 binding affinity of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike is comparable to or lower than that of SARS-CoV spike, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit more potent, is less exposed than SARS-CoV RBD. Third, unlike SARS-CoV, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is preactivated by proprotein convertase furin, reducing its dependence on target cell proteases for entry. The high hACE2 binding affinity of the RBD, furin preactivation of the spike, and hidden RBD in the spike potentially allow SARS-CoV-2 to maintain efficient cell entry while evading immune surveillance. These features may contribute to the wide spread of the virus. Successful intervention strategies must target both the potency of SARS-CoV-2 and its evasiveness.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Key cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that potentially contribute to the immune evasion, cell infectivity, and wide spread of the virus are identified using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays and the potency and evasiveness are highlighted."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":713,"details":{"paperId":"b6d14f9ee4c9412a1285f1cb5231fb89cece4f1d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3196971151","PubMedCentral":"8664391","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.28088","CorpusId":"237484569","PubMed":"34917266"},"title":"Cell fusion as a link between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, COVID-19 complications, and vaccine side effects","abstract":"A distinctive feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is its ability to efficiently fuse cells, thus producing syncytia found in COVID-19 patients.

To delineate the impact of S1 spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor, we incubated the S1 spike protein with human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAEC). HPAEC treatment with the S1 spike protein caused disruption of endothelial barrier function, increased levels of numerous inflammatory molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-1β, CCL5, CXCL10), elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a mild rise in glycolytic reserve capacity. Because low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is associated with severe cases of COVID-19, we also evaluated treatment with hemoglobin (HbA) as a potential countermeasure in hypoxic and normal oxygen environments in analyses with the S1 spike protein. We found hypoxia downregulated the expression of the ACE2 receptor and increased the critical oxygen homeostatic signaling protein, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α); however, treatment of the cells with HbA yielded no apparent change in the levels of ACE2 or HIF-1α. Use of quantitative proteomics revealed that S1 spike protein-treated cells have few differentially regulated proteins in hypoxic conditions, consistent with the finding that ACE2 serves as the host viral receptor and is reduced in hypoxia. However, in normoxic conditions, we found perturbed abundance of proteins in signaling pathways related to lysosomes, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and pyrimidine metabolism.

SARS‐CoV‐2 is a new member of the betacoronavirus genus like other closely related viruses including SARS‐CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV). Both SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV have caused serious outbreaks and epidemics in the past eighteen years. Here, we report that one of the interferon‐stimulated genes (ISGs), cholesterol 25‐hydroxylase (CH25H), is induced by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in vitro and in COVID‐19‐infected patients. CH25H converts cholesterol to 25‐hydrocholesterol (25HC) and 25HC shows broad anti‐coronavirus activity by blocking membrane fusion. Furthermore, 25HC inhibits USA‐WA1/2020 SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in lung epithelial cells and viral entry in human lung organoids. Mechanistically, 25HC inhibits viral membrane fusion by activating the ER‐localized acyl‐CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) which leads to the depletion of accessible cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Altogether, our results shed light on a potentially broad antiviral mechanism by 25HC through depleting accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane to suppress virus–cell fusion. Since 25HC is a natural product with no known toxicity at effective concentrations, it provides a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID‐19 and emerging viral diseases in the future.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results shed light on a potentially broad antiviral mechanism by 25HC through depleting accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane to suppress virus–cell fusion and provide a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID‐19 and emerging viral diseases in the future."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":771,"details":{"paperId":"3efcda6140247ae4ff101d90dd7a1f3d3d59e1af","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8719300","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2021.796855","CorpusId":"245148276","PubMed":"34975904"},"title":"Cholesterol-Rich Lipid Rafts as Platforms for SARS-CoV-2 Entry","abstract":"Since its appearance, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents a global problem for human health that involves the host lipid homeostasis.

These regions enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol recruit and concentrate several receptors and molecules involved in pathogen recognition and cellular signaling. Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts have multiple functions for viral replication; however, their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. In this review, we discussed the novel evidence on the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 entry, where receptors such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), human Toll-like receptors (TLRs), transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS), CD-147 and HDL-scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) are recruited for their interaction with the viral spike protein.

A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein–protein interactions of two hCoV nonstructural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-OC43—an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologues from related strains. We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ signaling and mitochondria biogenesis. We also identify nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response associated proteins, and antiviral innate immune signaling factors.

Considerable efforts are focused on developing treatments, and therapies that work across coronaviruses would be particularly valuable. Shedding light on the host factors hijacked by the viruses, Gordon et al. mapped the interactions between viral and human proteins for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV; analyzed the localization of viral proteins in human cells; and used genetic screening to identify host factors that either enhance or inhibit viral infection.

Science, this issue p. eabe9403 Comparison of host interactions of three lethal coronaviruses identifies commonly hijacked pathways and potential drug targets. INTRODUCTION The emergence of three lethal coronaviruses in <20 years and the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted efforts to develop new therapeutic strategies, including by repurposing existing agents. After performing a comparative analysis of the three pathogenic human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we identified shared biology and host-directed drug targets to prioritize therapeutics with potential for rapid deployment against current and future coronavirus outbreaks. RATIONALE Expanding on our recent SARS-CoV-2 interactome, we mapped the virus-host protein-protein interactions for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV and assessed the cellular localization of each viral protein across the three strains. We conducted two genetic screens of SARS-CoV-2 interactors to prioritize functionally-relevant host factors and structurally characterized one virus-host interaction. We then tested the clinical relevance of three more host factors by assessing risk in genetic cohorts or observing effectiveness of host factor–targeting drugs in real-world evidence. RESULTS Quantitative comparison of the 389 interactors of SARS-CoV-2, 366 of SARS-CoV-1, and 296 of MERS-CoV highlighted interactions with host processes that are conserved across all three viruses, including where nonorthologous proteins from different virus strains seem to fill similar roles. We also localized each individually-expressed viral protein by microscopy and then raised and validated antisera against 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins to determine their localization during infection. On the basis of two independent genetic perturbation screens, we identified 73 host factors that, when depleted, caused significant changes in SARS-CoV-2 replication. From this list of potential drug targets, we validated the biological and clinical relevance of Tom70, IL17RA, PGES-2, and SigmaR1. A 3-Å cryo–electron microscopy structure of Tom70, a mitochondrial import receptor, in complex with SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b, provides insight into how ORF9b may modulate the host immune response. Using curated genome-wide association study data, we found that individuals with genotypes corresponding to higher soluble IL17RA levels in plasma are at decreased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. To demonstrate the value of our data for drug repurposing, we identified SARS-CoV-2 patients who were prescribed drugs against prioritized targets and asked how they fared compared with carefully matched patients treated with clinically similar drugs that do not inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Both indomethacin, an inhibitor of host factor PGES-2, and typical antipsychotics, selected for their interaction with sigma receptors, showed effectiveness against COVID-19 compared with celecoxib and atypical antipsychotics, respectively. CONCLUSION By employing an integrative and collaborative approach, we identified conserved mechanisms across three pathogenic coronavirus strains and further investigated potential drug targets. This versatile approach is broadly applicable to other infectious agents and disease areas. Overview of the approaches taken for systemic and functional comparison of pathogenic human coronaviruses.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a grave threat to public health and the global economy. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the more lethal but less transmissible coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we have carried out comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction and viral protein localization analyses for all three viruses. Subsequent functional genetic screening identified host factors that functionally impinge on coronavirus proliferation, including Tom70, a mitochondrial chaperone protein that interacts with both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b, an interaction we structurally characterized using cryo–electron microscopy. Combining genetically validated host factors with both COVID-19 patient genetic data and medical billing records identified molecular mechanisms and potential drug treatments that merit further molecular and clinical study.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The authors identified shared biology and host-directed drug targets to prioritize therapeutics with potential for rapid deployment against current and future coronavirus outbreaks, and found that individuals with genotypes corresponding to higher soluble IL17RA levels in plasma are at decreased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":223,"details":{"paperId":"e689dc68484da50a1ecb657d029547202b755edb","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7586457","MAG":"3092658851","DOI":"10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03301","CorpusId":"223559203","PubMed":"33064451"},"title":"Comprehensive Analysis of the Glycan Complement of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Proteins Using Signature Ions-Triggered Electron-Transfer/Higher-Energy Collisional Dissociation (EThcD) Mass Spectrometry","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remain elusive. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the viral pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As of 19 May 2021, John Hopkins University’s COVID-19 tracking platform reported 3.3 million deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, the World Health Organization has granted emergency use listing (EUL) to six COVID-19 vaccine candidates. However, much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse-genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) constructs; we removed individual viral ORF3a, −6, −7a, −7b, and −8 proteins from them, and we characterized the resulting recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF-deficient (ΔORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of ΔORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the ΔORF rSARS-CoV-2s identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while ΔORF7a, ΔORF7b, and ΔORF8 rSARS-CoV-2s induced pathology comparable to that of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse-genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 constructs and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Despite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remain elusive. Our study aims (i) to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins to viral pathogenesis and disease outcome and (ii) to develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse-genetics system to generate recombinant SARS-CoV-2 constructs with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as a foundation for generating attenuated forms of the virus to develop live attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study demonstrates the robustness of the reverse-genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 constructs and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS- covirus 2 for their implementation as live attenuated vaccines for the treatment of Sars-Cov-2 infection and associated COVID-19."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":793,"details":{"paperId":"50b32efe8b742b4ad8e72be5a691de5eca7e58c1","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8159090","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22105336","CorpusId":"231631081","PubMed":"34069441"},"title":"Contribution of Syndecans to the Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel emerging pathogen causing an unprecedented pandemic in 21st century medicine. Due to the significant health and economic burden of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, there is a huge unmet medical need for novel interventions effectively blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unknown details of SARS-CoV-2 cellular biology hamper the development of potent and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been reported to be the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. However, emerging scientific evidence suggests the involvement of additional membrane proteins, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Here, we report that syndecans, the evolutionarily conserved family of transmembrane proteoglycans, facilitate the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. Among syndecans, the lung abundant syndecan-4 was the most efficient in mediating SARS-CoV-2 uptake. The S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plays a dominant role in the virus’s interactions with syndecans. Besides the polyanionic heparan sulfate chains, other parts of the syndecan ectodomain, such as the cell-binding domain, also contribute to the interaction with SARS-CoV-2. During virus internalization, syndecans colocalize with ACE2, suggesting a jointly shared internalization pathway. Both ACE2 and syndecan inhibitors exhibited significant efficacy in reducing the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, thus supporting the complex nature of internalization.

We provide evidence that the nsp12-associated NiRAN domain has nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) transferase activity in trans and identified nsp9, an RNA-binding protein, as its target. NiRAN catalyzes the covalent attachment of an NMP moiety to the conserved nsp9 amino terminus in a reaction dependent on Mn2+ ions and an adjacent conserved Asn residue. NiRAN activity and nsp9 NMPylation were found to be essential for coronavirus replication. The data lead us to connect this activity of a nidovirus enzymatic marker with previous observations within a functionally and evolutionarily coherent hypothesis on the initiation of RNA synthesis in a class of RNA viruses. RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) of the Nidovirales (Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and 12 other families) are linked to an amino-terminal (N-terminal) domain, called NiRAN, in a nonstructural protein (nsp) that is released from polyprotein 1ab by the viral main protease (Mpro). Previously, self-GMPylation/UMPylation activities were reported for an arterivirus NiRAN-RdRp nsp and suggested to generate a transient state primed for transferring nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) to (currently unknown) viral and/or cellular biopolymers. Here, we show that the coronavirus (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) nsp12 (NiRAN-RdRp) has Mn2+-dependent NMPylation activity that catalyzes the transfer of a single NMP to the cognate nsp9 by forming a phosphoramidate bond with the primary amine at the nsp9 N terminus (N3825) following Mpro-mediated proteolytic release of nsp9 from N-terminally flanking nsps. Uridine triphosphate was the preferred nucleotide in this reaction, but also adenosine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, and cytidine triphosphate were suitable cosubstrates. Mutational studies using recombinant coronavirus nsp9 and nsp12 proteins and genetically engineered HCoV-229E mutants identified residues essential for NiRAN-mediated nsp9 NMPylation and virus replication in cell culture. The data corroborate predictions on NiRAN active-site residues and establish an essential role for the nsp9 N3826 residue in both nsp9 NMPylation in vitro and virus replication. This residue is part of a conserved N-terminal NNE tripeptide sequence and shown to be the only invariant residue in nsp9 and its homologs in viruses of the family Coronaviridae.

The virus-encoded non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) is a bi-functional enzyme consisting of an exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain and plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Here, we report the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN domain bound to its co-factor nsp10 and show that, compared to the SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14-full-length complex, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN retains an integral exoribonuclease fold and preserves an active configuration in the catalytic center. Analysis of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN interface reveals a footprint in nsp10 extensively overlapping with that observed in the nsp10/nsp16 structure. A marked difference in the co-factor when engaging nsp14 and nsp16 lies in helix-α1′, which is further experimentally ascertained to be involved in nsp14-binding but not in nsp16-engagement. Finally, we also show that nsp10/nsp14-ExoN is enzymatically active despite the absence of nsp14-MTase domain.

The therapy has been deemed safe, and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of ≥1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here, we performed repeated analyses at 1-month intervals on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that the levels of receptor-binding-domain (RBD)-specific IgG and IgA slightly decreased between 6 and 10 weeks after the onset of symptoms but that RBD-specific IgM levels decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S or its D614G variant.

To achieve this, SARS-CoV-2 deploys overlapping mechanisms to antagonize IFN production and signaling. The strongest IFN antagonist is the accessory protein ORF6, which localizes to multiple membranous compartments, including the nuclear envelope, where it directly binds nuclear pore components Nup98-Rae1 to inhibit nuclear translocation of activated STAT1/IRF3 transcription factors. However, this direct cause-and-effect relationship between ORF6 localization and IFN antagonism has yet to be explored experimentally. Here, we use extensive mutagenesis studies to define the structural determinants required for steady-state localization and demonstrate that mis-localized ORF6 variants still potently inhibit nuclear trafficking and IFN signaling.

ABSTRACT Pseudotyped viruses are valuable tools for studying virulent or lethal viral pathogens that need to be handled in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) or higher facilities. With the explosive spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the establishment of a BSL2 adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudovirus neutralization assay is needed to facilitate the development of countermeasures. Here, we describe an approach to generate a single-round lentiviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which produced a signal more than 2 logs above background. Specifically, a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant with a cytoplasmic tail deletion of 13 amino acids, termed SΔCT13, conferred enhanced spike incorporation into pseudovirions and increased viral entry into cells compared to that with full-length spike (S). We further compared S and SΔCT13 in terms of their sensitivity to vaccine sera, purified convalescent-phase IgG, human ACE2 (hACE2) murine IgG (mIgG), and the virus entry inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). We developed an SΔCT13-based pseudovirus neutralization assay and defined key assay characteristics, including linearity, limit of detection, and intra-assay and intermediate assay precision. Our data demonstrate that the SΔCT13-based pseudovirus shows enhanced infectivity in target cells, which will facilitate the assessment of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibody therapeutics, and vaccination. This pseudovirus neutralization assay can also be readily adapted to SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerge.

The leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ABSTRACT Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells. These findings are consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients.

IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a worldwide challenge for health care systems. The leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date, pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) have been largely overlooked as a therapeutic target in COVID-19, yet emerging evidence suggests that these cells contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering vessel barrier integrity, promoting a procoagulative state, inducing vascular inflammation and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a better mechanistic understanding of the vasculature is of utmost importance. In this study, we screened the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells and found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation.

Animal models demonstrating end-organ protection in C3-deficient mice and evidence of complement activation in humans have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 triggers complement-mediated endothelial damage, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (subunit 1 and 2), but not the N protein, directly activates the alternative pathway of complement (APC). Complement-dependent killing using the modified Ham test is blocked by either C5 or factor D inhibition. C3 fragments and C5b-9 are deposited on TF1PIGAnull target cells, and complement factor Bb is increased in the supernatant from spike protein–treated cells. C5 inhibition prevents the accumulation of C5b-9 on cells, but not C3c; however, factor D inhibition prevents both C3c and C5b-9 accumulation. Addition of factor H mitigates the complement attack. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins convert nonactivator surfaces to activator surfaces by preventing the inactivation of the cell-surface APC convertase.

ABSTRACT The spike protein (S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directs infection of the lungs and other tissues following its binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. For effective infection, the S protein is cleaved at two sites: S1/S2 and S2′.

In this study, for the first time we unambiguously identified by proteomics the fusion activation site S2′ as KPSKR815↓ (the underlined basic amino acids refer to critical residues needed for the furin recognition) and demonstrated that this cleavage was strongly enhanced by ACE2 engagement with the S protein. Novel pharmacological furin inhibitors (BOS inhibitors) effectively blocked endogenous S protein processing at both sites in HeLa cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung-derived Calu-3 cells was completely prevented by combined inhibitors of furin (BOS) and type II transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (camostat). Quantitative analyses of cell-to-cell fusion and S protein processing revealed that ACE2 shedding by TMPRSS2 was required for TMPRSS2-mediated enhancement of fusion in the absence of S1/S2 priming. We further demonstrated that the collectrin dimerization domain of ACE2 was essential for the effect of TMPRSS2 on cell-to-cell fusion. Overall, our results indicate that furin and TMPRSS2 act synergistically in viral entry and infectivity, supporting the combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has so far resulted in >6.1 million deaths worldwide. The spike protein (S) of the virus directs infection of the lungs and other tissues by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. For effective infection, the S protein is cleaved at two sites: S1/S2 and S2′. Cleavage at S1/S2 induces a conformational change favoring the S protein recognition by ACE2. The S2′ cleavage is critical for triggering membrane fusion and virus entry into host cells. Our study highlights the complex dynamics of interaction between the S protein, ACE2, and the host proteases furin and TMPRSS2 during SARS-CoV-2 entry and suggests that the combination of a nontoxic furin inhibitor with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor significantly reduces viral entry in lung cells, as evidenced by an average synergistic ∼95% reduction of viral infection. This represents a powerful novel antiviral approach to reduce viral spread in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 or future related coronaviruses.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that the combination of a nontoxic furin inhibitor with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor significantly reduces viral entry in lung cells, as evidenced by an average synergistic ∼95% reduction of viral infection."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":185,"details":{"paperId":"654c032aa47076354e94766be1841110d29f7b1d","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8588607","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167357","CorpusId":"244042280","PubMed":"34780781"},"title":"Disulfide Bonds Play a Critical Role in the Structure and Function of the Receptor-binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Antigen","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The research demonstrates the mechanism by which the disulfide bonds contribute to the molecular structure of the RBD of the Spike protein, allowing the R BD to execute its viral function."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":367,"details":{"paperId":"e1636d2f0721d4b6a3c4c3fac05593e2c6a8bb4e","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03491-6","CorpusId":"233185118","PubMed":"33827113"},"title":"Drugs that inhibit TMEM16 proteins block SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced syncytia","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Lungs from patients who died from COVID-19 show atypical fused cells, the formation of which is mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and drugs that inhibit TMEM16F can prevent spike-induced syncytia formation."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":68,"details":{"paperId":"9cee86b075ccec62c051538188bddc2ec4e133f5","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7678427","MAG":"3100742261","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.060","CorpusId":"227070035","PubMed":"33276951"},"title":"Dual ELISA using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein produced in E. coli and CHO cells reveals epitope masking by N-glycosylation","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that the glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2-NP masks some of its antibody epitopes, which can lead to false-negative serological tests."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":57,"details":{"paperId":"026fecde9ded5672fd3afc307a3e88f181f19581","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7839511","DOI":"10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105020","CorpusId":"231721433","PubMed":"33515606"},"title":"Dual inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and human rhinovirus with protease inhibitors in clinical development","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Structural analysis showed that the combination of minimal interactions, conformational flexibility, and limited bulk allows GC376 and calpain inhibitor II to potently inhibit both enzymes, which can guide the design of cysteine protease inhibitors that are either virus-specific or retain a broad antiviral spectrum against coronaviruses and rhinoviruses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":417,"details":{"paperId":"cd296c982be3d7f209001be40fc7443cc6b469be","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8017934","MAG":"3080662727","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2017715118","CorpusId":"221276378","PubMed":"33479166"},"title":"Dynamic competition between SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and mRNA on the human ribosome inhibits translation initiation","abstract":"Significance SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of translation initiation is an important target for future studies. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta-CoV that recently emerged as a human pathogen and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. We demonstrate biochemically that NSP1 inhibits translation of model human and SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs). NSP1 specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1–40S subunit binding in real time, we determine that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) allosterically modulate the interaction of NSP1 with ribosomal preinitiation complexes in the absence of mRNA. We further elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 proteins from viruses in at least two subgenera of beta-CoVs associate with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A model where NSP1 proteins from viruses in at least two subgenera of beta-CoVs associate with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel is supported."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":520,"details":{"paperId":"f453ef1a5a19ce6db711c151dba87c77afb5c5c5","externalIds":{"MAG":"3080467409","DOI":"10.1101/2020.08.24.264465","CorpusId":"221355713"},"title":"Dynamics of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein drives dsRNA melting in a counterintuitive tweezer-like mechanism","abstract":"The N protein of betacoronaviruses is responsible for nucleocapsid assembly and other essential regulatory functions. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs’ Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of β2-β3 and 2-β5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are among the largest positive-sense RNA viruses. They display a unique discontinous transcription mechanism, involving N protein as a major player. The N-NTD promote the dsRNA melting releasing the nascent sense negative strand via a poorly known mechanism of action. It specifically recognizes the body TRS conserved RNA motif located at the 5’ end of each ORF. N protein has the ability to transfer the nascent RNA strand to the leader TRS. The mechanism is essential and one single mutation at the RNA binding site of the N-NTD impairs the viral replication.

On the 16th of May around 4.5 million people got infected and over 300,000 died due to the infection of COV2. The effective treatment remains a challenge. Targeted therapeutics are still under investigation. The papain-like protease (PLPro) from the human SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a cysteine protease that plays a critical role in virus replication. Its activity is required to process the viral polyprotein into functional, mature subunits. Moreover, COV2 uses this enzyme to modulate the host’s immune system to its own benefit. Therefore, it represents a highly promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. In this work, we discovered that ebselen, a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective activity in mammalian cells and cytotoxicity in lower organisms, is a highly active inhibitor of PLProCoV2. We proved that ebselen is a covalent, fast-binding inhibitor of PLProCoV2 exhibiting a low micromolar potency. Furthermore, we identified a difference between PLPro from SARS-CoV-1 (the corona virus which caused the 2002–2004 outbreak, SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 that allows to explain the difference in dynamics of the replication, and, thus, the disease progression. Namely, we present that they show differences in the binding affinity of substrates that we observed through kinetics and molecular docking studies. Using a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation method we were able to find kinetic constants for both enzymes. Molecular modeling study on the structure of the active site and binding mode of the ebselen with SARS and COV2 showed also significant differences that could explain our observation that ebselen is less active and slower bounding with SARS than COV2.

We here focus on the S2’ motif which, during virus entry, requires cleavage by a cell surface protease to release the fusion peptide. Though belonging to an immunogenic region, the SARS-CoV-2 S2’ motif (811-KPSKR-815) has shown hardly any variation, with its three basic (K/R) residues being >99.99% conserved thus far. By creating a series of mutant S-pseudotyped viruses, we show that K814, which precedes the scissile R815 residue, is dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 spike activation by TMPRSS2 but not TMPRSS13. The latter protease lost its activity towards SARS-CoV-2 S when the S2’ motif was swapped with that of the low pathogenic 229E coronavirus (685-RVAGR-689) and also the reverse effect was seen. This swap had no impact on TMPRSS2 activation. Also in the MERS-CoV spike, introducing a dibasic scissile motif was fully accepted by TMPRSS13 but less so by TMPRSS2. Our findings are the first to demonstrate which S2’ residues are important for SARS-CoV-2 spike activation by these two airway proteases, with TMPRSS13 exhibiting higher preference for K/R rich motifs than TMPRSS2. This preemptive insight can help to estimate the impact of S2’ motif changes as they may appear in new SARS-CoV-2 variants. IMPORTANCE Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing worldwide selection with frequent appearance of new variants. The surveillance would benefit from proactive characterization of the functional motifs in the spike protein, the most variable viral factor. This is linked to immune evasion but also influences spike functioning in a direct manner. Remarkably, though located in a strong immunogenic region, the S2’ cleavage motif has, thus far, remained highly conserved. This suggests that its amino acid sequence is critical for spike activation by airway proteases. To investigate this, we assessed which S2’ site mutations affect processing by TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS13, two main activators of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Being the first in its kind, our study will help to assess the biological impact of S2’ site variations as soon as they are detected during variant surveillance.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"These findings are the first to demonstrate which S2’ residues are important for SARS-CoV-2 spike activation by these two airway proteases, with TMPR SS13 exhibiting higher preference for K/R rich motifs than TMPRSS2."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":662,"details":{"paperId":"4a72488716ffc44a4913d87265899aa61265dd8c","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1186/s12967-020-02507-5","CorpusId":"255954912"},"title":"Emerging of a SARS-CoV-2 viral strain with a deletion in nsp1","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The deletion that is described indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing profound genomic changes and could affect the structure of the C-terminal region of the protein, important for regulation of viral replication and negative effect on host’s gene expression."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":395,"details":{"paperId":"791883254f939a4050e1cfaff2eec6b712d2b4f1","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8190434","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-91231-1","CorpusId":"235393868","PubMed":"34108510"},"title":"Endothelial glycocalyx shields the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 receptors","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that primary human pulmonary artery ECs possess ACE2 capable of interaction with the viral Spike protein (S-protein) and the crucial role of the endothelial glycocalyx in the regulation of the S-protein binding to ACE2 on ECs is demonstrated."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":154,"details":{"paperId":"bdb5ae284d7cee67d28c778ecd27d65785e263b2","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8103780","DOI":"10.1016/j.isci.2021.102523","CorpusId":"233986740","PubMed":"33997662"},"title":"Energetic and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein co-assemblies with nucleic acids","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Biophysical tools are used to study N-protein interactions with oligonucleotides of different length, examining the size, composition, secondary structure, and energetics of the resulting states, and observe formation of supramolecular clusters or nuclei preceding growth into phase-separated droplets."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":227,"details":{"paperId":"d950ef8c6fcc6392a48ec338061aa7c0c0923c30","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7885803","DOI":"10.1021/acs.biochem.1c00046","CorpusId":"231666915","PubMed":"33569952"},"title":"Enhanced Cholesterol-Dependent Hemifusion by Internal Fusion Peptide 1 of SARS Coronavirus-2 Compared to Its N-Terminal Counterpart","abstract":"Membrane fusion is an important step for the entry of the lipid-sheathed viruses into the host cells.

The E-CTD was also found to display conformational changes with osmolytes. Furthermore, prolonged incubation of the E-CTD under physiological conditions resulted in amyloid-like fibril formation.

How sequence variations in the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome affect pathogenicity is poorly understood. Starting in October 2020, using the methodology of genome‐wide association studies (GWAS), we looked at the association between whole‐genome sequencing (WGS) data of the virus and COVID‐19 mortality as a potential method of early identification of highly pathogenic strains to target for containment. Although continuously updating our analysis, in December 2020, we analyzed 7548 single‐stranded SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes of COVID‐19 patients in the GISAID database and associated variants with mortality using a logistic regression. In total, evaluating 29,891 sequenced loci of the viral genome for association with patient/host mortality, two loci, at 12,053 and 25,088 bp, achieved genome‐wide significance (p values of 4.09e−09 and 4.41e−23, respectively), though only 25,088 bp remained significant in follow‐up analyses. Our association findings were exclusively driven by the samples that were submitted from Brazil (p value of 4.90e−13 for 25,088 bp). The mutation frequency of 25,088 bp in the Brazilian samples on GISAID has rapidly increased from about 0.4 in October/December 2020 to 0.77 in March 2021. Although GWAS methodology is suitable for samples in which mutation frequencies varies between geographical regions, it cannot account for mutation frequencies that change rapidly overtime, rendering a GWAS follow‐up analysis of the GISAID samples that have been submitted after December 2020 as invalid. The locus at 25,088 bp is located in the P.1 strain, which later (April 2021) became one of the distinguishing loci (precisely, substitution V1176F) of the Brazilian strain as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Specifically, the mutations at 25,088 bp occur in the S2 subunit of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, which plays a key role in viral entry of target host cells. Since the mutations alter amino acid coding sequences, they potentially imposing structural changes that could enhance viral infectivity and symptom severity. Our analysis suggests that GWAS methodology can provide suitable analysis tools for the real‐time detection of new more transmissible and pathogenic viral strains in databases such as GISAID, though new approaches are needed to accommodate rapidly changing mutation frequencies over time, in the presence of simultaneously changing case/control ratios.

Following initial infection of airway epithelia, SARS-CoV-2 invades a wide range of cells in multiple organs, including pancreatic islet cells. Diabetes is now recognized as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalisation and death. Additionally, COVID-19 is associated with higher risk of new-onset diabetes and metabolic complications of diabetes. One mechanism by which these deleterious outcomes may occur is via destruction of insulin-producing islet β cells, either directly by SARS-CoV-2 entry into β cells or indirectly due to inflammation and fibrosis in the surrounding microenvironment. While the canonical pathway of viral entry via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been established as a major route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung, it may not be solely responsible for viral entry into the endocrine pancreas. This is likely due to divergent expression of viral entry factors amongst different tissues. For example, expression of ACE2 has not been unequivocally demonstrated in β cells. Thus, it is important to understand how other proteins known to be highly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, with the view that these could be targeted to prevent demise of the β cell in COVID-19. To that end, this review discusses alternate receptors of SARS-CoV-2 (CD147 and GRP78), as well as mediators (furin, TMPRSS2, cathepsin L, ADAM17, neuropilin-1 and heparan sulphate) that may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into pancreatic islets independent of or in conjunction with ACE2.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is important to understand how other proteins known to be highly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, with the view that these could be targeted to prevent demise of the β cell in COVID-19."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":196,"details":{"paperId":"f8f49b1543ba09063af66e59797ea89e867b0be3","externalIds":{"MAG":"3047880613","PubMedCentral":"7418786","DOI":"10.1016/j.molcel.2020.08.006","CorpusId":"218686960","PubMed":"32877642"},"title":"Growth Factor Receptor Signaling Inhibition Prevents SARS-CoV-2 Replication","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"GFR signaling is revealed as central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication, providing with novel strategies for COVID-19 treatment and revealing GFR signaling as key pathway targetable by approved drugs."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":589,"details":{"paperId":"675ef9bba27bc85596e01d6b21399f5fb89dd49b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7929516","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.abf1004","CorpusId":"232112716","PubMed":"33658206"},"title":"Hallmarks of Alpha- and Betacoronavirus non-structural protein 7+8 complexes","abstract":"Coronaviral nsp7+8 complexes follow species- and stoichiometry-specific assembly pathways determined by few amino acid changes.

Heparin, a widely used anticoagulant drug, is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy. Exogenous heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses, including S-associated coronavirus isolate HSR1. Here, we show that heparin inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) invasion of Vero cells by up to 80% at doses achievable through prophylaxis and, particularly relevant, within the range deliverable by nebulisation. Surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that heparin and enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin which is a clinical anticoagulant, bind and induce a conformational change in the spike (S1) protein receptor-binding domain (S1 RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. A library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments were used to probe the structural basis of this interaction. Binding to the RBD is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulfate groups than on N-sulfation and a hexasaccharide is the minimum size required for secondary structural changes to be induced in the RBD. It is likely that inhibition of viral infection arises from an overlap between the binding sites of heparin/HS on S1 RBD and that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

Interestingly, average glycan masses determined by \"top-down\" CDMS measurements are 35-47% larger than those obtained from the \"bottom-up\" glycoproteomics studies, suggesting that the glycoproteomic measurements underestimated the abundances of larger, more-complex glycans. Moreover, the distribution of glycan masses determined by CDMS is much broader than the distribution expected from the glycoproteomics studies, assuming that glycan processing on each trimer is not correlated.

Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA capping The development of antiviral drugs that impair SARS-CoV-2 replication or prevent it from evading the host immune system is critical for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The methyltransferase that caps viral mRNAs is a potential target for antiviral therapies because capping both enhances the translation of viral proteins and prevents viral mRNAs from being recognized by the host immune system. Rosas-Lemus et al. solved crystal structures for the SARS-CoV-2 methyltransferase, the nsp16-nsp10 heterodimer, in complex with various combinations of its methyl donor and cap structure substrates, a reaction product, and an inhibitor.

There are currently no antiviral therapies specific for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic disease COVID-19.

The findings indicated that S2 subunit (heptad-repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), and connector domain (CD) domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity.

ABSTRACT Severe cardiovascular complications can occur in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in spontaneously beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor but not the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that mediates spike protein cleavage in the lungs. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-CMs was prolific; viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CMs, smooth-walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65- to 90-nm particles with canonical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads in hiPSC-CMs, we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm cell-to-cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin and furin-like proteases abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that disrupts the multibasic furin cleavage motif was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in hiPSC-CMs and furin, and/or furin-like-protease activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform enables target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Cardiac complications frequently observed in COVID-19 patients are tentatively attributed to systemic inflammation and thrombosis, but viral replication has occasionally been confirmed in cardiac tissue autopsy materials. We developed an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 spread in myocardium using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. In these highly differentiated cells, viral transcription levels exceeded those previously documented in permissive transformed cell lines. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread, we expressed a fluorescent version of its spike protein that allowed us to characterize a fusion-based cytopathic effect. A mutant of the spike protein with a single amino acid mutation in the furin/furin-like protease cleavage site lost cytopathic function. Of note, the fusion activities of the spike protein of other coronaviruses correlated with the level of cardiovascular complications observed in infections with the respective viruses.

COVID-19 patient symptoms range from life-threatening to mild and asymptomatic, which presents unique problems in identifying, quarantining, and treating the affected individuals. The emergence of unusual symptoms among survivors, now referred to as “Long COVID”, is concerning, especially since much about the condition and the treatment of it is still relatively unknown. Evidence so far also suggests that some of these symptoms can be attributed to vascular inflammation. Although famotidine, the commonly used histamine H2 receptor (H2R) blocker, was shown to have no antiviral activity, recent reports indicate that it could prevent adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Histamine is a classic proinflammatory mediator, the levels of which increase along with other cytokines during COVID-19 infection. Histamine activates H2R signaling, while famotidine specifically blocks H2R activation. Investigating the effects of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 Receptor-Binding Domain (Spike) on ACE2 expression in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells, we found that the presence of histamine potentiated spike-mediated ACE2 internalization into endothelial cells. This effect was blocked by famotidine, protein kinase A inhibition, or by H2 receptor protein knockdown.

The interferon (IFN) response is the main antiviral component of human innate immunity and is actively suppressed by several non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, allowing viral replication within human cells. Differences in IFN signalling efficiency and timing have emerged as central determinants of the variability of COVID-19 disease severity between patients, highlighting the need for an improved understanding of host–pathogen interactions that affect the IFN response. ADP-ribosylation is an underexplored post-translational modification catalyzed by ADP-ribosyl transferases collectively termed poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). Several human PARPs are induced by the IFN response and participate in antiviral defences by regulating IFN signalling itself, modulating host processes such as translation and protein trafficking, as well as directly modifying and inhibiting viral target proteins. SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses encode a macrodomain that hydrolyzes ADP-ribose modifications, thus counteracting antiviral PARP activity.

CoVs rely on host cell proteases for activation and infection. The trypsin-like protease TMPRSS2 at the cell surface, cathepsin L in endolysosomes, and furin in the Golgi have all been implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 proteolytic processing. Whether SARS-CoV-2 depends on endocytosis internalization and vacuolar acidification for infectious entry remains unclear. Here, we examined the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 activation during the cell entry process in tissue culture. Using four cell lines representative of lung, colon, and kidney epithelial tissues, we found that TMPRSS2 determines the SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways. In TMPRSS2-positive cells, infection was sensitive to aprotinin, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, but not to SB412515, a drug that impairs cathepsin L. Infectious penetration was marginally dependent on endosomal acidification, and the virus passed the protease-sensitive step within 10 min. In a marked contrast, in TMPRSS2-negative cells cathepsin L and low pH were required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The cathepsin L-activated penetration occurred within 40-60 min after internalization and required intact endolysosomal functions. Importantly, pre-activation of the virus allowed it to bypass the need for endosomal acidification for viral fusion and productive entry. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other CoVs a strategy of differential use of host cell proteases for activation and infectious penetration. This study also highlights the importance of TMPRSS2 in dictating the entry pathway used by SARS-CoV-2. Significance Preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread requires approaches affecting early virus-host cell interactions before the virus enters and infects target cells. Host cell proteases are critical for coronavirus activation and infectious entry. Here, we reconcile apparent contradictory observations from recent reports on endosomal acidification and the role of furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L in the productive entry and fusion process of SARS-CoV-2. Investigating authentic virus in various cell types, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 developed the ability to use different entry pathways, depending on the proteases expressed by the target cell. Our results have strong implications for future research on the apparent broad tropism of the virus in vivo.

To regulate and maintain such a large viral RNA genome, host RNA helicases may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the largest RNA genome, approximately 30 kb, among RNA viruses. The DDX DEAD box RNA helicase is a multifunctional protein involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism. Therefore, host RNA helicases may regulate and maintain such a large viral RNA genome. In this study, I investigated the potential role of several host cellular RNA helicases in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, DDX21 knockdown markedly accumulated intracellular viral RNA and viral production, as well as viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that DDX21 strongly restricts the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, MOV10 RNA helicase also suppressed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, DDX1, DDX5, and DDX6 RNA helicases were required for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection dispersed the P-body formation of DDX6 and MOV10 RNA helicases as well as XRN1 exonuclease, while the viral infection did not induce stress granule formation. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein interacted with DDX1, DDX3, DDX5, DDX6, DDX21, and MOV10 and disrupted the P-body formation, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 N hijacks DDX6 to carry out viral replication. Conversely, DDX21 and MOV10 restricted SARS-CoV-2 infection through an interaction of SARS-CoV-2 N with host cellular RNA helicases. Altogether, host cellular RNA helicases seem to regulate the SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 has a large RNA genome, of approximately 30 kb. To regulate and maintain such a large viral RNA genome, host RNA helicases may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication. In this study, I have demonstrated that DDX21 and MOV10 RNA helicases limit viral infection and replication. In contrast, DDX1, DDX5, and DDX6 are required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Data mining of viral-infection-related RNA-sequencing data has resulted in the identification of 28 754, 720 and 3437 circRNAs encoded by MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. MERS-CoV exhibits much more prominent ability to encode circRNAs in all genomic regions than those of SARS-CoV-1/2. Viral circRNAs typically exhibit low expression levels. Moreover, majority of the viral circRNAs exhibit expressions only in the late stage of viral infection.

While most mutations do not make significant contributions to viral molecular evolution, some are naturally selected and produce variants through positive selection. ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that is continuously evolving. Although its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase exhibits some exonuclease proofreading activity, viral sequence diversity can be produced by replication errors and host factors. A diversity of genetic variants can be observed in the intrahost viral population structure of infected individuals. Most mutations will follow a neutral molecular evolution and will not make significant contributions to variations within and between infected hosts. Herein, we profiled the intrasample genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants, also known as quasispecies, using high-throughput sequencing data sets from 15,289 infected individuals and infected cell lines. Despite high mutational background, we identified recurrent intragenetic variable positions in the samples analyzed, including several positions at the end of the gene encoding the viral spike (S) protein. Strikingly, we observed a high frequency of C→A missense mutations resulting in the S protein lacking the last 20 amino acids (SΔ20). We found that this truncated S protein undergoes increased processing and increased syncytium formation, presumably due to escaping M protein retention in intracellular compartments. Our findings suggest the emergence of a high-frequency viral sublineage that is not horizontally transmitted but potentially involved in intrahost disease cytopathic effects. IMPORTANCE The mutation rate and evolution of RNA viruses correlate with viral adaptation. While most mutations do not make significant contributions to viral molecular evolution, some are naturally selected and produce variants through positive selection. Many SARS-CoV-2 variants have been recently described and show phenotypic selection toward more infectious viruses. Our study describes another type of variant that does not contribute to interhost heterogeneity but rather phenotypic selection toward variants that might have increased cytopathic effects.

SARS-CoV-2 uses two distinct entry pathways: 1) a surface, serine protease-dependent or 2) an endosomal, cysteine protease-dependent pathway. In investigating serine protease-independent cell-cell fusion, we found that the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP2/9, can activate SARS-CoV-2 S fusion activity, but not that of SARS-CoV-1. Importantly, metalloproteinase activation of SARS-CoV-2 S represents a third entry pathway in cells expressing high MMP levels.

SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory disease and death in humans, highlighting the need for effective antiviral therapies. The RNA synthesis machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an ideal drug target and consists of non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), which is directly responsible for RNA synthesis, and numerous co-factors that are involved in RNA proofreading and 5’ capping of viral mRNAs. The formation of the 5’ cap-1 structure is known to require a guanylyltransferase (GTase) as well as 5’ triphosphatase and methyltransferase activities. However, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA capping remains poorly understood. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase nsp12 functions as a GTase. We characterise this GTase activity and find that the nsp12 NiRAN (nidovirus RdRP-associated nucleotidyltransferase) domain is responsible for carrying out the addition of a GTP nucleotide to the 5’ end of viral RNA via a 5’ to 5’ triphosphate linkage.

Understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is still in its infancy. A 382-nt deletion strain lacking ORF8 (Δ382 herein) was isolated in Singapore in March 2020. Infection with Δ382 was associated with less severe disease in patients, compared to infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Here, we established Nasal Epithelial cells (NECs) differentiated from healthy nasal-tissue derived stem cells as a suitable model for the ex-vivo study of SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathogenesis. Infection of NECs with either SARS-CoV-2 or Δ382 resulted in virus particles released exclusively from the apical side, with similar replication kinetics. Screening of a panel of 49 cytokines for basolateral secretion from infected NECs identified CXCL10 as the only cytokine significantly induced upon infection, at comparable levels in both wild-type and Δ382 infected cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed the temporal up-regulation of distinct gene subsets during infection, with anti-viral signaling pathways only detected at late time-points (72 hours post-infection, hpi). This immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was significantly attenuated when compared to infection with an influenza strain, H3N2, which elicited an inflammatory response within 8 hpi, and a greater magnitude of anti-viral gene up-regulation at late time-points. Remarkably, Δ382 induced a host transcriptional response nearly identical to that of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 at every post-infection time-point examined.

Spike proteins are heavily modified with several N-glycans, which are predicted to modulate their function. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) extensively N-glycosylates its spike proteins, which are necessary for host cell invasion and the target of both vaccines and immunotherapies. These N-glycans are predicted to modulate spike binding to the host receptor by stabilizing its open conformation and host immunity evasion. Here, we investigated the essentiality of both the host N-glycosylation pathway and SARS-CoV-2 N-glycans for infection. Ablation of host N-glycosylation using RNA interference or inhibitors, including FDA-approved drugs, reduced the spread of the infection, including that of variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Under these conditions, cells produced fewer virions and some completely lost their infectivity. Furthermore, partial enzymatic deglycosylation of intact virions showed that surface-exposed N-glycans are critical for cell invasion. Altogether, we propose protein N-glycosylation as a targetable pathway with clinical potential for treatment of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike surface proteins to infect human cells.

Furthermore, ACE2 cannot easily interpret the multi-organ tropisms of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To identify host cell receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 interactions, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen almost all human membrane proteins, with SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein as the target.

The envelope (E) protein, one of four structural proteins encoded in the viral genome, is a 75-residue integral membrane protein whose transmembrane domain exhibits ion channel activity and whose cytoplasmic domain participates in protein-protein interactions. These activities contribute to several aspects of the viral replication-cycle, including virion assembly, budding, release, and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the structure and dynamics of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in hexadecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy. We also characterized its interactions with four putative ion channel inhibitors. The chemical shift index and dipolar wave plots establish that E protein consists of a long transmembrane helix (residues 8-43) and a short cytoplasmic helix (residues 53-60) connected by a complex linker that exhibits some internal mobility. The conformations of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain are unaffected by truncation from the intact protein. The chemical shift perturbations of E protein spectra induced by the addition of the inhibitors demonstrate that the N-terminal region (residues 6-18) is the principal binding site. The binding affinity of the inhibitors to E protein in micelles correlates with their antiviral potency in Vero E6 cells: HMA ≈ EIPA > DMA >> Amiloride, suggesting that bulky hydrophobic groups in the 5’ position of the amiloride pyrazine ring play essential roles in binding to E protein and in antiviral activity. An N15A mutation increased the production of virus-like particles, induced significant chemical shift changes from residues in the inhibitor binding site, and abolished HMA binding, suggesting that Asn15 plays a key role in maintaining the protein conformation near the binding site. These studies provide the foundation for complete structure determination of E protein and for structure-based drug discovery targeting this protein. Author Summary The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the world-wide pandemic of COVID-19, has become one of the greatest threats to human health. While rapid progress has been made in the development of vaccines, drug discovery has lagged, partly due to the lack of atomic-resolution structures of the free and drug-bound forms of the viral proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein, with its multiple activities that contribute to viral replication, is widely regarded as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. As structural information is essential for drug discovery, we established an efficient sample preparation system for biochemical and structural studies of intact full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein and characterized its structure and dynamics. We also characterized the interactions of amilorides with specific E protein residues and correlated this with their antiviral activity during viral replication. The binding affinity of the amilorides to E protein correlated with their antiviral potency, suggesting that E protein is indeed the likely target of their antiviral activity.

As of late September 2021, over 231 million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide. Although the viral pathogenesis remains largely unclear, impairment of interferon (IFN) responses likely contributes to disease progression and severity (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Meffre and Iwasaki, 2020; Min et al., 2021). Indeed, several viral proteins are potential regulators of the IFN system (Min et al., 2021). However, the underlying mechanisms employed by SARS-CoV-2 IFN antagonist candidates, such as nonstructural protein 13 (NSP13), still need to be determined. NSP13 is important in viral replication as a helicase unwinding duplex RNA and a 50-triphosphatase likely involved in 50-capping of viral mRNA (Min et al., 2021). We observed robust inhibition of type I IFN signaling by SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 through reporter gene assays (Figure 1A), consistent with previous observations (Lei et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020; Yuen et al., 2020), highlighting the versatile activities of NSP13 in viral infection. Furthermore, NSP13 inhibition of type I IFN signaling was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of the induction of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Supplementary Figure S1A). Although Gordon et al. (2020) recently reported possible host molecules interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, none of the 40 cellular proteins identified with NSP13 as bait are involved in IFN-triggered signaling pathways. Additionally, time-sensitive preparation of the manuscript precluded visual results (immunoblotting or silver staining) demonstrating effective precipitation of baits and cellular proteins before mass spectrometry (MS) (Gordon et al., 2020). Thus, further exploration of the viral interactome is worthwhile. To elucidate the mechanism of NSP13-mediated IFN signaling antagonism and further decipher the potential cellular interaction landscape of such an important viral protein, we exploited a high-affinity purification assay (Spulldown) coupled with quantitative MS to identify the cellular interactome of NSP13 (Figure 1B). S-tagged NSP13 expressed in cells was efficiently precipitated, and bands of cellular proteins co-precipitating with NSP13 were also evident (Figure 1C and D). MS analysis identified 172 cellular proteins as potential NSP13-interacting host factors with high confidence (Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S2A); 171 were newly identified in this study (C1orf50 was also reported by Gordon et al., 2020). These proteins might affect NSP13 function or be affected by NSP13. We next validated the interactions of NSP13 with a series of representative host proteins through immunoblotting (Supplementary Figure S3), further supporting the new interactome. Gene ontology and protein–protein interaction network analyses showed that these host proteins were enriched in several important biological processes and some specific molecular functions and cellular components (Figure 1E and F; Supplementary Figure S2D and E), highlighting novel and possibly significant aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology. For instance, enrichment of NSP13interacting proteins in regulation of mRNA stability might be linked to the role of NSP13 in viral mRNA capping. Interactions of NSP13 with host proteins involved in IL-1 signaling and MHC-I antigen presentation may modulate these pivotal inflammatory and immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intriguingly, the NSP13 interactome was enriched in proteins associated with transcriptional regulation in response to hypoxia (a pivotal and concerning pathophysiological feature of COVID-19 pneumonia; Kashani, 2020), indicating novel potential roles of NSP13 in COVID19 pathogenesis that merit future exploration. Furthermore, we identified 45 pharmacological cellular targets along with 95 corresponding drugs by drug database mining with the interactome (Figure 1G; Supplementary Table S2), revealing potentially valuable clues for future design of a NSP13–host interfacedirected intervention strategy. Importantly, an essential component of the IFN-triggered signaling pathway, STAT1 (Najjar and Fagard, 2010), was identified as a potential NSP13interacting protein (Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S2A–C).

We detected viral proteins in the context of the ultrastructure of infected cells and tissues and discovered that some viral proteins accumulate in novel, lipid-filled compartments. ABSTRACT The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global outbreak and prompted an enormous research effort. Still, the subcellular localization of the coronavirus in lungs of COVID-19 patients is not well understood. Here, the localization of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins is studied in postmortem lung material of COVID-19 patients and in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, processed identically. Correlative light and electron microscopy on semithick cryo-sections demonstrated induction of electron-lucent, lipid-filled compartments after SARS-CoV-2 infection in both lung and cell cultures. In lung tissue, the nonstructural protein 4 and the stable nucleocapsid N-protein were detected on these novel lipid-filled compartments. The induction of such lipid-filled compartments and the localization of the viral proteins in lung of patients with fatal COVID-19 may explain the extensive inflammatory response and provide a new hallmark for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the final, fatal stage of infection. IMPORTANCE Visualization of the subcellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in lung patient material of COVID-19 patients is important for the understanding of this new virus. We detected viral proteins in the context of the ultrastructure of infected cells and tissues and discovered that some viral proteins accumulate in novel, lipid-filled compartments. These structures are induced in Vero cells but, more importantly, also in lung of patients with COVID-19.

The methodology applies to any protein but it is developed with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a timely example.

Then, the expected outcome of a substitution mutation is estimated for a general class of hot-spots, by a comparative analysis of the backbone segments that surround the hot-spot sites. This analysis employs the statistics of commensurable amino acid fragments in the Protein Data Bank, in combination with general stereochemical considerations. It is observed that the notorious D614G substitution of the spike protein is a good example of such a mutation hot-spot. Several topologically similar examples are then analyzed in detail, some of them are even better candidates for a mutation hot-spot than D614G.

Some of these viral adaptations may alter not only the infectivity but also viral pathogenesis. Continuous phylogenomic analysis of circulating viral strains and functional investigation of new non-synonymous substitutions may help to understand the evolution of virus, its virulence and transmissibility. Here we describe a loss of an accessory protein orf3b (57 amino acids) in current circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, contributing around 24% of more than 100,000 complete viral genomes analysed. The loss of 3b is caused by the presence of an early stop codon which is created by an orf3a Q57H substitution. There is an increasing trend in the loss of orf3b which has reached 32% in May 2020. Geographically, loss of 3b is more prevalent in certain countries including Colombia (46%), USA (48%), South Korea (51%), France (66%), Saudi Arabia (72%), Finland (76%) and Egypt (77%). Interestingly, the loss of 3b coincides with the emergence of spike D614G substitution. In addition, we found that truncated orf3b has lost the interferon antagonism compared to the full-length orf3b, suggesting a loss of function by the newly adapted virus.

Knowledge of virus-host interactions and viral subversion mechanisms of host pathways is required for the development of effective countermeasures against CoVs. ABSTRACT Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emergent pathogens that may cause life-threatening respiratory diseases in humans. Understanding of CoV-host interactions may help to identify novel therapeutic targets. MOV10 is an RNA helicase involved in different steps of cellular RNA metabolism. Both MOV10 antiviral and proviral activities have been described in a limited number of viruses, but this protein has not been previously associated with CoVs. We found that during Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, MOV10 aggregated in cytoplasmic structures colocalizing with viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. MOV10-N interaction was confirmed by endogenous MOV10 coimmunoprecipitation, and the presence of other cellular proteins was also detected in MOV10 complexes. MOV10 silencing significantly increased both N protein accumulation and virus titer, with no changes in the accumulation of viral RNAs. Moreover, MOV10 overexpression caused a 10-fold decrease in viral titers. These data indicated that MOV10 has antiviral activity during MERS-CoV infection. We postulated that this activity could be mediated by viral RNA sequestration, and in fact, RNA immunoprecipitation data showed the presence of viral RNAs in the MOV10 cytoplasmic complexes. Expression of wild-type MOV10 or of a MOV10 mutant without helicase activity in MOV10 knockout cell lines, developed by CRISPR-Cas technology, indicated that the helicase activity of MOV10 was required for its antiviral effect. Interestingly MOV10-N interaction was conserved in other mildly or highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), although MOV10 antiviral activity was found only in highly pathogenic CoVs, suggesting a potential role of MOV10 in the modulation of human CoVs pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emerging pathogens causing life-threatening diseases in humans. Knowledge of virus-host interactions and viral subversion mechanisms of host pathways is required for the development of effective countermeasures against CoVs. The interaction between cellular RNA helicase MOV10 and nucleocapsid (N) protein from several human CoVs is shown. Using MERS-CoV as a model, we demonstrate that MOV10 has antiviral function, requiring its helicase activity, most likely mediated by viral RNA sequestration in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein structures. Furthermore, we found that MOV10 antiviral activity may act only in highly pathogenic human CoVs, suggesting a role for MOV10 in modulating CoVs pathogenesis.

In our recent study, we systematically analyzed the impact of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins on autophagy. We showed that E, M, ORF3a, and ORF7a cause an accumulation of autophagosomes, whereas Nsp15 prevents the efficient formation of autophagosomes. Consequently, autophagic degradation of SQSTM1/p62 is decreased in the presence of E, ORF3a, ORF7a, and Nsp15. Notably, M does not alter SQSTM1 protein levels and colocalizes with accumulations of LC3B-positive membranes not resembling vesicles. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 prevents SQSTM1 degradation and increases lipidation of LC3B, indicating overall that the infection causes a reduction of autophagic flux. Our mechanistic analyses showed that the accessory proteins ORF3a and ORF7a both block autophagic degradation but use different strategies. While ORF3a prevents the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, ORF7a reduces the acidity of lysosomes.

Furthermore, our hypothesis is consistent with the fact that RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 selects RMP for incorporation over AMP by 3-fold in vitro, and that RMP-added RNA can be rapidly extended, even though primer extension is often paused when the added RMP is translocated at the i + 3 position (with i the nascent base pair at an initial insertion site of RMP) or when the concentrations of the subsequent nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are below their physiological concentrations.

Often, virus-induced suppression of host gene expression, including those involved in antiviral responses, contributes to viral pathogenicity. Accordingly, clarifying the mechanisms of virus-induced disruption of host gene expression is important for understanding virus–host cell interactions and virus pathogenesis. Three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have emerged in the past two decades. All of them encode nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) in their genomes.

Zhang et al. determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of the full-length spike protein trimers of the Delta, Kappa, and Gamma variants of SARS-CoV-2 and studied their function and antigenic properties. The Delta spike protein fused membranes more efficiently at low levels of the cellular receptor ACE2, and its pseudotyped viruses infected target cells substantially more rapidly than all other variants tested, possibly at least partly accounting for its heightened transmissibility.

Various anti-inflammatory therapeutics have shown mixed efficacy in treating COVID-19, and the mechanisms by which hyperinflammation occurs are not well understood. Previous research indicated that monocytes, a key innate immune cell, undergo metabolic reprogramming and produce inflammatory cytokines when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that binding by the viral spike protein mediates this effect, and that drugs which regulate immunometabolism could inhibit the inflammatory response in monocytes. Monocytes stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in glycolytic metabolism that was associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. This response was dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, as chetomin inhibited glycolysis and cytokine production. Inhibition of glycolytic metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or glucose deprivation also inhibited the glycolytic response, and 2-DG strongly suppressed cytokine production. Glucose-deprived monocytes rescued cytokine production by upregulating oxidative phosphorylation, an effect which was not present in 2-DG-treated monocytes due to the known effect of 2-DG on suppressing mitochondrial metabolism. Finally, pre-treatment of monocytes with metformin strongly suppressed spike protein-mediated cytokine production in monocytes, and abrogated glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. Likewise, metformin pre-treatment blocked cytokine induction by SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 in direct infection experiments in monocytes. In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a pro-inflammatory immunometabolic response in monocytes that can be suppressed by metformin, and metformin likewise suppresses inflammatory responses to live SARS-CoV-2.

Although potential internal modifications have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the function of the SARS-CoV-2 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in the viral life cycle is unclear. ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global public crisis. Although viral RNA modification has been reported based on the transcriptome architecture, the types and functions of RNA modification are still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the roles of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in SARS-CoV-2. Our methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) and Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained m6A modification. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection not only increased the expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) but also altered its distribution. Modification of METTL3 expression by short hairpin RNA or plasmid transfection for knockdown or overexpression, respectively, affected viral replication. Furthermore, the viral key protein RdRp interacted with METTL3, and METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the presence of RdRp. RdRp appeared to modulate the sumoylation and ubiquitination of METTL3 via an unknown mechanism. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the host m6A modification complex interacted with viral proteins to modulate SARS-CoV-2 replication. IMPORTANCE Internal chemical modifications of viral RNA play key roles in the regulation of viral replication and gene expression. Although potential internal modifications have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the function of the SARS-CoV-2 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in the viral life cycle is unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA underwent m6A modification by host m6A machinery. SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the expression pattern of methyltransferases and demethylases, while the expression level of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) was linked to the viral replication. Further study showed that METTL3 interacted with viral RNA polymerase RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which influenced not only the distribution but also the posttranslational modification of METTL3.

While the cap structure of RNA, including CoV RNA, is important for translation, previous studies indicate that the cap also contributes to viral evasion from the host immune response. ABSTRACT The ongoing coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Understanding the immunological and pathological processes of coronavirus diseases is crucial for the rational design of effective vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. Previous studies showed that 2′-O-methylation of the viral RNA cap structure is required to prevent the recognition of viral RNAs by intracellular innate sensors. Here, we demonstrate that the guanine N7-methylation of the 5′ cap mediated by coronavirus nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) contributes to viral evasion of the type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated immune response and pathogenesis in mice. A Y414A substitution in nsp14 of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) significantly decreased N7-methyltransferase activity and reduced guanine N7-methylation of the 5′ cap in vitro. Infection of myeloid cells with recombinant MHV harboring the nsp14-Y414A mutation (rMHVnsp14-Y414A) resulted in upregulated expression of IFN-I and ISG15 mainly via MDA5 signaling and in reduced viral replication compared to that of wild-type rMHV. rMHVnsp14-Y414A replicated to lower titers in livers and brains and exhibited an attenuated phenotype in mice. This attenuated phenotype was IFN-I dependent because the virulence of the rMHVnsp14-Y414A mutant was restored in Ifnar−/− mice. We further found that the comparable mutation (Y420A) in SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 (rSARS-CoV-2nsp14-Y420A) also significantly decreased N7-methyltransferase activity in vitro, and the mutant virus was attenuated in K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice. Moreover, infection with rSARS-CoV-2nsp14-Y420A conferred complete protection against subsequent and otherwise lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, indicating the vaccine potential of this mutant. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, use several strategies to evade the host innate immune responses. While the cap structure of RNA, including CoV RNA, is important for translation, previous studies indicate that the cap also contributes to viral evasion from the host immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that the N7-methylated cap structure of CoV RNA is pivotal for virus immunoevasion. Using recombinant MHV and SARS-CoV-2 encoding an inactive N7-methyltransferase, we demonstrate that these mutant viruses are highly attenuated in vivo and that attenuation is apparent at very early times after infection. Virulence is restored in mice lacking interferon signaling. Further, we show that infection with virus defective in N7-methylation protects mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the N7-methylase might be a useful target in drug and vaccine development.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that the N7-methylated cap structure of CoV RNA is pivotal for virus immunoevasion and shows that infection with virus defective in N 7-methylation protects mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that theN7- methylase might be a useful target in drug and vaccine development."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":469,"details":{"paperId":"f3eea4bedd04482dddcac8fa26bcef8e34ebf56a","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8385902","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkab677","CorpusId":"235452169","PubMed":"34352100"},"title":"NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain","abstract":"Nsp12, the catalytic subunit of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), contains two active sites that catalyze nucleotidyl-monophosphate (NMP) transfer (NMPylation).

The second active site resides in a Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain.

Thus, the understanding of fundamental aspects of SARS-CoV-2 is of extreme importance. In this work, we have focused our attention on the viral ribonuclease (RNase) nsp14, since this protein was considered one of the most interferon antagonists from SARS-CoV-2, and affects viral replication. This RNase is a multifunctional protein that harbors two distinct activities, an N-terminal 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), both with critical roles in coronaviruses life cycle. Namely, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN knockout mutants are non-viable, indicating nsp14 as a prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs. Nsp14 ExoN activity is stimulated through the interaction with the nsp10 protein, which has a pleiotropic function during viral replication. In this study, we have performed the first biochemical characterization of the complex nsp14-nsp10 from SARS-CoV-2. Here we confirm the 3’-5’ exoribonuclease and MTase activities of nsp14 in this new Coronavirus, and the critical role of nsp10 in upregulating the nsp14 ExoN activity in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 N7-MTase activity is functionally independent of the ExoN activity. The nsp14 MTase activity also seems to be independent of the presence of nsp10 cofactor, contrarily to nsp14 ExoN. Until now, there is no available structure for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex. As such, we have modelled the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex based on the 3D structure of the complex from SARS-CoV (PDB ID 5C8S). We also have managed to map key nsp10 residues involved in its interaction with nsp14, all of which are also shown to be essential for stimulation of the nsp14 ExoN activity. This reinforces the idea that a stable interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is strictly required for the nsp14-mediated ExoN activity of SARS-CoV-2, as observed for SARS-CoV. We have studied the role of conserved DEDD catalytic residues of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN. Our results show that motif I of ExoN domain is essential for the nsp14 function contrasting to the functionality of these conserved catalytic residues in SARS-CoV, and in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavírus (MERS).

The recent paper by Zhang et al. (1) suggests a potential explanation of this phenomenon by claiming that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can integrate into the genome of infected human cells. The authors also reanalyze RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and report that SARS-CoV-2− host chimeric reads are present in cells and patient tissues. Given the potential implications of this research on the long-term impacts of COVID-19, we feel that it’s necessary to scrutinize the evidence presented. To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be retrotranscribed and integrated into the genome, the authors conducted a proof-of-principle experiment where human lung cells (Calu3) and kidney cells overexpressing class I transposable elements andwild type (HEK293TL1/HEK293T) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subjected to high-throughput DNA sequencing (1). The very low frequency of identified chimeric events (Table 1) suggests that SARS-CoV-2 integration into the host genome is unlikely. Given that the HEK293T-L1 model increases detection of “rare integration events” and L1 can retrotranspose any polyadenylated cellular RNA (2) and “insertions” are found preferentially in protein-coding exons, a bias unknown to L1 endonuclease insertions (3), these findings are likely spurious. Additionally, 2 of the identified 61 chimeric nanopore genomic DNA (gDNA) reads contain human DNA from separate chromosomes (chr1,chr22 and chr18,chrX, respectively), suggesting a portion of chimeric gDNA nanopore reads have arisen due to infrequent technical artifacts, such as base-calling software not recognizing an open-pore state between distinct molecules. Further to this, the authors reanalyzed published sequencing data and identified SARS-CoV-2 and human host chimeric reads in vitro and in patient RNA-seq (1). They show that the fraction of human–viral chimeric reads derived from negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNAs is higher in patients than that observed in vitro. These data are presented as evidence of SARS-CoV-2 integration and transcription. We question the presented data as evidence for this phenomenon for several key reasons. Firstly, chimeric virus−host reads are often reported in RNA-seq (4), including SARS-CoV-2 (5). This is partly due to complementary DNA fusions introduced during the reverse transcription step of library preparation (6). Secondly, larger pools of negativesense SARS-CoV-2 chimeric reads may be due to differences in RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing platform. Given that negative-sense RNA is formed during the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and a template for messenger RNA production, significant variation of negative-sense reads is expected in patient RNA samples. Finally, there is no evidence of coronaviruses ever having integrated into the germline of host species, as might be expected if retrotranscription and integration occurs in nature, as systematic screening of >750 animal species failed to identify any coronavirus-derived endogenous viral elements (7).","publicationTypes":["LettersAndComments"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The very low frequency of identified chimeric events suggests that SARS-CoV-2 integration into the host genome is unlikely, and there is no evidence of coronaviruses ever having integrated into the germline of host species, as systematic screening of animal species failed to identify any coronavirus-derived endogenous viral elements."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":804,"details":{"paperId":"6bc8d2b23ab0c3b4176d13be013e4de5c640c2ff","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8482139","DOI":"10.3390/ncrna7030054","CorpusId":"237941747","PubMed":"34564316"},"title":"Non-Coding RNAs in COVID-19: Emerging Insights and Current Questions","abstract":"The highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019, igniting an unprecedented pandemic.

The definition of SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames is a key step in delineating targets for vaccination and treatment for COVID-19. Here, we report an integrative analysis of three independent direct RNA sequencing datasets of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. We find strong evidence for variant open reading frames (ORFs) encoded by SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A variant transcript for the matrix protein (M) lacking its N-terminal transmembrane domain, initiated by a TTG start codon, is produced by a strong transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS)-mediated junction within the M ORF and represents up to 19% of all M ORFs. Sporadic non-canonical junctions in the spike (S) ORF lead to N-terminal truncations that remove the N-terminal and receptor-binding domains from up to 25% of S ORFs. Surprisingly, nearly all ORFs from ORF1a identified in these transcriptome sequences were variant. These ORFs contain the first 200-800 amino acids of ORF1a and may represent a mechanism to regulate the relative abundance of ORF1a nonstructural proteins. We show there is strong transcriptome and junctional support for variant ORF1a ORFs in independent direct RNA sequencing and short-read RNA sequencing datasets, and further show that up to 1/3 of these ORFs are expected to have C-terminal fusions with downstream genes.

Here, we investigate whether ORF10 hijacks CRL2ZYG11B or functions in other ways, such as to inhibit CRL2ZYG11B or be degraded by it.

Several SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins are believed to involve in the inhibition of IFN signaling.

ORF3a induced SOCS1 elevation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. RNAi-mediated silencing of SOCS1 efficiently abolished ORF3a-induced blockage of JAK/STAT signaling.

Silencing of SOCS1 by siRNA distinctly blocked ORF3a-induced JAK2 ubiquitination and degradation. These results demonstrate that ORF3a dampens IFN signaling via upregulating SOCS1, which suppressed STAT1 phosphorylation and accelerated JAK2 ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation.

Recombinant versions of the spike protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) are necessary for seropositivity assays and can potentially serve as vaccines against viral infection. RBD plays key roles in the spike protein’s structure and function, and thus, comprehensive characterization of recombinant RBD is critically important for biopharmaceutical applications. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry has been widely used to characterize post-translational modifications in proteins, including glycosylation. Most studies of RBDs were performed at the proteolytic peptide (bottom-up proteomics) or released glycan level because of the technical challenges in resolving highly heterogeneous glycans at the intact protein level. Herein, we evaluated several online separation techniques: (1) C2 reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), (2) capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), and (3) acrylamide-based monolithic hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) to separate intact recombinant RBDs with varying combinations of glycosylations (glycoforms) for top-down mass spectrometry (MS). Within the conditions we explored, the HILIC method was superior to RPLC and CZE at separating RBD glycoforms, which differ significantly in neutral glycan groups. In addition, our top-down analysis readily captured unexpected modifications (e.g., cysteinylation and N-terminal sequence variation) and low abundance, heavily glycosylated proteoforms that may be missed by using glycopeptide data alone.

ABSTRACT The ultimate outcome of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unknown and is dependent on a complex interplay of its pathogenicity, transmissibility, and population immunity. In the current study, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large-scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome-scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) (MFED of 7 to 9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analyzed and created by several hundred consecutive energetically favored stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-associated RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses—even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus that is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterized, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represents important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility. IMPORTANCE The detection and characterization of large-scale RNA secondary structure in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 indicate an extraordinary and unsuspected degree of genome structural organization; this could be effectively visualized through a newly developed contour plotting method that displays positions, structural features, and conservation of RNA secondary structure between related viruses. Such RNA structure imposes a substantial evolutionary cost; paired sites showed greater restriction in diversity and represent a substantial additional constraint in reconstructing its molecular epidemiology. Its biological relevance arises from previously documented associations between possession of structured genomes and persistence, as documented for HCV and several other RNA viruses infecting humans and mammals. Shared properties potentially conferred by large-scale structure in SARS-CoV-2 include increasing evidence for prolonged infections and induced immune dysfunction that prevents development of protective immunity.

Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells. Results Our analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host defense and cell survival.

This cascade depends on the recruitment of Hsp90-bound proteins to the N-terminal domain of TOM70. Binding of Orf9b to TOM70 decreases the expression of IFN-I; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We show that the binding of Orf9b to TOM70 inhibits the recruitment of Hsp90 and chaperone-associated proteins. We characterized the binding site of Orf9b within the C-terminal domain of TOM70 and found that a serine in position 53 of Orf9b and a glutamate in position 477 of TOM70 are crucial for the association of both proteins. A phosphomimetic variant Orf9bS53E showed drastically reduced binding to TOM70 and did not inhibit Hsp90 recruitment, suggesting that Orf9b–TOM70 complex formation is regulated by phosphorylation.

Here, we investigated both the essentiality of the host N-glycosylation pathway and SARS-CoV-2 N-glycans for infection.

Here, we investigate the assembly state and RNA binding properties of the full-length nucleocapsid protein using native mass spectrometry. We find that dimers, and not monomers, of full-length N protein bind RNA, implying that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we find that N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs which are known to form short stem loop structures. Unexpectedly, we found that N undergoes proteolytic processing within the linker region, separating the two major domains. This process results in the formation of at least five proteoforms that we sequenced using electron transfer dissociation, higher-energy collision induced dissociation and corroborated by peptide mapping. The cleavage sites identified are in highly conserved regions leading us to consider the potential roles of the resulting proteoforms. We found that monomers of N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA with the same preference for GGG motifs and that the oligomeric state of a C-terminal proteoform (N156-419) is sensitive to pH. We then tested interactions of the proteoforms with the immunophilin cyclophilin A, a key component in coronavirus replication. We found that N1-209 and N1-273 bind directly to cyclophilin A, an interaction that is abolished by the approved immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. In addition, we found the C-terminal proteoform N156-419 generated the highest antibody response in convalescent plasma from patients >6 months from initial COVID-19 diagnosis when compared to the other proteoforms.

The closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a bat coronavirus named RaTG13 (BatCoV-RaTG13).

Compared with influenza virus and paramyxovirus membrane fusion proteins, the cleavage activation mechanism of coronavirus S protein is much more complex. The S protein has two cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2′), and the cleavage motif for furin protease at the S1/S2 site that results from a unique four‐amino acid insertion is one of the distinguishing features of SARS‐CoV‐2. The viral particle incorporates the S protein, which has already undergone S1/S2 cleavage by furin, and then undergoes further cleavage at the S2′ site, mediated by the type II transmembrane serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), after binding to the receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to facilitate membrane fusion at the plasma membrane. In addition, SARS‐CoV‐2 can enter the cell by endocytosis and be proteolytically activated by cathepsin L, although this is not a major mode of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. SARS‐CoV‐2 variants with enhanced infectivity have been emerging throughout the ongoing pandemic, and there is a close relationship between enhanced infectivity and changes in S protein cleavability. All four variants of concern carry the D614G mutation, which indirectly enhances S1/S2 cleavability by furin. The P681R mutation of the delta variant directly increases S1/S2 cleavability, enhancing membrane fusion and SARS‐CoV‐2 virulence.

In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles hardly induced cytokine expression, suggesting viral escape from the host response.

Therefore, it is imperative that we learn as much as we can about the biochemistry of the coronavirus proteins to inform development of therapy. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), encodes two proteases required for replication. The main protease (Mpro), encoded as part of two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, is responsible for 11 different cleavages of these viral polyproteins to produce mature proteins required for viral replication. Mpro is therefore an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. Certain proteins in cells under oxidative stress undergo modification of reactive cysteines. We show Mpro is susceptible to glutathionylation, leading to inhibition of dimerization and activity. Activity of glutathionylated Mpro could be restored with reducing agents or glutaredoxin. Analytical studies demonstrated that glutathionylated Mpro primarily exists as a monomer and that modification of a single cysteine with glutathione is sufficient to block dimerization and inhibit its activity. Gel filtration studies as well as analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed that glutathionylated Mpro exists as a monomer. Tryptic and chymotryptic digestions of Mpro as well as experiments using a C300S Mpro mutant revealed that Cys300, which is located at the dimer interface, is a primary target of glutathionylation. Moreover, Cys300 is required for inhibition of activity upon Mpro glutathionylation. These findings indicate that Mpro dimerization and activity can be regulated through reversible glutathionylation of a non-active site cysteine, Cys300, which itself is not required for Mpro activity, and provides a novel target for the development of agents to block Mpro dimerization and activity. This feature of Mpro may have relevance to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and related bat coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is imperative that we learn as much as we can about the biochemistry of the coronavirus proteins to inform development of therapy. One attractive target is the main protease (Mpro), a dimeric enzyme necessary for viral replication. Most work thus far developing Mpro inhibitors has focused on the active site. Our work has revealed a regulatory mechanism for Mpro activity through glutathionylation of a cysteine (Cys300) at the dimer interface, which can occur in cells under oxidative stress. Cys300 glutathionylation inhibits Mpro activity by blocking its dimerization. This provides a novel accessible and reactive target for drug development. Moreover, this process may have implications for disease pathophysiology in humans and bats. It may be a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to limit replication and avoid killing host bats when they are under oxidative stress during flight.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Findings indicate that Mpro dimerization and activity can be regulated through reversible glutathionylation of a non-active site cysteine, Cys300, which itself is not required for Mpro activity, and provides a novel target for the development of agents to block Mpro brightness and activity."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":415,"details":{"paperId":"0e1c566cde789e1fc9e42c8a44f7210129676328","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7604432","MAG":"3092050068","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2012294117","CorpusId":"222216832","PubMed":"33028676"},"title":"Remdesivir targets a structurally analogous region of the Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 polymerases","abstract":"Significance Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog prodrug that has been evaluated in humans against acute Ebola virus disease; it also recently received emergency use authorization for treating COVID-19.

The significance of our study lies not only in characterizing this particular mutation, but also in relating it to a resistance mutation observed in a similar structural motif of coronaviruses. Our findings thereby indicate a consistent mechanism of action by remdesivir across genetically divergent RNA viruses causing diseases of high consequence in humans. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug that has been clinically evaluated in Ebola virus patients and recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) for treatment of COVID-19. With approvals from the Federal Select Agent Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Institutional Biosecurity Board, we characterized the resistance profile of remdesivir by serially passaging Ebola virus under remdesivir selection; we generated lineages with low-level reduced susceptibility to remdesivir after 35 passages. We found that a single amino acid substitution, F548S, in the Ebola virus polymerase conferred low-level reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. The F548 residue is highly conserved in filoviruses but should be subject to specific surveillance among novel filoviruses, in newly emerging variants in ongoing outbreaks, and also in Ebola virus patients undergoing remdesivir therapy. Homology modeling suggests that the Ebola virus polymerase F548 residue lies in the F-motif of the polymerase active site, a region that was previously identified as susceptible to resistance mutations in coronaviruses. Our data suggest that molecular surveillance of this region of the polymerase in remdesivir-treated COVID-19 patients is also warranted.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This study identified a single amino acid residue in the Ebola virus polymerase that conferred low-level resistance to remdesivir, indicating a consistent mechanism of action by remdesvir across genetically divergent RNA viruses causing diseases of high consequence in humans."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":140,"details":{"paperId":"40b77ea17411b6a6cd7a3e529bf532a6e0876ced","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7826143","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173897","CorpusId":"231689851","PubMed":"33497607"},"title":"Repositioning of histamine H1 receptor antagonist: Doxepin inhibits viropexis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudovirus by blocking ACE2","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Preliminary results indicate that the histamine H1 receptor antagonist, doxepin, is a viable drug candidate for clinical trials, and it is hoped the work timely provides rational help for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to control the rapid spread of SARS-Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":260,"details":{"paperId":"2f67d0b15823fb4925a88b77ed43707a26ee1d28","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8231661","DOI":"10.1021/jasms.1c00086","CorpusId":"235424846","PubMed":"34121407"},"title":"Revealing the Structural Plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 Using Structural Proteomics","abstract":"Coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural proteins (nsps) assemble to form the replication–transcription complex (RTC) responsible for viral RNA synthesis. nsp7 and nsp8 are important cofactors of the RTC, as they interact and regulate the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other nsps. To date, no structure of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7:nsp8 complex has been published. The current understanding of this complex is based on structures from truncated constructs, with missing electron densities, or from related CoV species where SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 share upward of 90% sequence identity. Despite available structures solved using crystallography and cryo-EM representing detailed static snapshots of the nsp7:nsp8 complex, it is evident that the complex has a high degree of structural plasticity. However, relatively little is known about the conformational dynamics of the individual proteins and how they complex to interact with other nsps. Here, the solution-based structural proteomic techniques, hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), illuminate the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 full-length nsp7 and nsp8 proteins and the nsp7:nsp8 protein complex. Results presented from the two techniques are complementary and validate the interaction surfaces identified from the published three-dimensional heterotetrameric crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 truncated nsp7:nsp8 complex. Furthermore, mapping of XL-MS data onto higher-order complexes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 do not assemble into a hexadecameric structure as implied by the SARS-CoV full-length nsp7:nsp8 crystal structure.

Numerous antiviral targets are being investigated, but nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) stands out as a highly conserved and yet understudied target. Nsp13 is a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase that translocates along and unwinds viral RNA in an ATP-dependent manner. Currently, there are no available structures of nsp13 from SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 with either ATP or RNA bound, which presents a significant hurdle to the rational design of therapeutics. To address this knowledge gap, we have built models of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in Apo, ATP, ssRNA and ssRNA+ATP substrate states. Using 30 μs of a Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation (at least 6 μs per substrate state), these models were confirmed to maintain substrate binding poses that are similar to other SF1 helicases. A Gaussian mixture model and linear discriminant analysis structural clustering protocol was used to identify key structural states of the ATP-dependent RNA translocation mechanism. Namely, four RNA-nsp13 structures are identified that exhibit ATP-dependent populations and support the inchworm mechanism for translocation. These four states are characterized by different RNA-binding poses for motifs Ia, IV, and V and suggest a power stroke-like motion of domain 2A relative to domain 1A. This structural and mechanistic insight of nsp13 RNA translocation presents novel targets for the further development of

There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1.

It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) presents early in body fluids during infection. The direct involvement of N-protein in lung injury is poorly understood. Methods Recombinant N-protein was pretreated with polymyxin B, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralizing agent. C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ (resistant to LPS), and C3H/HeN (control for C3H/HeJ) mice were exposed to N-protein via intratracheal administration to examine acute lung injury. In vitro, bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) were cultured with N-protein to study phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB) p65, macrophage polarization, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Results N-protein produced acute lung injury in C57BL/6 mice, with elevated protein permeability, total cell count, neutrophil infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchioalveolar lavage. N-protein also induced lung injury in both C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice, indicating that the effect could not be attributed to the LPS contamination. N-protein triggered phosphorylation of NF-ĸB p65 in vitro, which was abolished by both N-protein denaturation and treatment with an antibody for N-protein, demonstrating that the effect is N-protein specific. In addition, N-protein promoted M1 macrophage polarization and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which was also blocked by N-protein denaturation and antibody for N-protein.

Previous reports have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 N protein, along with some non-structural and accessory proteins, efficiently suppresses INF-β production by interacting with RIG-I, an important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) involved in the recognition of pathogen-derived molecules. In the present study, we better characterized the mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 N counteracts INF-β secretion and affects RIG-I signaling pathways. In detail, when the N protein was ectopically expressed, we noted a marked decrease in TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activation. The capability of the N protein to bind to, and probably mask, TRIM25 could be the consequence of its antagonistic activity.

ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is bringing an unprecedented health crisis to the world. To date, our understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host innate immunity is still limited. Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 12 (NSP12) was able to suppress interferon-β (IFN-β) activation in IFN-β promoter luciferase reporter assays, which provided insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this study, we demonstrated that IFN-β promoter-mediated luciferase activity was reduced during coexpression of NSP12. However, we could show NSP12 did not affect IRF3 or NF-κB activation. Moreover, IFN-β production induced by Sendai virus (SeV) infection or other stimulus was not affected by NSP12 at mRNA or protein level. Additionally, the type I IFN signaling pathway was not affected by NSP12, as demonstrated by the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Further experiments revealed that different experiment systems, including protein tags and plasmid backbones, could affect the readouts of IFN-β promoter luciferase assays. In conclusion, unlike as previously reported, our study showed SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 protein is not an IFN-β antagonist. It also rings the alarm on the general usage of luciferase reporter assays in studying SARS-CoV-2.

However, most of these results were generated from IFN-β promoter luciferase reporter assay and have not been validated functionally. In our study, we found that, although NSP12 could suppress IFN-β promoter luciferase activity, it showed no inhibitory effect on IFN-β production or its downstream signaling. Further study revealed that contradictory results could be generated from different experiment systems. On one hand, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 could not suppress IFN-β signaling.

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed in part to asymptomatic transmission, where infected individuals shed large amounts of virus before the onset of disease. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While previous studies have shown that several SARS-CoV-2 proteins can antagonize the interferon (IFN) response, some of the mechanisms by which they do so are not well understood. In this study, we describe two novel mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 blocks the IFN pathway. Type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were poorly induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and once infection was established, cells were highly resistant to ectopic induction of IFNs and ISGs. Levels of two key IFN signaling pathway components, Tyk2 and STAT2, were significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Expression of nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) or nucleocapsid in the absence of other viral proteins was sufficient to block IFN induction, but only NSP1 was able to inhibit IFN signaling. Mapping studies suggest that NSP1 prevents IFN induction in part by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation. In addition, NSP1-induced depletion of Tyk2 and STAT2 dampened ISG induction. Together, our data provide new insights into how SARS-CoV-2 successfully evades the IFN system to establish infection. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, a serious disease that can have a myriad of symptoms from loss of taste and smell to pneumonia and hypercoagulation. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed in part to asymptomatic transmission, where infected individuals shed large amounts of virus before the onset of disease. This is likely due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to effectively suppress the innate immune system, including the IFN response. Indeed, we show that the IFN response is efficiently blocked during SARS-CoV-2 infection, a process that is mediated in large part by nonstructural protein 1 and nucleocapsid.

Although the NLRP3 inflammasome activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses, these viruses must evade inflammasome-mediated antiviral immune responses to establish primary replication.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense.

However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5’ UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1.

Moreover, Nsp14 expression altered the splicing of more than 1000 genes and resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of circRNAs, which are linked to innate immunity.

This study describes a molecular characterization of innate immune evasion mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 main protease and subsequent development of a small-molecule inhibitor. ABSTRACT Newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic with astonishing mortality and morbidity. The high replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are remarkably distinct from those of previous closely related coronaviruses, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The innate immune defense is a physical barrier that restricts viral replication. We report here that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 main protease targets RIG-I and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein via two distinct mechanisms for inhibition. Specifically, Nsp5 cleaves off the 10 most-N-terminal amino acids from RIG-I and deprives it of the ability to activate MAVS, whereas Nsp5 promotes the ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation of MAVS. As such, Nsp5 potently inhibits interferon (IFN) induction by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in an enzyme-dependent manner. A synthetic small-molecule inhibitor blunts the Nsp5-mediated destruction of cellular RIG-I and MAVS and processing of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins, thus restoring the innate immune response and impeding SARS-CoV-2 replication. This work offers new insight into the immune evasion strategy of SARS-CoV-2 and provides a potential antiviral agent to treat CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

In this study, we discovered that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in the inhibition of interferon beta (IFN-β) production. N protein repressed IFN-β production induced by poly(I:C) or upon Sendai virus (SeV) infection.

We characterized the role of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 in modulating antiviral immunity. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 N resulted in the attenuation of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor-mediated interferon (IFN) production and IFN-induced gene expression.

The ectopic expression of G3BP1 in N-expressing cells was sufficient to reverse this phenotype. Since N is an RNA-binding protein, we performed iCLIP-sequencing experiments in cells, with or without exposure to oxidative stress, to identify the host RNAs targeted by N. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 N protein binds directly to thousands of mRNAs under both conditions. Like the G3BPs stress granule proteins, N was found to predominantly bind its target mRNAs in their 3’UTRs.

Our comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics experiments confirm that the N protein is highly O-glycosylated and also contains significant levels of N-glycosylation. We were able to confirm the presence of O-glycans on seven sites with substantial glycan occupancy, in addition to less abundant O-glycans on four sites. We also detected N-glycans on two out of five potential N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we were able to confirm one phosphorylation site.

However, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenesis and therapy remains limited, emphasizing the urgent need for fundamental studies and drug development. Studies have shown that induction of macroautophagy/autophagy and hijacking of the autophagic machinery are essential for the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2; however, the mechanism of this manipulation and the function of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. In the present study, we identified ORF3a as an inducer of autophagy (in particular reticulophagy) and revealed that ORF3a localizes to the ER and induces RETREG1/FAM134B-related reticulophagy through the HMGB1-BECN1 (beclin 1) pathway. As a consequence, ORF3a induces ER stress and inflammatory responses through reticulophagy and then sensitizes cells to the acquisition of an ER stress-related early apoptotic phenotype and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a hijacks reticulophagy and then disrupts ER homeostasis to induce ER stress and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. ABSTRACT RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm often disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport to preferentially translate their own transcripts and prevent host antiviral responses. The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be a major inhibitor of interferon production in both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we show SARS-CoV-2-infected cells display an elevated level of nuclear mRNA accumulation compared to mock-infected cells. We demonstrate that ORF6 is responsible for this nuclear imprisonment of host mRNA, and using a cotransfected reporter assay, we show this nuclear retention of mRNA blocks expression of newly transcribed mRNAs. ORF6’s nuclear entrapment of host mRNA is associated with its ability to copurify with the mRNA export factors, Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly copurifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and presymptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also show that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 block nuclear import of a broad range of host proteins. Together, these data support a model in which ORF6 clogs the nuclear pore through its interactions with Rae1 and Nup98 to prevent both nuclear import and export, rendering host cells incapable of responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes multiple accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells accumulate poly(A) mRNA in the nucleus, which is attributed to the accessory protein ORF6. Nuclear entrapment of mRNA and reduced expression of newly transcribed reporter proteins are associated with ORF6’s interactions with the mRNA export proteins Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and copurifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. Both SARS-CoV ORF6 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 block nuclear import of a wide range of host factors through interactions with Rae1 and Nup98.

How SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to lung injury remains elusive.

We examined the cellular distribution of ORF8SARS-CoV-2 and its role in the regulation of human lung epithelial cell proliferation and antiviral immunity. Using live imaging and immunofluorescent staining analyses, we found that ectopically expressed ORF8SARS-CoV-2 forms aggregates in the cytosol and nuclear compartments of lung epithelial cells. Using in silico bioinformatic analysis, we found that ORF8SARS-CoV-2 possesses an intrinsic aggregation characteristic at its N-terminal residues 1-18. Cell culture did not reveal any effects of ORF8SARS-CoV-2 expression on lung epithelial cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, suggesting that ORF8SARS-CoV-2 aggregates do not affect these cellular processes. Interestingly, ectopic expression of ORF8SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cells suppressed basal expression of several antiviral molecules, including DHX58, ZBP1, MX1, and MX2. In addition, expression of ORF8SARS-CoV-2 attenuated the induction of antiviral molecules by IFNγ but not by IFNβ in lung epithelial cells. Taken together, ORF8SARS-CoV-2 is a unique viral accessory protein that forms aggregates when expressing in lung epithelial cells. It potently inhibits the expression of lung cellular anti-viral proteins at baseline and in response to IFNγ in lung epithelial cells, which may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 escape from the host antiviral innate immune response during early viral infection. In addition, it seems that formation of ORF8SARS-CoV-2 aggregate is independent from the viral infection. Thus, it would be interesting to examine whether any COVID-19 patients exhibit persistent ORF8 SARS-CoV-2 expression after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Previous studies revealed that the viral accessory protein Orf6 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit STAT1 nuclear translocation to block IFN signaling. In this study, we report that Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) where it binds directly to the Nup98-Rae1 complex to target the nuclear import pathway and mediate this inhibition. A better understanding of the strategies used by viruses to subvert host immune responses is critical for the design of novel antivirals and vaccines. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that is a serious global health problem. Evasion of IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is a common defense strategy that pathogenic viruses use to replicate and propagate in their host. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 exerts this anti-IFN activity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function.

Spike (S) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins have been putatively associated with these dysfunctions. In this work, we analyzed the recruitment of hemoglobin (Hb) and other metabolites (hemin and protoporphyrin IX-PpIX) by SARS-Cov2 proteins using different approaches. (2) Methods: shotgun proteomics (LC–MS/MS) after affinity column adsorption identified hemin-binding SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The parallel synthesis of the peptides technique was used to study the interaction of the receptor bind domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein with Hb and in silico analysis to identify the binding motifs of the N protein. The plaque assay was used to investigate the inhibitory effect of Hb and the metabolites hemin and PpIX on virus adsorption and replication in Vero cells. (3) Results: the proteomic analysis by LC–MS/MS identified the S, N, M, Nsp3, and Nsp7 as putative hemin-binding proteins. Six short sequences in the RBD and 11 in the NTD of the spike were identified by microarray of peptides to interact with Hb and tree motifs in the N protein by in silico analysis to bind with heme. An inhibitory effect in vitro of Hb, hemin, and PpIX at different levels was observed. Strikingly, free Hb at 1mM suppressed viral replication (99%), and its interaction with SARS-CoV-2 was localized into the RBD region of the spike protein.

The motifs of the RDB of SARS-CoV-2 spike, which binds Hb, and the sites of the heme bind-N protein were disclosed. In addition, these compounds and PpIX block the virus’s adsorption and replication.

Vascular endothelium can be infected by SARS-CoV-2,1 which triggers mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and glycolytic shift.2 Paradoxically, ACE2 is protective in the cardiovascular system, and SARS-CoV-1 S protein promotes lung injury by decreasing the level of ACE2 in the infected lungs.3 In the current study, we show that S protein alone can damage vascular endothelial cells (ECs) by downregulating ACE2 and consequently inhibiting mitochondrial function. We administered a pseudovirus expressing S protein (Pseu-Spike) to Syrian hamsters intratracheally. Lung damage was apparent in animals receiving PseuSpike, revealed by thickening of the alveolar septa and increased infiltration of mononuclear cells (Figure [A]). AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) phosphorylates ACE2 Ser-680, MDM2 (murine double minute 2) ubiquitinates ACE2 Lys-788, and crosstalk between AMPK and MDM2 determines the ACE2 level.4 In the damaged lungs, levels of pAMPK (phospho-AMPK), pACE2 (phospho-ACE2), and ACE2 decreased but those of MDM2 increased (Figure [B], i). Furthermore, complementary increased and decreased phosphorylation of eNOS (endothelial NO synthase) Thr-494 and Ser-1176 indicated impaired eNOS activity. These changes of pACE2, ACE2, MDM2 expression, and AMPK activity in endothelium were recapitulated by in vitro experiments using pulmonary arterial ECs infected with Pseu-Spike which was rescued by treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a reactive oxygen species inhibitor (Figure [B], ii).

As shown in Figure [C], ii, ECs with ACE2-L had a higher number of fragmented mitochondria when compared to those with ACE2-D.

We utilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in cultured human hepatocytes (Huh7.5) and pneumocytes (A549) to generate conditioned culture medium (CM). ABSTRACT Increased mortality in COVID-19 cases is often associated with microvascular complications. We have recently shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein promotes an inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6)/IL-6R-induced trans signaling response and alarmin secretion. Virus-infected or spike-transfected human epithelial cells exhibited an increase in senescence, with a release of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related inflammatory molecules. Introduction of the bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor AZD5153 to senescent epithelial cells reversed this effect and reduced SASP-related inflammatory molecule release in TMNK-1 or EAhy926 (representative human endothelial cell lines), when cells were exposed to cell culture medium (CM) derived from A549 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Cells also exhibited a senescence phenotype with enhanced p16, p21, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) expression and triggered SASP pathways. Inhibition of IL-6 trans signaling by tocilizumab and inhibition of inflammatory receptor signaling by the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor zanubrutinib, prior to exposure of CM to endothelial cells, inhibited p21 and p16 induction. We also observed an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A549 spike-transfected and endothelial cells exposed to spike-transfected CM. ROS generation in endothelial cell lines was reduced after treatment with tocilizumab and zanubrutinib. Cellular senescence was associated with an increased level of the endothelial adhesion molecules vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which have in vitro leukocyte attachment potential. Inhibition of senescence or SASP function prevented VCAM-1/ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte attachment. Taken together, we identified that human endothelial cells exposed to cell culture supernatant derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression displayed cellular senescence markers, leading to enhanced leukocyte adhesion. IMPORTANCE The present study was aimed at examining the underlying mechanism of extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-associated pathogenesis, with the notion that infection of the pulmonary epithelium can lead to mediators that drive endothelial dysfunction. We utilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in cultured human hepatocytes (Huh7.5) and pneumocytes (A549) to generate conditioned culture medium (CM). Endothelial cell lines (TMNK-1 or EAhy926) treated with CM exhibited an increase in cellular senescence markers by a paracrine mode and led to leukocyte adhesion. Overall, the link between these responses in endothelial cell senescence and a potential contribution to microvascular complication in productively SARS-CoV-2-infected humans is implicated. Furthermore, the use of inhibitors (BTK, IL-6, and BRD4) showed a reverse effect in the senescent cells.

ABSTRACT It has recently been shown that an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate (NL-02-2020) hijacks interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) for efficient replication in human lung cells, cardiomyocytes, and gut organoids. To date, several “variants of concern” (VOCs) showing increased infectivity and resistance to neutralization have emerged and globally replaced the early viral strains. Here, we determined whether the five current SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) maintained the dependency on IFITM proteins for efficient replication. We found that depletion of IFITM2 strongly reduces viral RNA production by all VOCs in the human epithelial lung cancer cell line Calu-3. Silencing of IFITM1 had modest effects, while knockdown of IFITM3 resulted in an intermediate phenotype. Strikingly, depletion of IFITM2 generally reduced infectious virus production by more than 4 orders of magnitude. In addition, an antibody directed against the N terminus of IFITM2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 VOC replication in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells, thought to represent major viral target cells in the lung. In conclusion, endogenously expressed IFITM proteins (especially IFITM2) are critical cofactors for efficient replication of genuine SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the currently dominant Omicron variant. IMPORTANCE Recent data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 requires endogenously expressed IFITM proteins for efficient infection. However, the results were obtained with an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Thus, it remained to be determined whether IFITMs are also important cofactors for infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs that outcompeted the original strains in the meantime. This includes the Omicron VOC, which currently dominates the pandemic. Here, we show that depletion of endogenous IFITM2 expression almost entirely prevents productive infection of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in human lung cells. In addition, an antibody targeting the N terminus of IFITM2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 VOC replication in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells.

Our results demonstrate that the S2′ cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those, greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through interaction of its spike protein (SARS2-S) with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and activation by proteases, in particular transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S (SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to that of SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector cell-target cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 was limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target cell-effector cell fusion was unaltered compared to that of wild-type (wt) SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2 cleavage (S2′) site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor bromhexine, unlike the inhibitor camostat, was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S. Paradoxically, bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity under some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend toward weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE Cell-cell fusion allows viruses to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2′ cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those, greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently being tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that bromhexine enhances fusion under some conditions. We therefore caution against the use of bromhexine in high dosages until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound ambroxol, which similarly to bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for ambroxol.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Cell-cell fusion allows viruses to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia by demonstrating that the S2′ cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS -CoV-2."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":664,"details":{"paperId":"da7d7fc4ab1765efd2dbbe90a4824122f7072fbc","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7471641","MAG":"3082011975","DOI":"10.1186/s13045-020-00954-7","CorpusId":"221479224","PubMed":"32887634"},"title":"SARS-CoV-2 binds platelet ACE2 to enhance thrombosis in COVID-19","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A novel function of SARS-CoV-2 on platelet activation via binding of Spike to ACE2 is uncovered, which may participate in thrombus formation and inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":591,"details":{"paperId":"a3ab860012cd307e55c38eefcf3cb716b8c1bc18","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8163077","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.abg7607","CorpusId":"233371698","PubMed":"33888467"},"title":"SARS-CoV-2 can recruit a heme metabolite to evade antibody immunity","abstract":"SARS-CoV-2 spike N-terminal domain harbors a potent epitope that can be modulated by binding of natural linear tetrapyrroles.

One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Multiple assays have been developed to validate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; most of them utilized lentiviral or vesicular stomatitis virus-based particles pseudotyped with the spike (S) protein, making them safe and acceptable to work with in many labs. However, these systems are only capable of measuring infection with purified particles. This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera. Based on available studies, this is the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection, for which the mechanisms are largely unknown. The findings suggest that this route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be of great importance for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Importance Immune surveillance of viral or bacterial infections is largely mediated by neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are produced after vaccination or infection, but their titers only partly reflect the degree of protection against infection. To identify protective antibodies, a neutralization test with replicating viruses or pseudoviruses (PVs) is required. This study developed lentiviral-based PV neutralization assays that, unlike similar systems reported earlier, enable quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in cell cocultures. Using both PVs and replication-competent virus, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection is considerably more resistant to serum neutralization than infection with purified viral particles. The tests are easy to set up in many labs, and are believed to be more informative for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 collective immunity or entry inhibitor screening.","publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell is developed, the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection."}},"tag":"OTHER"},{"id":206,"details":{"paperId":"9d3193d0fc76198c0be3ca1581f2402735b8babb","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8590447","DOI":"10.1016/j.nbd.2021.105561","CorpusId":"244077891","PubMed":"34780863"},"title":"SARS-CoV-2 deregulates the vascular and immune functions of brain pericytes via Spike protein","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 S protein impairs the vascular and immune regulatory functions of brain pericytes, which may account for vascular-mediated brain damage in COVID-19, and provides a better understanding for the mechanisms underlying cerebrovascular disorders in the disease."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":300,"details":{"paperId":"298bbc32885f30de90335663b1c92f391b072d6d","externalIds":{"MAG":"3037951856","PubMedCentral":"8190750","DOI":"10.1038/s41422-021-00519-4","CorpusId":"220281978","PubMed":"34112954"},"title":"SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like pathological damages and constitutes an antiviral target","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Prophylactic and therapeutic administration of the channel inhibitor effectively reduced both the viral load and secretion of inflammation cytokines in lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2)."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":479,"details":{"paperId":"6f3353ad5c1fcb3fb7e7c4556b646f14b29fe9d2","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7536074","MAG":"3084300316","DOI":"10.1098/rsob.200209","CorpusId":"219154435","PubMed":"32898469"},"title":"SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein topology in eukaryotic membranes","abstract":"Coronavirus E protein is a small membrane protein found in the virus envelope.

Infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with SARs-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus (SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV) markedly increased TF procoagulant activity at the cell surface and released TF+ extracellular vesicles (EVs).

Here, we performed single-molecule RNA visualization to examine the expression and localization of host mRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that the biogenesis of type I and type III IFN mRNAs is inhibited at multiple steps during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Lastly, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of IFN mRNAs is inhibited during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which we propose is a consequence of widespread degradation of host cytoplasmic basal mRNAs in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein, as well as the host antiviral endoribonuclease, RNase L.

tremendous global health concern. Since its first appearance in December 2019, the outbreak has already caused over 5.8 million infections worldwide (till 29 May 2020), with more than 0.35 million deaths. Early virus-mediated immune suppression is believed to be one of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes at least partially to the viral pathogenesis. In this study, we identified the key viral interferon antagonists of SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with two well-characterized SARS-CoV interferon antagonists, PLpro and orf6. Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and orf6, but not the unique orf8, could potently suppress primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Although SARS-CoV PLpro has been well-characterized for its potent interferon-antagonizing, deubiquitinase and protease activities, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, despite sharing high amino acid sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, loses both interferon-antagonising and deubiquitinase activities.

We showed that both SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 and SARS-CoV nsp5 cleave the NEMO at multiple sites (E152, Q205, and Q231). ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to pose an enormous threat to economic activity and public health worldwide. Previous studies have shown that the nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, also called 3C-like protease) of alpha- and deltacoronaviruses cleaves Q231 of the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), a key kinase in the RIG-I-like receptor pathway, to inhibit type I interferon (IFN) production. In this study, we found that both SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 and SARS-CoV nsp5 cleaved NEMO at multiple sites (E152, Q205, and Q231). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 exhibited a stronger ability to cleave NEMO than SARS-CoV nsp5. Sequence and structural alignments suggested that an S/A polymorphism at position 46 of nsp5 in SARS-CoV versus SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for this difference. Mutagenesis experiments showed that SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 (S46A) exhibited poorer cleavage of NEMO than SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 wild type (WT), while SARS-CoV nsp5 (A46S) showed enhanced NEMO cleavage compared with the WT protein. Purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 WT and SARS-CoV nsp5 (A46S) proteins exhibited higher hydrolysis efficiencies than SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 (S46A) and SARS-CoV nsp5 WT proteins in vitro. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 exhibited stronger inhibition of Sendai virus (SEV)-induced interferon beta (IFN-β) production than SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 (S46A), while introduction of the A46S substitution in SARS-CoV nsp5 enhanced suppression of SEV-induced IFN-β production. Taken together, these data show that S46 is associated with the catalytic activity and IFN antagonism by SARS-CoV-2 nsp5. IMPORTANCE The nsp5-encoded 3C-like protease is the main coronavirus protease, playing a vital role in viral replication and immune evasion by cleaving viral polyproteins and host immune-related molecules. We showed that both SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 and SARS-CoV nsp5 cleave the NEMO at multiple sites (E152, Q205, and Q231). This specificity differs from NEMO cleavage by alpha- and deltacoronaviruses, demonstrating the distinct substrate recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV nsp5. Compared with SARS-CoV nsp5, SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 encodes S instead of A at position 46. This substitution is associated with stronger catalytic activity, enhanced cleavage of NEMO, and increased interferon antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 nsp5.

Understanding the cellular and inhibiting the molecular mechanisms of spike-driven viral entry is a research priority in curbing the ongoing pandemic and preventing future coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we highlight that the generation of SARS-CoV-2 S2′ fragments, a proteolytic event occurring within the S2 subunit, is a molecular switch coupled to membrane fusion. Downstream of host receptor recognition, spike-driven syncytia formation requires the presence of an S2′ cleavage site at arginine 815 but not 685. Hence, the proteolytic processing of spike at the S2′ site upon its engagement of host ACE2 may serve as a potential antiviral target against the current SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus strains. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has resulted in tremendous loss worldwide. Although viral spike (S) protein binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been established, the functional consequences of the initial receptor binding and the stepwise fusion process are not clear. By utilizing a cell–cell fusion system, in complement with a pseudoviral infection model, we found that the spike engagement of ACE2 primed the generation of S2′ fragments in target cells, a key proteolytic event coupled with spike-mediated membrane fusion. Mutagenesis of an S2′ cleavage site at the arginine (R) 815, but not an S2 cleavage site at arginine 685, was sufficient to prevent subsequent syncytia formation and infection in a variety of cell lines and primary cells isolated from human ACE2 knock-in mice.

Critical cases of COVID-19 are characterized by the production of excessive amounts of cytokines and extensive lung damage, which is partially caused by the fusion of SARS-CoV-2–infected pneumocytes. Here, we found that cell fusion caused by the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein induced a type I interferon (IFN) response. This function of the S protein required its cleavage by proteases at the S1/S2 and the S2′ sites. We further showed that cell fusion damaged nuclei and resulted in the formation of micronuclei that were sensed by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS and led to the activation of its downstream effector STING. Phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator IRF3 and the expression of IFNB, which encodes a type I IFN, were abrogated in cGAS-deficient fused cells. Moreover, infection with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 also induced cell fusion, DNA damage, and cGAS-STING–dependent expression of IFNB.

The fused cells exhibited DNA damage and micronuclei, which colocalized with the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, and that led to the activation of the adaptor protein STING and stimulated the expression of genes encoding type I IFNs and of IFN-stimulated genes.

ORF3a triggers IL-1β expression via NFκB, thus priming the inflammasome while also activating it via ASC-dependent and -independent modes.

Here, the authors report that normal kidney‐specifically overexpressing SARS‐CoV‐2 N develops AKI, which worsens in mice under ischemic condition. Mechanistically, it is uncovered that SARS‐CoV‐2 N‐induced AKI is Smad3‐dependent as SARS‐CoV‐2 N protein can interact with Smad3 and enhance TGF‐β/Smad3 signaling to cause tubular epithelial cell death and AKI via the G1 cell cycle arrest mechanism.

In the present study, we identified ORF3 as an inducer of autophagy and revealed that ORF3 localizes to the ER and induces FAM134B-related ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway. As a consequence, ORF3 induces ER stress and inflammatory responses through ERphagy and sensitizes cells to ER stress-induced cell death, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 hijacks ERphagy and then harms ER homeostasis to induce inflammatory responses through excessive ER stress.

Importance SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication require autophagosome-like double-membrane vacuoles. Inhibition of autophagy suppresses viral replication, indicating the essential role of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks autophagy and the function of autophagy in the disease progression remain unknown. Here, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 induces ERphagy and consequently induces ER stress to trigger acute inflammatory responses and enhance sensitivity to ER stress-induced apoptosis.

It is also O-glycosylated, although the number of O-glycosites is less defined. Recent studies show that spike protein glycans play critical roles in viral entry and infection. The spike monomer has two subdomains, S1 and S2, and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 domain. In this study, we have characterized the site-specific glycosylation patterns of the HEK293 recombinant spike RBD and S1 domains as well as the intact spike derived from the whole virus produced in Vero cells. The Vero cell-derived spike from the WA1 strain and a D614G variant was analyzed. All spike proteins, S1, and RBDs were analyzed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer. N-glycans identified in HEK293-derived S1 were structurally diverse. Those found in the HEK293-derived RBD were highly similar to those in HEK293 S1 where N-glycosites were shared. Comparison of the whole cell-derived WA1 and D614G spike proteins revealed that N-glycosites local to the mutation site appeared to be more readily detected, hinting that these sites are more exposed to glycosylation machinery. Moreover, recombinant HEK293-derived S1 was occupied almost completely with complex glycan, while both WA1 and D614G derived from the Vero E6 cell whole virus were predominantly high-mannose glycans. This stands in stark contrast to glycosylation patterns seen in both CHO- and HEK cell-derived recombinant S1, S2, and the whole spike previously reported. Concerning O-glycosylation, our analyses revealed that HEK293 recombinant proteins possessed a range of O-glycosites with compositions consistent with Core type 1 and 2 glycans. The O-glycosites shared between the S1 and RBD constructs, sites T323 and T523, were occupied by a similar range of Core 1 and 2 type O-glycans. Overall, this study reveals that the sample nature and cell substrate used for production of these proteins can have a dramatic impact on the glycosylation profile.

PLpro is released from nsp3 through autocleavage, and then it cleaves the sites between nsp1/2, between nsp2/3 and between nsp3/4 with recognition motif of LXGG, and the sites in the C‐terminus of ubiquitin and of protein interferon‐stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) with recognition motif of RLRGG.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies elicited during virus infection or following vaccination. ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus, is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer mediates virus entry into host cells and cytopathic effects (syncytium formation). We studied the contribution of several S glycoprotein features to these functions, focusing on those that differ among related coronaviruses. Acquisition of the furin cleavage site by the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein decreased virus stability and infectivity but greatly enhanced syncytium-forming ability. Notably, the D614G change found in globally predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains increased infectivity, modestly enhanced responsiveness to the ACE2 receptor and susceptibility to neutralizing sera, and tightened association of the S1 subunit with the trimer. Apparently, these two features of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the furin cleavage site and D614G, have evolved to balance virus infectivity, stability, cytopathicity and antibody vulnerability. Although the endodomain (cytoplasmic tail) of the S2 subunit was not absolutely required for virus entry or syncytium formation, alteration of palmitoylated cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail decreased the efficiency of these processes. Since proteolytic cleavage contributes to the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, we evaluated the ability of protease inhibitors to suppress S glycoprotein function. Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors suppressed S-mediated cell-cell fusion but not virus entry. Synergy between inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases and TMPRSS2 suggests that both host proteases can activate the S glycoprotein during the process of syncytium formation. These results provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein-host cell interactions that likely contribute to the transmission and pathogenicity of this pandemic agent. IMPORTANCE The development of an effective and durable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential for combating the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies elicited during virus infection or following vaccination. Knowledge of the spike glycoprotein evolution, function, and interactions with host factors will help researchers to develop effective vaccine immunogens and treatments. Here, we identify key features of the spike glycoprotein, including the furin cleavage site and the D614G natural mutation, that modulate viral cytopathic effects, infectivity, and sensitivity to inhibition.

Methods and Findings In this study, we developed a Spike protein-pseudotyped (Spp) lentivirus with the proper tropism of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on the surface and tracked down the fate of Spp in wild type C57BL/6J mice receiving intravenous injection of the virus. A lentivirus with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) was used as the control.

Acute pneumonia was evident in animals 24 hpi. Spp lentivirus was mainly found in LDLR+ macrophages and pneumocytes in the lungs, but not in MARC1+ macrophages.

A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular infection by coronaviruses is therefore of utmost importance. A critical stage in infection is the fusion between viral and host membranes. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, and the influence of calcium and cholesterol, in this fusion process. Structural information from specular neutron reflectometry and small angle neutron scattering, complemented by dynamics information from quasi-elastic and spin-echo neutron spectroscopy, revealed strikingly different functions encoded in the Spike fusion domain. Calcium drives the N-terminal of the Spike fusion domain to fully cross the host plasma membrane. Removing calcium however re-orients the protein to the lipid leaflet in contact with the virus, leading to significant changes in lipid fluidity and rigidity. In conjunction with other regions of the fusion domain which are also positioned to bridge and dehydrate viral and host membranes, the molecular events leading to cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 are proposed. SIGNIFICANCE We have recreated here important elements of the critical membrane fusion mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by simplifying the system down to its core elements, amenable to experimental analysis by neutron scattering.

The ACE2-B0AT1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the collectrin-like domain of ACE2 mediating homodimerization. The RBD is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 mainly through polar residues.

Once inside host cells, not only does the virus hijack the cells' translational machinery to make viral proteins, but the virulence factor nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) also shuts down translation of host messenger RNA. Thoms et al. determined a 2.6-angstrom resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of a reconstituted complex of Nsp1 bound to the human 40S ribosomal subunit and showed that Nsp1 blocks the messenger RNA entry tunnel. A structural inventory of native Nsp1-ribosome complexes from human cells confirms this mechanism.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A major virulence factor of SARS-CoVs is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), which suppresses host gene expression by ribosome association. Here, we show that Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, resulting in shutdown of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation both in vitro and in cells. Structural analysis by cryo–electron microscopy of in vitro–reconstituted Nsp1-40S and various native Nsp1-40S and -80S complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks retinoic acid–inducible gene I–dependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection.

One protein known to play a critical role in the coronavirus life cycle is nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). ABSTRACT The periodic emergence of novel coronaviruses (CoVs) represents an ongoing public health concern with significant health and financial burdens worldwide. The most recent occurrence originated in the city of Wuhan, China, where a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) emerged causing severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. The continual emergence of novel coronaviruses underscores the importance of developing effective vaccines as well as novel therapeutic options that target either viral functions or host factors recruited to support coronavirus replication. The CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) has been shown to promote cellular mRNA degradation, block host cell translation, and inhibit the innate immune response to virus infection. Interestingly, deletion of the nsp1-coding region in infectious clones prevented the virus from productively infecting cultured cells. Because of nsp1’s importance in the CoV life cycle, it has been highlighted as a viable target for both antiviral therapy and vaccine development. However, the fundamental molecular and structural mechanisms that underlie nsp1 function remain poorly understood, despite its critical role in the viral life cycle. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the amino globular portion of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 (residues 10 to 127) at 1.77-Å resolution. A comparison of our structure with the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 structure reveals how mutations alter the conformation of flexible loops, inducing the formation of novel secondary structural elements and new surface features. Paired with the recently published structure of the carboxyl end of nsp1 (residues 148 to 180), our results provide the groundwork for future studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 structure and function during the viral life cycle. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. One protein known to play a critical role in the coronavirus life cycle is nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). As such, it has been highlighted in numerous studies as a target for both the development of antivirals and the design of live-attenuated vaccines. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of nsp1 derived from SARS-CoV-2 at 1.77-Å resolution. This structure will facilitate future studies focusing on understanding the relationship between structure and function for nsp1. In turn, understanding these structure-function relationships will allow nsp1 to be fully exploited as a target for both antiviral development and vaccine design.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A comparison of the authors' structure with the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 structure reveals how mutations alter the conformation of flexible loops, inducing the formation of novel secondary structural elements and new surface features."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":485,"details":{"paperId":"ba3059bc4be09f7d6c17750fa7b5c06b43331dd5","externalIds":{"MAG":"3098398625","DOI":"10.1101/2020.03.16.993386","CorpusId":"214723442"},"title":"Structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from 2019-nCoV, a major antiviral drug target","abstract":"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a global pandemic resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide.

Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, MDA5 is activated with K63-linked polyubiquitination and then triggers the recruitment of MAVS and activation of TBK1 and IKK, subsequently leading to IRF3 and NF-κB phosphorylation. Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) acts as an innate immune suppressor and inhibits type I IFN signaling to promote infection of RNA viruses. It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases. Importance The large-scale spread of COVID-19 is causing mass casualties worldwide, and the failure of antiviral immune treatment suggests immune evasion. It has been reported that several nonstructural proteins of severe coronaviruses suppress antiviral immune responses; however, the immune suppression mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we revealed that NSP8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly blocks the activation of the cytosolic viral dsRNA sensor MDA5 and significantly downregulates antiviral immune responses.

Lung inflammation depends on alveolar epithelial cell type I IFN signaling. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic, robustly activates the host immune system in critically ill patients. Understanding how the virus engages the immune system will facilitate the development of needed therapeutic strategies. In this study, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins spike (S) and envelope (E) activate the key immune signaling IFN pathway in both human and mouse immune and epithelial cells independent of viral infection and replication. These proteins induce reactive oxidative species generation and increases in human- and murine-specific, IFN-responsive cytokines and chemokines, similar to their upregulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Induction of IFN signaling is dependent on canonical but discrepant inflammatory signaling mediators, as the activation induced by S is dependent on IRF3, TBK1, and MyD88, whereas that of E is largely MyD88 independent. Furthermore, these viral surface proteins, specifically E, induced peribronchial inflammation and pulmonary vasculitis in a mouse model. Finally, we show that the organized inflammatory infiltrates are dependent on type I IFN signaling, specifically in lung epithelial cells.

The mutations in the Delta’s spike protein shift the protein towards a net positive electrostatic potential. To understand the key molecular drivers of the Delta infection, we investigate the cellular uptake of the Delta spike protein and Delta spike-bearing SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. Specific in vitro modification of ACE2 and syndecan expression enabled us to demonstrate that syndecan-4, the syndecan isoform abundant in the lung, enhances the transmission of the Delta variant by attaching its mutated spike glycoprotein and facilitating its cellular entry. Compared to the wild-type spike, the Delta one shows a higher affinity towards heparan sulfate proteoglycans than towards ACE2. In addition to attachment to the polyanionic heparan sulfate chains, the Delta spike’s molecular interactions with syndecan-4 also involve syndecan-4’s cell-binding domain that mediates cell-to-cell adhesion. Regardless of the complexity of these interactions, exogenously added heparin blocks Delta’s cellular entry as efficiently as syndecan-4 knockdown.

Application of this methodology to different viral proteins resulted in significant cross-link sets that revealed the connectivity within their structures. Importantly, we show that these cross-link sets are detailed enough to enable the integrative modeling of the full-length protein sequence. Consequently, we report the global structural organization of Nsp2 and the dimer of the nucleocapsid protein. We foresee that similar applications will be highly useful to study other recalcitrant proteins on which the mainstream structural approaches currently fail. Atomic structures of several proteins from the coronavirus family are still partial or unavailable. A possible reason for this gap is the instability of these proteins outside of the cellular context, thereby prompting the use of in-cell approaches. In situ cross-linking and mass spectrometry (in situ CLMS) can provide information on the structures of such proteins as they occur in the intact cell.

With three betacoronavirus epidemics in less than 20 y, there is an urgent need for therapies to combat new and existing coronavirus outbreaks. Our analysis of clinical data from over 300,000 patients in three major health systems demonstrates a 50% reduced risk of COVID-19 in patients taking lithium, a direct inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). We further show that GSK-3 is essential for phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and that GSK-3 inhibition blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. These findings suggest an antiviral strategy for COVID-19 and new coronaviruses that may arise in the future. The coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, and other coronavirus infections express a nucleocapsid protein (N) that is essential for viral replication, transcription, and virion assembly. Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication. Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains GSK-3 consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors, including lithium. We conducted a retrospective analysis of lithium use in patients from three major health systems who were PCR-tested for SARS-CoV-2. We found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.35–0.74], P = 0.005). We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Knockout of GSK3A and GSK3B demonstrates that GSK-3 is essential for N phosphorylation. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors block N phosphorylation and impair replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells in a cell-type–dependent manner.

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 assembly and budding is critical for the development of antiviral therapies. ABSTRACT As an enveloped virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains a membrane protein (M) that mediates viral release from cellular membranes. However, the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virion release remain poorly understood. In the present study, we performed RNA interference (RNAi) screening and identified the E3 ligase RNF5, which mediates the ubiquitination of SARS-CoV-2 M at residue K15 to enhance the interaction of the viral envelope protein (E) with M, whereas the deubiquitinating enzyme POH1 negatively regulates this process. The M-E complex ensures the uniform size of viral particles for viral maturation and mediates virion release. Moreover, M traffics from the Golgi apparatus to autophagosomes and uses autophagosomes for virion release, and this process is dependent on RNF5-mediated ubiquitin modification and M-E interaction. These results demonstrate that ubiquitin modification of SARS-CoV-2 M stabilizes the M-E complex and uses autophagosomes for virion release.

The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS‐CoV‐2 is a heavily glycosylated trimer that binds to host cell receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating viral entry. Evidence also shows that the S glycoprotein interacts with other receptors including dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). Glycosylation is a post‐translational modification important for proper folding and trafficking of membrane and secretory proteins. It plays a critical role not only for host cell proteins, but also in viral virulence, immunity evasion and receptor binding capabilities. This study focused on the modulation of glycosylation and its effects on the trafficking of the S1 subunit, ACE2 and DPPIV, in addition to its effect on their interactions. For this purpose, the S1 subunit was expressed in COS‐1 cells in the presence or absence of N‐butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB‐DNJ), an inhibitor of the ER‐located a‐glucosidases I and II, 1‐deoxymannojirimycin (dMM), an inhibitor of Golgi‐mannosidase I, or benzyl‐N‐acetyl‐α‐galactosaminide (benzyl‐GalNac), an inhibitor of O‐glycosylation. The data demonstrate that NB‐DNJ affects substantially the trafficking and secretion of S1 protein, while its overall synthetic levels remained unchanged. A similar effect was observed upon treatment of the cells with the benzyl‐GalNac. On the contrary, the presence of dMM in the culture medium did not affect the secretion of S1. Together, the data suggest that folding events implicating calnexin in the ER, the site of action of NB‐DNJ, as well as O‐glycans that are modulated by benzyl‐GalNac are crucial for the secretion of the S1 protein. We further investigated the trafficking of ACE2 and DPPIV in lung Calu‐3 and intestinal Caco‐2 cells in the presence or absence of the glycosylation modulators and their interaction with S1. The data demonstrate a reduced binding capacity of S1 to ACE2 in the presence of NB‐DNJ and dMM, while this interaction was enhanced in Calu‐3 cells upon inhibition of O‐glycosylation by benzyl‐GalNac. We conclude that glycosylation modulators differentially act on the secretory pathway of S1 and the receptors.

For (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14, both its enzymatic activities were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development. ABSTRACT Coronaviruses (CoVs) stand out for their large RNA genome and complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The bifunctional nsp14 contains 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. While the latter presumably supports mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously reported to have crippled but viable hypermutation phenotypes. Remarkably, using reverse genetics, a large set of corresponding ExoN knockout mutations has now been found to be lethal for another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). For 13 mutants, viral progeny could not be recovered, unless—as happened occasionally—reversion had first occurred. Only a single mutant was viable, likely because its E191D substitution is highly conservative. Remarkably, a SARS-CoV-2 ExoN knockout mutant was found to be unable to replicate, resembling observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses, but starkly contrasting with the documented phenotype of ExoN knockout mutants of the closely related SARS-CoV. Subsequently, we established in vitro assays with purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 to monitor its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that proved lethal in reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study strongly suggests that CoV nsp14 ExoN has an additional function, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis and thus differs from the proofreading function that, based on previous MHV and SARS-CoV studies, was proposed to boost longer-term replication fidelity.

ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19, the disease at the center of the current global pandemic. While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive (∼30-kb) SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyzed the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in silico pipeline to predict regions of high-base-pair content across long genomes and to pinpoint hot spots of well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity for stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of hepatitis C virus (HCV), one of the most structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis suggests various levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural open reading frames (ORFs) containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we took a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts, which, given the technical difficulty of experimentally separating cellular mixtures of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) from genomic RNA (gRNA), is a unique advantage of our in silico pipeline. The resulting findings provide a useful roadmap for planning focused empirical studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA biology and a preliminary guide for exploring potential SARS-CoV-2 RNA drug targets. IMPORTANCE The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is among the largest and most complex viral genomes, yet its RNA structural features remain relatively unexplored. Since RNA elements guide function in most RNA viruses, and they represent potential drug targets, it is essential to chart the architectural features of SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint regions that merit focused study. In this study, we found that RNA folding stability of SARS-CoV-2 genome is exceptional among viral genomes and we developed a method to directly compare levels of predicted secondary structure across SARS-CoV-2 domains. Remarkably, we found that coding regions display the highest structural propensity in the genome, forming motifs that differ between the genomic and subgenomic contexts.

COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic and has claimed over 2 million lives worldwide. Although the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have high homology, the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 differ significantly from those of SARS.

The viral protein encoded by open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all viral proteins, directly interacts with MHC-Ι molecules and mediates their down-regulation. In ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-Ι molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation via autophagy. Thus, SARS-CoV-2–infected cells are much less sensitive to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. ABSTRACT The cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses types 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) requires sequential protease processing of the viral spike glycoprotein. The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the spike precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons (IFNs) and, more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2, rather than IFITM3, and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Importantly, removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH and cathepsin dependent in late endosomes, where, like SARS-CoV-1 spike, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we found that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests that therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs. IMPORTANCE The furin cleavage site in the spike protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals, compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2 and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site, which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest that one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus, it may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2 and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site, which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments, and is found to be a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS- CoV- 2 replication."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":809,"details":{"paperId":"818cd88c955867aa3db2aebbbbdffa4f44d5647d","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7766253","DOI":"10.3390/v12121473","CorpusId":"229683263","PubMed":"33371200"},"title":"The RNA Architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 3′-Untranslated Region","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

With no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-related CoVs encode 3 tandem macrodomains within nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated antiviral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Mac1 domains exhibit similar structural folds, and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with affinities in the low micromolar range. Importantly, using ADP-ribose-detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate than the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused more than 1.2 million deaths worldwide. With no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic posttranslational process that is increasingly being recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins.

Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interactions are critical for assembly and production of β-coronavirus particles. Here, we sought to characterize the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins during the viral assembly process. By combining biochemical and imaging assays in infected vs. transfected cells, we show that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S as well as its intracellular processing. Indeed, the imaging data reveal that S is re-localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or Golgi compartments upon co-expression of E or M, as observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which prevents syncytia formation. We show that a C-terminal retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of S is required for its M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway.

The RNA synthesis machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an ideal drug target and consists of non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), which is directly responsible for RNA synthesis, and numerous co-factors involved in RNA proofreading and 5′ capping of viral RNAs. The formation of the 5′ 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap structure is known to require a guanylyltransferase (GTase) as well as a 5′ triphosphatase and methyltransferases; however, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping remains poorly understood.

SARS-CoV-2, similar to other previously identified Coronaviridae family members, encodes several structural proteins, such as spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, that are responsible for host penetration, binding, recycling, and pathogenesis. Structural biology has been a key player in understanding the viral infection mechanism and in developing intervention strategies against the new coronavirus.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the Spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is still not known whether heart vascular pericytes (PCs) are infected by SARS-CoV-2, and if the S protein alone provokes PC dysfunction. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of the S protein on primary human cardiac PC signalling and function. Results show, for the first time, that cardiac PCs are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, whilst a recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support endothelial cell (EC) network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Next, adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD147, we discovered that the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in PCs. The neutralisation of CD147, either using a blocking antibody or mRNA silencing, reduced ERK1/2 activation and rescued PC function in the presence of the S protein. In conclusion, our findings suggest that circulating S protein prompts vascular PC dysfunction, potentially contributing to establishing microvascular injury in organs distant from the site of infection. This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implications. Clinical perspective Severe COVID-19 manifests as a microvascular syndrome, but whether SARS-CoV-2 infects and damages heart vascular pericytes (PCs) remains unknown. We provide evidence that cardiac PCs are not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we show that the recombinant S protein alone elicits cellular signalling through the CD147 receptor in cardiac PCs, thereby inducing cell dysfunction and microvascular disruption in vitro. This study suggests that soluble S protein can potentially propagate damage to organs distant from sites of infection, promoting microvascular injury. Blocking the CD147 receptor in patients may help protect the vasculature not only from infection, but also from the collateral damage caused by the S protein.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Results show, for the first time, that cardiac PCs are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, and suggest that circulating S protein prompts vascular PC dysfunction, potentially contributing to establishing microvascular injury in organs distant from the site of infection."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":694,"details":{"paperId":"28453937073af68510ce301b40fca1414316c62f","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8061995","MAG":"3101072897","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1009500","CorpusId":"226959198","PubMed":"33886690"},"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus spike proteins are fine-tuned towards temperature and proteases of the human airways","abstract":"The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for the other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. First, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) reached higher levels in pseudoparticles when produced at 33°C instead of 37°C. Even stronger preference for the upper airway temperature of 33°C was evident for the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus. In contrast, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV favored 37°C, in accordance with their preference for the lower airways. Next, SARS-2-S proved efficiently activated by TMPRSS13, besides the previously identified host cell protease TMPRSS2, which may broaden the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS13 was found to be an effective spike activator for the virulent coronaviruses but not the common cold HCoV-229E virus. Activation by these proteases requires pre-cleavage of the SARS-2-S S1/S2 cleavage loop, and both its furin motif and extended loop length proved critical to achieve virus entry into airway epithelial cells. Finally, we show that the D614G mutation in SARS-2-S increases S protein stability and expression at 37°C, and promotes virus entry via cathepsin B/L activation. These spike properties might promote virus spread, potentially explaining why the G614 variant is currently predominating worldwide. Collectively, our findings indicate how the coronavirus spike protein is fine-tuned towards the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. Coronavirus spikes exhibit distinct temperature preference to precisely match the upper (~33°C) or lower (37°C) airways. We identified airway proteases that activate the spike for virus entry into cells, including one protease that may mediate coronavirus virulence. Also, a link was seen between spike stability and entry via endosomal proteases. This mechanism of spike fine-tuning could explain why the SARS-CoV-2 spike-D614G mutant is more transmissible and therefore globally predominant.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This work reveals features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract, and identified airway proteases that activate the spike for virus entry into cells, including one protease that may mediate coronav virus virulence."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":380,"details":{"paperId":"3783a4cb07661826b5f02d5299755ed67fc463e3","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8553622","MAG":"3112048852","DOI":"10.1038/s41593-021-00926-1","CorpusId":"230647361","PubMed":"34675436"},"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro causes microvascular brain pathology by cleaving NEMO in brain endothelial cells","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected brain endothelial cells undergo cell death due to the cleavage of NEMO by the viral protease Mpro, potentially causing cerebral COVID-19 and ‘long COVID’ symptoms."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":324,"details":{"paperId":"8f70076fc25472eb17892e0ad4ceb67ac68c8313","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7820290","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-20768-y","CorpusId":"231680274","PubMed":"33479198"},"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein forms mutually exclusive condensates with RNA and the membrane-associated M protein","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that the N protein’s central disordered domain drives phase separation with RNA, and that phosphorylation of an adjacent serine/arginine rich region modulates the physical properties of the resulting condensates."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":328,"details":{"paperId":"95a6e72bef469cd74f336781d2d334b4d528b2bf","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8007728","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-21953-3","CorpusId":"232421181","PubMed":"33782395"},"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is dynamic, disordered, and phase separates with RNA","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A simple symmetry-breaking model is offered that provides a plausible route through which single-genome condensation preferentially occurs over phase separation, suggesting that phase separation offers a convenient macroscopic readout of a key nanoscopic interaction."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":289,"details":{"paperId":"156d6e737a1efe3f17e5823b101aa4a911b76c82","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41421-021-00268-z","CorpusId":"256601252"},"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 protein ORF3a inhibits fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The finding that ORF3a strongly inhibited autophagic flux by blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes will facilitate strategies targeting autophagy for conferring potential protection against the spread of SARS-CoV-2."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":660,"details":{"paperId":"61b700dda9919db228614845009b34c7f4212602","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7929867","DOI":"10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003259","CorpusId":"232102474","PubMed":"33656534"},"title":"The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain preferentially recognizes blood group A","abstract":"Key Points The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 shares sequence similarity with an ancient lectin family known to bind blood group antigens.

The current SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic has caused more than 2,000,000 infections globally and nearly 200,000 deaths. Coronaviruses enter susceptible cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus into endosomes. Previous results with SARS and MERS CoV have shown that the Spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity and immunogenicity. Herein, we show that expression of SARS CoV-2 S (S-n) glycoprotein after transient transfection of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells caused extensive cell fusion in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S (S-o) glycoprotein. S-n expression was detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces and caused the formation of very large multinucleated cells (syncytia) by 48 hours post transfection. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. This differential S-n versus S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs for ability to inhibit S-n and S-o cell fusion revealed that the FDA approved HIV-protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n and S-o-mediated cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of cell fusion was observed at a 10 micromolar concentration. Computational modeling and in silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n and S-o-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir mesylate acts on cellular processes to inhibit S proteolytic processing. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate as an antiviral drug, especially at early times after SARS-CoV-2 symptoms appear.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This differential S-n versus S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":329,"details":{"paperId":"2fc84b8d7c422da7b2d5988173f9f1b35152bbc4","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-22785-x","CorpusId":"256687847"},"title":"The architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome inside virion","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"An RNA-RNA hybrid sequencing method is used to predict the secondary and tertiary structure of the SRAS-CoV-2 RNA genome in the virion, providing a framework for studying the genome structure, function, and dynamics of emerging deadly RNA viruses."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":171,"details":{"paperId":"b6476e9c00f49b9e86b71031bd41c4a1f108c7bf","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8683219","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101507","CorpusId":"245263285","PubMed":"34929169"},"title":"The binding of heparin to spike glycoprotein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by three mechanisms","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The results indicate that heparin can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by three mechanisms: by allosterically hindering binding to the host cell receptor, by directly competing with binding to host heparan sulfate proteoglycan co-receptors, and by preventing spike cleavage by furin."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":32,"details":{"paperId":"5ba1f18a02fce54deed21d3e6f6648615372e774","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8362873","DOI":"10.1007/s00216-021-03601-3","CorpusId":"237005266","PubMed":"34389878"},"title":"The challenge of structural heterogeneity in the native mass spectrometry studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions with its host cell-surface receptor","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The utility of native MS complemented with the experimental methods using gas-phase chemistry to obtain meaningful information on the association of the S1 domain of theS-protein with the ACE2 ectodomain, and the influence of a small synthetic heparinoid on this interaction is evaluated."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":364,"details":{"paperId":"306067ba28b2b427f0b8ebb78b92134bef19133d","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2739-1","CorpusId":"256822441"},"title":"The coding capacity of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":null,"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A high-resolution map of coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome enables the identification of 23 unannotated open reading frames and quantification of the expression of canonical viral open readingFrames, and it is shown that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host m RNAs;

At the early stage of infection, SARS-CoV-2 expresses the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), which inhibits host translation by blocking the mRNA entry tunnel on the ribosome; this interferes with the binding of cellular mRNAs to the ribosome. Viral mRNAs, on the other hand, overcome this blockade. We show that NSP1 enhances expression of mRNAs containing the SARS-CoV-2 leader. The first stem-loop (SL1) in viral leader is both necessary and sufficient for this enhancement mechanism. Our analysis pinpoints specific residues within SL1 (three cytosine residues at the positions 15, 19 and 20) and another within NSP1 (R124) which are required for viral evasion, and thus might present promising drug targets.

Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the globe resulting in a severe pandemic with over 500.000 fatalities and large economical and social disruptions in human societies. Gaining knowledge on how SARS-Cov-2 interacts with its host cells and causes COVID-19 is crucial for the intervention of novel therapeutic strategies. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, is a positive-strand RNA virus. The viral RNA is modified by RNA-modifying enzymes provided by the host cell. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopores enables unbiased sensing of canonical and modified RNA bases of the viral transcripts. In this work, we used DRS to precisely annotate the open reading frames and the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications. We provide the first DRS data of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human lung epithelial cells.

Sialic acids are a group of nine-carbon acidic α-keto sugars, usually located at the end of glycans of cell surface glycoconjugates and serve as attachment sites for previous HCoVs. It is therefore speculated that sialic acids on the host cell surface could serve as co-receptors or attachment factors for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry as well. Recent in silico modeling, molecular modeling predictions and microscopy studies indicate potential sialic acid binding by SARS-CoV-2 upon cell entry. In particular, a flat sialic acid-binding domain was proposed at the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, which may lead to the initial contact and interaction of the virus on the epithelium followed by higher affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, likely a two-step attachment fashion. However, recent in vitro and ex vivo studies of sialic acids on ACE2 receptor confirmed an opposite role for SARS-CoV-2 binding. In particular, neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells and ACE2-expressing 293T cells increased SARS-CoV-2 binding. Furthermore, the ACE2 glycosylation inhibition studies indicate that sialic acids on ACE2 receptor prevent ACE2–spike protein interaction. On the other hand, a most recent study indicates that gangliosides could serve as ligands for receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5’UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to shut down host protein synthesis and that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein NSP14 exerts this activity. We show that the translation inhibition activity of NSP14 is conserved in human coronaviruses. NSP14 is required for virus replication through contribution of its exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. Mutations in the ExoN or N7-MTase active sites of SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 abolish its translation inhibition activity. In addition, we show that the formation of NSP14−NSP10 complex enhances translation inhibition executed by NSP14. Consequently, the translational shutdown by NSP14 abolishes the type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Together, we find that SARS-CoV-2 shuts down host innate immune responses via a translation inhibitor, providing insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 is a virus-encoded translation inhibitory factor which shuts down host protein synthesis, including synthesis of antiviral proteins, and that the translation inhibition activity of N SP14 is conserved in human coronaviruses."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":61,"details":{"paperId":"42790cff264269c381ced646050d647d980dde5b","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7896491","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbamem.2021.183590","CorpusId":"231971129","PubMed":"33621516"},"title":"Transport mechanisms of SARS-CoV-E viroporin in calcium solutions: Lipid-dependent Anomalous Mole Fraction Effect and regulation of pore conductance","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is demonstrated that the presence of calcium modulates the transport properties of the E channel by interacting preferentially with charged lipids through different mechanisms including direct Coulombic interactions and possibly inducing changes in membrane morphology."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":492,"details":{"paperId":"dcd5e07d270f9eb050f52b58a82277c85e2d96e2","externalIds":{"MAG":"3026408172","DOI":"10.1101/2020.05.21.109157","CorpusId":"218891685"},"title":"Trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike interacts with dimeric ACE2 with limited intra-Spike avidity","abstract":"A serious public health crisis is currently unfolding due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral entry depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric viral Spike protein (Spike-RBD) and the dimeric human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. While it is clear that strategies to block the Spike/ACE2 interaction are promising as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, our current understanding is insufficient for the rational design of maximally effective therapeutic molecules. Here, we investigated the mechanism of Spike/ACE2 interaction by characterizing the binding affinity and kinetics of different multimeric forms of recombinant ACE2 and Spike-RBD domain. We also engineered ACE2 into a split Nanoluciferase-based reporter system to probe the conformational landscape of Spike-RBDs in the context of the Spike trimer. Interestingly, a dimeric form of ACE2, but not monomeric ACE2, binds with high affinity to Spike and blocks viral entry in pseudotyped virus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays. We show that dimeric ACE2 interacts with an RBD on Spike with limited intra-Spike avidity, which nonetheless contributes to the affinity of this interaction. Additionally, we demonstrate that a proportion of Spike can simultaneously interact with multiple ACE2 dimers, indicating that more than one RBD domain in a Spike trimer can adopt an ACE2-accessible “up” conformation.

One of the major concerns is the emergence of new viral variants that may increase viral transmission and disease severity. In addition to mutations of spike protein, mutations of viral proteins that affect virulence, such as ORF3a, also must be considered. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on ORF3a, to summarize the molecular actions of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, and its role in viral pathogenesis and COVID-19. ORF3a is a polymorphic, multifunctional viral protein that is specific to SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2. It was acquired from β-CoV lineage and likely originated from bats through viral evolution. SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a is a viroporin that interferes with ion channel activities in host plasma and endomembranes. It is likely a virion-associated protein that exerts its effect on the viral life cycle during viral entry through endocytosis, endomembrane-associated viral transcription and replication, and viral release through exocytosis. ORF3a induces cellular innate and pro-inflammatory immune responses that can trigger a cytokine storm, especially under hypoxic conditions, by activating NLRP3 inflammasomes, HMGB1, and HIF-1α to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ORF3a induces cell death through apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis, which leads to tissue damage that affects the severity of COVID-19. ORF3a continues to evolve along with spike and other viral proteins to adapt in the human cellular environment. How the emerging ORF3a mutations alter the function of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and its role in viral pathogenesis and COVID-19 is largely unknown.

ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection triggers cytokine-mediated inflammation, leading to a myriad of clinical presentations in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 8 (ORF8) is a secreted and rapidly evolving glycoprotein. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants with ORF8 deleted are associated with mild disease outcomes, but the molecular mechanism behind this is unknown. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a viral cytokine that is similar to but distinct from interleukin 17A (IL-17A) as it induces stronger and broader human IL-17 receptor (hIL-17R) signaling than IL-17A. ORF8 primarily targeted blood monocytes and induced the heterodimerization of hIL-17RA and hIL-17RC, triggering a robust inflammatory response. Transcriptome analysis revealed that besides its activation of the hIL-17R pathway, ORF8 upregulated gene expression for fibrosis signaling and coagulation dysregulation. A naturally occurring ORF8 L84S variant that was highly associated with mild COVID-19 showed reduced hIL-17RA binding and attenuated inflammatory responses. This study reveals how SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 by a viral mimicry of the IL-17 cytokine contributes to COVID-19 severe inflammation. IMPORTANCE Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants lacking open reading frame 8 (ORF8) have been associated with milder infection and disease outcome, but the molecular mechanism behind how this viral accessory protein mediates disease pathogenesis is not yet known. In our study, we revealed that secreted ORF8 protein mimics host IL-17 to activate IL-17 receptors A and C (IL-17RA/C) and induces a significantly stronger inflammatory response than host IL-17A, providing molecular insights into the role of ORF8 in COVID-19 pathogenesis and serving as a potential therapeutic target.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a viral cytokine that is similar to but distinct from interleukin 17A (IL-17A) as it induces stronger and broader human IL-17 receptor (hil-17R) signaling than IL- 17A."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":76,"details":{"paperId":"8efc3adab8f883c110c7ec3588e2dedd223b4837","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"8868010","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocel.2022.106185","CorpusId":"247084698","PubMed":"35219876"},"title":"Viroporins: Structure, function, and their role in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Among the 29 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the E- and ORF3a proteins have been identified as viroporins that contribute to the massive release of inflammatory cytokines observed in COVID-19."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":120,"details":{"paperId":"62db9ad67da4a812ab2fec5f7e757fa6a57d6546","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"7443692","MAG":"3065141030","DOI":"10.1016/j.chom.2020.08.004","CorpusId":"221257000","PubMed":"32841605"},"title":"Virus-Receptor Interactions of Glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Human ACE2 Receptor","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Glycomics-informed glycoproteomics is utilized to characterize site-specific microheterogeneity of glycosylation for a recombinant trimer Spike mimetic immunogen and for a soluble version of human ACE2, which can facilitate immunogen design to achieve antibody neutralization and inform therapeutic strategies to inhibit viral infection."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":16,"details":{"paperId":"eb50e2e0ab0d3e6b7b26964ebbb7531503d67984","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"9088476","DOI":"10.1002/jmv.27719","CorpusId":"247451919","PubMed":"35288942"},"title":"When cyclin‐dependent kinases meet viral infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2","abstract":"Cyclin‐dependent kinases (CDKs) are protein kinases that play a key role in cell division and transcriptional regulation.

Günther et al. used x-ray crystallography to screen more than 5000 compounds that are either approved drugs or drugs in clinical trials. The screen identified 37 compounds that bind to Mpro. High-resolution structures showed that most compounds bind at the active site but also revealed two allosteric sites where binding of a drug causes conformational changes that affect the active site. In cell-based assays, seven compounds had antiviral activity without toxicity. The most potent, calpeptin, binds covalently in the active site, whereas the second most potent, pelitinib, binds at an allosteric site. Science, this issue p. 642 A repurposed drug-library screen reveals two allosteric drug binding sites of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is creating tremendous human suffering. To date, no effective drug is available to directly treat the disease. In a search for a drug against COVID-19, we have performed a high-throughput x-ray crystallographic screen of two repurposing drug libraries against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is essential for viral replication. In contrast to commonly applied x-ray fragment screening experiments with molecules of low complexity, our screen tested already-approved drugs and drugs in clinical trials. From the three-dimensional protein structures, we identified 37 compounds that bind to Mpro.

Circulating levels of the coagulation cascade activator PAI-1 are substantially higher in patients with COVID-19 with severe respiratory dysfunction than in patients with bacterial sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Indeed, the elevation of PAI-1 is recognized as an early marker of endothelial dysfunction. Here, we report that the rSARS-CoV-2-S1 (recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] viral envelope spike) glycoprotein stimulated robust production of PAI-1 by human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). We examined the role of protein degradation in this SARS-CoV-2-S1 induction of PAI-1 and found that the proteasomal degradation inhibitor bortezomib inhibited SARS-CoV-2-S1–mediated changes in PAI-1. Our data further show that bortezomib upregulated KLF2, a shear-stress–regulated transcription factor that suppresses PAI-1 expression. Aging and metabolic disorders are known to increase mortality and morbidity in patients with COVID-19. We therefore examined the role of ZMPSTE24 (zinc metallopeptidase STE24), a metalloprotease with a demonstrated role in host defense against RNA viruses that is decreased in older individuals and in metabolic syndrome, in the induction of PAI-1 in HPMECs by SARS-CoV-2-S1. Indeed, overexpression of ZMPSTE24 blunted enhancement of PAI-1 production in spike protein–exposed HPMECs. In addition, we found that membrane expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 was reduced by ZMPSTE24-mediated cleavage and shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain, leading to accumulation of ACE2 decoy fragments that may bind SARS-CoV-2. These data indicate that decreases in ZMPSTE24 with age and comorbidities may increase vulnerability to vascular endothelial injury by SARS-CoV-2 viruses and that enhanced production of endothelial PAI-1 might play role in prothrombotic events in patients with COVID-19.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The data indicate that decreases in ZMPSTE24 with age and comorbidities may increase vulnerability to vascular endothelial injury by SARS-CoV-2 viruses and that enhanced production of endothelial PAI-1 might play role in prothrombotic events in COVID-19 patients."}},"tag":"EXP"},{"id":784,"details":{"paperId":"b3d0c47eff097688665c9e3d119d6a02988419c0","externalIds":{"MAG":"3095822337","PubMedCentral":"7693865","DOI":"10.3390/biomedicines8110462","CorpusId":"226250954","PubMed":"33143053"},"title":"miR-98 Regulates TMPRSS2 Expression in Human Endothelial Cells: Key Implications for COVID-19","abstract":"The two main co-factors needed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter human cells are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).

However, how the channel pore opens to mediate cation transport is unclear. Here, we use 13C and 19F solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the conformation and dynamics of ETM at acidic pH and in the presence of calcium ions, which mimic the ERGIC and lysosomal environment experienced by the E protein in the cell. Acidic pH and calcium ions increased the conformational disorder of the N- and C-terminal residues and also increased the water accessibility of the protein, indicating that the pore lumen has become more spacious. ETM contains three regularly spaced phenylalanine (Phe) residues in the center of the peptide. 19F NMR spectra of para-fluorinated Phe20 and Phe26 indicate that both residues exhibit two sidechain conformations, which coexist within each channel. These two Phe conformations differ in their water accessibility, lipid contact, and dynamics. Channel opening by acidic pH and Ca2+ increases the population of the dynamic lipid-facing conformation. These results suggest an intricate aromatic network that regulates the opening of the ETM channel pore.
