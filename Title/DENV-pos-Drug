Although the disease caused by DENV is self-limiting in the first infection, the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect increases the mortality in the second infection with a heterotypic virus. Since there is no specific efficient medicine in treatment, it is urgent to develop vaccines to prevent infection and disease progression. Currently, only a live attenuated vaccine, chimeric yellow fever 17D—tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV), has been licensed for clinical use in some countries, and many candidate vaccines are still under research and development. This review discusses the progress, strengths, and weaknesses of the five types of vaccines including live attenuated vaccine, inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine, viral vectored vaccine, and DNA vaccine.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The progress, strengths, and weaknesses of the five types of vaccines including live attenuated vaccine, inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine, viral vectored vaccine, and DNA vaccine are discussed."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":756,"details":{"paperId":"81bb5bef7f060adf909454ee8fc50460ffb01095","externalIds":{"MAG":"3027347172","DOI":"10.2174/1381612826666200523174753","CorpusId":"218856487","PubMed":"32445444"},"title":"A Review on the Progress and Prospects of Dengue Drug Discovery Targeting NS5 RNA- Dependent RNA Polymerase.","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) infection threatens the health and wellbeing of almost 100 million people in the world. Vectored by mosquitoes, DENV may cause severe disease in human hosts called Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/Dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which are not preventable by any known drug. In the absence of a universally-accepted vaccine, a drug capable of inhibiting DENV multiplication is an urgent and unmet clinical need. Here we summarize inhibitory strategies by targeting either host biochemical pathways or virus-encoded proteins. A variety of approaches have been generated to design Directly-acting antivirals or DAAs targeting different DENV proteins, with mixed success. Among them, DAAs targeting genome replicating viral enzymes have proven effective against many viruses including, Human Immuno-deficiency Virus and Hepatitis C Virus. DAAs may be derived either from existing compound libraries of novel molecules and plant secondary metabolites or devised through Computeraided Drug design (CADD) methods. Here, we focus on compounds with reported DAA-activity against the DENV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which replicates the viral RNA genome. The structure-activity relation (SAR) and toxicity of the natural compounds, including secondary plant metabolites, have been discussed in detail. We have also tabulated the novel compounds with known anti-RdRp activity. We conclude with a list of DAAs for which a co-crystal structure with RdRp is reported. Promising hit compounds are often discarded due to poor selectivity or unsuitable pharmacokinetics. We hope this review will provide a useful reference for further studies into the development of an anti-DENV drug.","publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Review"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"This review focuses on compounds with reported DAA-activity against the DENV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which replicates the viral RNA genome, and tabulated the novel compounds with known anti-Rd Rp activity."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":299,"details":{"paperId":"b6b16ee1494b3b0de394545e78553042bdaf1c4b","externalIds":{"DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03990-6","CorpusId":"238422574","PubMed":"34616043"},"title":"A pan-serotype dengue virus inhibitor targeting the NS3–NS4B interaction","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"A highly potent dengue virus inhibitor (JNJ-A07) that exerts nanomolar to picomolar activity against a panel of 21 clinical isolates that represent the natural genetic diversity of known genotypes and serotypes and reveals a previously undescribed mechanism of antiviral action."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":37,"details":{"paperId":"ee964d6d7ced1fd09f3e8c38b3ffdfd023e31c23","externalIds":{"MAG":"2805513376","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-10-8727-1_23","CorpusId":"44169537","PubMed":"29845543"},"title":"An Industry Perspective on Dengue Drug Discovery and Development.","abstract":null,"publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The article discusses collaborations between the different players in the research field: government and government-sponsored organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academia, and non-profit and philanthropic organizations, and public-private partnerships as a model to boost dengue research and development towards an approved antiviral drug in the near future."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":771,"details":{"paperId":"089183d173479e6ee07d92211bf09249a773a9c1","externalIds":{"MAG":"3036678131","PubMedCentral":"7325986","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2020.01252","CorpusId":"219722635","PubMed":"32655561"},"title":"Anti-dengue Vaccines: From Development to Clinical Trials","abstract":"Dengue Virus (DENV) is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus).

Increasing geographic expansion of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (which transmit the virus) has made dengue a global health concern. There are currently no approved antivirals available to treat dengue, and the only approved vaccine used in some countries is limited to seropositive patients. Treatment of dengue, therefore, remains largely supportive to date; hence, research efforts are being intensified for the development of antivirals. The nonstructural proteins, 3 and 5 (NS3 and NS5), have been the major targets for dengue antiviral development due to their indispensable enzymatic and biological functions in the viral replication process. NS5 is the largest and most conserved nonstructural protein encoded by flaviviruses. Its multifunctionality makes it an attractive target for antiviral development, but research efforts have, this far, not resulted in the successful development of an antiviral targeting NS5. Increase in structural insights into the dengue NS5 protein will accelerate drug discovery efforts focused on NS5 as an antiviral target. In this review, we will give an overview of the current state of therapeutic development, with a focus on NS5 as a therapeutic target against dengue.","publicationTypes":["Review","JournalArticle"],"tldr":{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"Increase in structural insights into the dengue NS5 protein will accelerate drug discovery efforts focused on NS5 as an antiviral target, which is the largest and most conserved nonstructural protein encoded by flaviviruses."}},"tag":"DRUG"},{"id":644,"details":{"paperId":"299e00ee1479b18c386f6c894cd3ee48973d26ca","externalIds":{"PubMedCentral":"3317058","MAG":"2044112890","DOI":"10.1155/2012/628475","CorpusId":"15006643","PubMed":"22529868"},"title":"Dengue Virus Entry as Target for Antiviral Therapy","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) infections are expanding worldwide and, because of the lack of a vaccine, the search for antiviral products is imperative. Four serotypes of DENV are described and they all cause a similar disease outcome. It would be interesting to develop an antiviral product that can interact with all four serotypes, prevent host cell infection and subsequent immune activation. DENV entry is thus an interesting target for antiviral therapy. DENV enters the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Several cellular receptors have been proposed, and DC-SIGN, present on dendritic cells, is considered as the most important DENV receptor until now. Because DENV entry is a target for antiviral therapy, various classes of compounds have been investigated to inhibit this process.
